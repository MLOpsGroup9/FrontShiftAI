Introduction

Welcome and Purpose

The Crouse Medical Practice Employee Handbook summarizes policies, procedures, benefits
and working conditions that will be followed by all employees as a condition of their employment
with Crouse Medical Practice (CMP). These documents are available in full detail to all
employees on a shared drive. Employees will be asked to affirm that they understand where to
access such detailed policies and procedures. Crouse Medical Practice strives to provide an employee-friendly environment in which goaloriented individuals thrive. Our company commitment to serving patients and providing quality
patient care is unwavering. These policies, procedures and working conditions provide a work
environment in which both patient and employee interests are served. We value our employees’ talents, skills and abilities and seek to foster an open, cooperative and
dynamic environment in which we can all excel. Crouse Medical Practice provides an
environment where employees are encouraged to bring ideas and challenges to any level of
management. This handbook contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be
comprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general
policies and procedures described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning
eligibility for a particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should
address your specific questions to the Human Resources Department. No provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical
Practice’s President, or designee. At-Will Employment Statement

Employment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an
employee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time,
for any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it
intended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will
employment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written
contract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual. Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual
right, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it
guarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for
any specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by
Crouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are
disciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to
terminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps. 1 | P a g e

Diversity and Inclusion

 Diversity creates Inclusion. Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and
 those we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be
 successful in his or her work. Diversity isall of the ways we are different as individual people - the characteristics of who
 we are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences. Our culture and values support diversity and inclusion by:

  Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team
  Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s
 and our community
  Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and
 perspectives

Employment

Americans with Disabilities Act

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or
more employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also
requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who
are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform
the essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of
individuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate
against qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,
advancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of
employment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided
without creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given
the same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and
employees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the
requested accommodations result in the following:

  A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace
 and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or
  An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company
ADA policy. 4 | P a g e

The Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including
the resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues. Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation. Employee Classification

Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as
determined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:

  Exempt - Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including
 managerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
 Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or
 part-time status.  Non-Exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards. Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these
 employees. Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their fulltime or part-time status. Employment Resignation and Termination

Termination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons
for termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your
anticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and
exempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice
(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract). Upon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with
an accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year. In the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work
force, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off
(PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be
specifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please
refer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. If you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will
assume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline
Policy #600-002. 5 | P a g e

Employment Status

FULL-TIME - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such
full-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service
have been met. PART-TIME - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be parttime and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who
work on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s
Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other
employee benefits. PER DIEM - Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of
hours. These employees are not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except legally
mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits). CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE - Employees who have a written contract with CMP that defines

Workers’ Compensation

Crouse Medical Practice will provide workers’ compensation, a type of accident and injury
insurance that compensates an employee for lost wages, medical expenses and permanent
impairment that results from an injury arising out of or in the course of work. Employees must
report any work-related injury or disease immediately (or as soon as practicable) to their
supervisor and Human Resources so that the necessary paperwork can be completed in a
timely manner. Please note that under state laws, employees who fail to report work-related
injuries in a timely manner may see a reduction or denial of their workers’ compensation
benefits. If an employee is able to return to work after an injury or illness for which he or she was
receiving workers’ compensation, the employee must provide documentation from his or her
medical provider that either outlines any work-related restrictions or verifies that the employee is
able to complete all job-related tasks. In the event that an employee is able to return to work
under restrictions, the company will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the
employee’s work ability and job responsibilities. If and when the medical provider removes all
work restrictions, the employee is expected to perform his or her regular duties and will no
longer receive workers’ compensation benefits. FMLA leave and workers’ compensation leave will be applied concurrently when possible. Time Away From Work

Workers’ Compensation

Crouse Medical Practice will provide workers’ compensation, a type of accident and injury
insurance that compensates an employee for lost wages, medical expenses and permanent
impairment that results from an injury arising out of or in the course of work. Employees must
report any work-related injury or disease immediately (or as soon as practicable) to their
supervisor and Human Resources so that the necessary paperwork can be completed in a
timely manner. Please note that under state laws, employees who fail to report work-related
injuries in a timely manner may see a reduction or denial of their workers’ compensation
benefits. If an employee is able to return to work after an injury or illness for which he or she was
receiving workers’ compensation, the employee must provide documentation from his or her
medical provider that either outlines any work-related restrictions or verifies that the employee is
able to complete all job-related tasks. In the event that an employee is able to return to work
under restrictions, the company will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the
employee's work ability and job responsibilities. If and when the medical provider removes all
work restrictions, the employee is expected to perform his or her regular duties and will no
longer receive workers’ compensation benefits. FMLA leave and workers’ compensation leave will be applied concurrently when possible. Time Away From Work
Bereavement Leave

Crouse Medical Practice has taken into consideration the personal needs that arise from the
death of an immediate family member. In the event of such a loss:

e Anemployee will be allowed up to five (5) days of leave with full pay until and including
the day of the funeral in the event of a loss of a spouse or domestic partner and children
(to include step-children)."

Employees should notify their supervisor of the need to use bereavement leave. Within a
reasonable period of time, the employee may be required to provide verification of need, such
as an obituary. Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

As an employee of Crouse Medical Practice, you may be eligible to take unpaid family and
medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Eligible employees may take up to a
total of 12 weeks of job-protected FMLA leave within a rolling 12-month period, measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. If you have questions regarding
FMLA, please contact Human Resources. Eligibility

To be eligible for leave, you must have been employed by the Organization for at least 12
months. In the 12 months immediately preceding the beginning of the leave, you must also have
worked at least 1,250 hours to qualify for federal FMLA. FMLA may be requested for any combination of the following reasons:

  The birth of an employee’s newborn child or the placement of a child with the employee
 for adoption or foster care
  To care for the employee’s spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition
  The employee has a serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform
 the functions of their job
  A qualifying exigency that arises because the employee’s spouse, child or parent is a
 covered military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending
 call or order to covered active duty)
  To care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the employee is
 the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the service member (military
 caregiver leave) (26 weeks)

Such leaves may be taken all at once or, when medically necessary, intermittently or on a
reduced leave schedule. The need for leave must be documented by your treating health care
provider through our medical certification process. In the case where the leave is for an
employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty statement will be required in order
for you to return from a medical leave. Failure to provide the statement will result in a delay in
your return to work. If an employee is provided group health insurance, the employee is entitled
to the continuation of the group health insurance coverage during FMLA leave on the same
terms as if he or she had continued to work. If family member coverage is provided to an
employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. The employee
must continue to make any normal contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. Please contact Human Resources for additional information. 20 | P a g e

  to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active
 military duty. For further information please refer to CMP’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020. Paid Time Off (PTO)

Crouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away
from work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)
program to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to
decide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule. Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:

  As vacation
  For personal business
  For periods of illness
  For religious observation
  For doctor or dental appointments
  For personal or family emergencies
  In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions

Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual

All full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO
hours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total
amount of PTO time in two equally divided “buckets” to current employees in the beginning of
the first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year. Time allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. - the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):

  Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the
 employee’s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the
 completion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires.  Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an
 exempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If
 they work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than 1
 hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the
 month following the date of hire for new hires. When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to
determine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or
with less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees

The standard pay period at Crouse Medical Practice consists of two (2), 7-day, 40 hour weeks
and starts on a Sunday and ends on the second following Saturday. Employees will be paid on
a bi-weekly basis on Friday. If paydays fall on non-workdays or holidays, employees will be paid
on the last workday prior to the regularly scheduled payday. It is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to offer employee's the option to receive payments via
electronic direct deposit and/or live payroll check. The payroll office or Human Resources will
assist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any
questions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit. 32|Page

## Page 39

Crouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for
employees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will
be electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated
by each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or
credit unions that support direct deposit. It is each employee’s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal
information and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has
been an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not
entitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid
amounts from future paychecks. Paychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be
released to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the
employee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on
the date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or
she returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day. If an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to
payroll information through the Company’s payroll service provider. Performance Evaluation

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,
about your job performance. Managers and supervisors are responsible for providing ongoing
performance feedback to each employee. In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally
discuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may
be conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position. Your performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas
needing improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance
problems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal
discussions or formal disciplinary action. Formal performance feedback becomes a permanent
part of your personnel file. Please contact Human Resources if you have any questions. Personnel Records

Crouse Medical Practice strives to keep accurate and up-to-date personnel records. Employee personnel files may include the following:

  Employee demographic information
  Job application
  Position description
  Resume/CV
  Training records/Educational Degrees/Certifications

At all company social functions, employees are responsible for behaving in a professional
manner. While alcohol may be served at company events outside of business hours, employees
should refrain from becoming intoxicated. Even at social events, employees must remember that they are representing the company and
need to ensure that they are upholding the company’s positive reputation at all times. Telephone & Cell Phone Usage

Crouse Medical Practice provides phones to employees to increase efficiency in doing
business. There are important things to consider when using company phones. Please adhere
to the following guidelines, based on the type of call you are making or receiving:

  Business phone calls - Much of our business is conducted over the phone, making our
 telephone communication extremely important. A friendly but professional telephone
 manner should always be projected.  Personal phone calls - We recognize that periodically, personal phone calls must be
 made or received during the business hours. Such calls should be held at a minimum so
 that they do not interfere with the workflow. Additionally, these calls should be made
 outside of any patient care or public area.  Personal cell phone - Unless required for your job, cell phone usage will not be allowed
 for personal calls, text messaging, surfing the Internet, receiving or responding to email,
 checking phone messages or any other purpose during business hours. Please inform
 family and friends that your cell phone will be unavailable during work hours. If there is
 an emergency family/friends should attempt to reach you by calling the office first. Cell phone calls are permitted during lunch or break times in the breakroom or
 outdoors, or in a private office, but not in the general office areas.  Voicemail - Many company telephones are also equipped with voicemail. Voicemail was
 installed to help maintain our high quality of service for patients and to increase
 efficiency throughout the office. Please be sure to check your voicemail regularly and
 respond appropriately to inquiries left via voicemail. In advance of planned absences
 (PTO days), an outgoing out-of-office message should be recorded to inform callers who
 to reach in your absence and/or your return date. For specific details, please refer to CMP’s Telephone & Cell Phone policy #600-007. Travel Reimbursement

Crouse Medical Practice will reimburse travel expenses with correct approval and authorization. All employees and physicians are required to follow the Travel Reimbursement Policy #400-009

THE COMPANY

 The Company is dedicated to four simple business principles:

 1. Service. To provide our clients (patients, residents, families, visitors, and
 employees) with the best service possible with a concentration on consistency,
 quality control, and systems operations. Our standardized operation methods are
 set and never compromised. 2. Professionalism. To bring to our industry and our services a professional

 It is the policy of the Company that all employees are employed at the will of the
Company. Employees are subject to termination at any time, for any reason, with or without
cause or notice. At the same time, employees may terminate their employment at any time and
for any reason. No Company representative is authorized to modify this policy for any employee or to
enter into any agreement, oral or written, that changes the at-will relationship. PROBATION PERIOD

quality of your work, your attendance/tardiness record, your attitude, and your ability to
cooperate with co-workers, residents, patients, and visitors. Completion of the Probation Period does not change the employee's status as an at-will

POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION

Purpose

The Company is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated
with respect and dignity. This commitment includes a work environment free of unlawful
harassment and unlawful discrimination. It also includes a work environment free of retaliation
for reporting claims of harassment and/or discrimination, or for participating in an investigation of
a complaint of harassment or discrimination. Our policy is to educate employees as to the
behaviors that constitute harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination, and to make them
aware of reporting procedures and consequences for those who engage in these prohibited
behaviors. Harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated. Coverage

This policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, and prohibits
harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other unprofessional conduct by or toward all employees
at all levels of the Company, as well as applicants, unpaid interns, volunteers, independent
contractors, temporary workers, vendors, client representatives and other customers. Individual Employee Liability for Harassment

All employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,
vice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be
held personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct."
Healthcare,General Business,handbook,Healthcare Services Group,ADA|HARASSMENT|TITLE VII,harassment|unlawful|offensive|that|conduct,2025-11-14T22:06:37.485670,955,"Individual Employee Liability for Harassment

All employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,
vice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be
held personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct. Workplace Harassment is a Form of Discrimination

Unlawful harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Please be aware that some state laws may
provide for enhanced protection. Unlawful harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person’s legally protected characteristics,
including those listed in this policy where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition
of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work
environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name
calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs,
offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a
variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:
  The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the
 employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee.  The victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the
 offensive conduct.  Unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim. POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION
Purpose

The Company is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated
with respect and dignity. This commitment includes a work environment free of unlawful
harassment and unlawful discrimination. It also includes a work environment free of retaliation
for reporting claims of harassment and/or discrimination, or for participating in an investigation of
a complaint of harassment or discrimination. Our policy is to educate employees as to the
behaviors that constitute harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination, and to make them
aware of reporting procedures and consequences for those who engage in these prohibited
behaviors. Harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated. Coverage

This policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, and prohibits
harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other unprofessional conduct by or toward all employees
at all levels of the Company, as well as applicants, unpaid interns, volunteers, independent
contractors, temporary workers, vendors, client representatives and other customers. Individual Employee Liability for Harassment

All employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,
vice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be
held personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct. Workplace Harassment is a Form of Discrimination

Unlawful harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Please be aware that some state laws may
provide for enhanced protection. Unlawful harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person’s legally protected characteristics,
including those listed in this policy where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition
of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work
environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name
calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs,
offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a
variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:
e The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the
employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee. e The victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the
offensive conduct. e Unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim."

In keeping with this commitment, the Company maintains a strict policy prohibiting all forms of
unlawful harassment and discrimination of any kind, as defined under federal law, state law, or

based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding or medical conditions related to
pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding), race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and
protected hairstyles), religion, religious creed (including observance, practice, beliefs, and
practices such as, religious dress and grooming practices), color, gender (including gender identity,
gender expression, transgender status, transitioning or perceived to be transitioning), national
origin (including physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics, marriage to or association with
persons of a national origin group, tribal affiliation, membership in or association with an
organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group, name
that is associated with a national origin group, accent, language use, immigration status,
citizenship, and other definitions under state laws), ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical
condition, genetic information, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status, union status, or
any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation. It also prohibits
harassment, disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on the perception that anyone has any
of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of
those characteristics. This policy prohibits unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical, and visual
harassment. It also prohibits retaliation of any kind against individuals who file complaints of
harassment or discrimination, or who assist in an employer investigation. Employees who violate
this policy are subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination. This policy also strictly prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined as (i) unwelcome sexual
advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s employment; or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual; or (3) such
conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual
misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of
authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. Sexual harassment includes many
forms of offensive behavior, and is not excused because the harasser is attracted to the victim of
the harassment. The following is a partial list of the types of conduct which could constitute sexual
harassment:

1. Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual
advances, invitation or comments and comments about any employee’s body or clothing, verbal

CALL-IN REQUIREMENTS

 Reporting to work on your scheduled workdays and being on time are very important, and
excessive absences or lateness can lead to discharge. If for any reason you will not be able to work a
scheduled shift, or you will be getting to work late, you must call-in as soon as possible so that your
supervisor will have time to try to make adjustments to the schedule. Your supervisor will give you a form with specific instructions about the call-in requirements for
the facility you are working in. You must follow those instructions. If you lose that form, or never
received it, be sure to get one from your supervisor. Note that you must talk to your supervisor directly
as part of your call-in responsibilities."

UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE

 Healthcare provides three types of unpaid leaves of absence, depending upon the
circumstances of the employee's need and the employee's employment status: Military
Leave, Family and Medical Leave, and Personal Leave. Each is described below. Requests for any type of unpaid leave of absence must be submitted to your supervisor at
least one (1) month in advance of the expected starting date, or as soon as reasonably possible. You will need to state the reason for the leave, the requested date of the beginning of the leave,
and the date you expect to return from the leave. Requests normally will be approved or denied
within ten (10) days of receipt of the request. Employees who have been granted unpaid leave are prohibited from working
elsewhere in any capacity that is inconsistent with the reason for their leave, without the
written permission of their supervisor. Violators may be discharged. A. MILITARY LEAVE

 Employees will be granted Military Leave in accordance with applicable law. B. FAMILYANDMEDICALLEAVE

Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid
family or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month
period. Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already
taken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,
as described below. To be eligible for a Family/Medical Leave, an employee must have worked
for the Company for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to
taking the leave, and work at a worksite with 50 or more employees located within 75 miles. Hours
worked means actual hours worked and generally does not include paid or unpaid time off. However, periods of absence from work due to or necessitated by qualifying military service are
counted towards an employee’s eligibility for FMLA leave. The “12-month period” for determining FMLA eligibility is a rolling period, measured backward
from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave."

If a leave is requested because of the employee’s or a covered family member’s serious health
condition or to care for a Covered Service member, the employee and the relevant health care
provider must supply appropriate medical certification. Medical Certification Forms may be
obtained from the Healthcare Human Resources Department. If the need for leave is foreseeable,

Department. It is the employee’s responsibility, not the health care provider’s, to ensure that
Healthcare’s Human Resources Department receives the fully completed medical certification by
the deadline. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in
delay or denial of leave. Under certain circumstances, the Company, at its expense, may require
an examination of the employee by a second health care provider designated by the Company. If
the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the

Human Resources Department. Certification

If a leave is requested because of the employee’s or a covered family member’s serious health
condition or to care for a Covered Service member, the employee and the relevant health care
provider must supply appropriate medical certification. Medical Certification Forms may be
obtained from the Healthcare Human Resources Department. If the need for leave is foreseeable,
the medical certification should be provided to the Company prior to the commencement of the
leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, then the medical certification must be provided
within fifteen (15) days after it is requested, or as deadline extensions are granted in writing by
Healthcare’s Human Resources

Department. It is the employee’s responsibility, not the health care provider’s, to ensure that
Healthcare’s Human Resources Department receives the fully completed medical certification by
the deadline. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in
delay or denial of leave. Under certain circumstances, the Company, at its expense, may require
an examination of the employee by a second health care provider designated by the Company. If
the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the
Company, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct
an examination and provide a final and binding opinion. The Company also may require medical
recertification periodically during the leave and may ask for clarification of any medical
certification submitted. Certification also is required for Qualifying Exigency Leave. Certification forms are available
from the Healthcare Human Resources Department. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities

Medical and Other Benefits

During an approved Family/Medical Leave, the Company will maintain an employee’s group
health benefits as if the employee had continued to be actively employed, for up to a total of 12
weeks (or 26 weeks if Covered Service member Leave is taken) in a 12-month period."
Healthcare,General Business,handbook,Healthcare Services Group,COBRA,leave|employee|work|schedule|reduced,2025-11-14T22:06:37.543979,980,"If an
employee takes more than 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if applicable) of approved Family/Medical Leave
in a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee’s sole
expense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work. If paid leave
is substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee’s portion
of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If the leave is unpaid, an employee
must pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease
for the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late. If an employee
does not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the
Company for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during
unpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or
other circumstances beyond the employee’s control. Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave

Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a
schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday. 1. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as
 “baby-bonding” leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually
 agreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be
 taken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;

 2. Leave due to an employee’s own serious health condition, to care for an employee’s
 spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service
 member relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where
 medically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;

 3. Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impending
 call to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
 intermittent or reduced work schedule. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits. Medical and Other Benefits

Returning From Leave

Generally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same
position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,
subject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to
reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the
Family/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement
following Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates
if an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable
law. If leave is taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition, then the employee must
provide medical certification addressing the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will
not be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided. Legal Compliance

This policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this
policy. Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,
whether or not specifically set forth in this policy. C. PERSONAL LEAVE

Employees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a
period up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also
be requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet
the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by
employees who need a period of leave due to a ""disability"" within the meaning of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (or similar state law). Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a
request for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the
Company will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the
Company's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (and comparable state laws). An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former
position and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions
of employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal
Leave will be returned to his or her former position. Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on
a Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health
insurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under
COBRA, to continue that coverage at their own expense, provided they make timely payments. Returning From Leave

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND
 ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)

 HIPAA PRIVACY RULE AS IT RELATES TO OUR SERVICES

 The federal government's HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that Personal Health Information
about patients/residents is protected and kept private and secure. Under HIPAA's privacy and
information security section, it is illegal to release health information to inappropriate parties or
fail to adequately protect Personal Health Information from release. The HIPAA Privacy Rule
applies to covered entities - most health care providers - including long term care facilities
and assisted living facilities. Most health care providers do not carry out all their health care activities by themselves. Instead, they often use the services of a variety of other persons and businesses. These other
persons and businesses are called Business Associates in the HIPAA law. Business Associates
perform functions on behalf of the health care provider and are bound by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. From time to time, a Business Associate in performing its duties will come in contact with
Personal Health Information. Rules governing the use and disclosure of Personal Health
Information apply to Business Associates, as well as health care providers. Healthcare is not a Business Associate when it provides Housekeeping/Laundry/
Maintenance services. HIPAA specifically excludes entities that provide
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance services from the law because the work being performed
does not involve the use or disclosure of Personal Health Information. However, since our
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with
Personal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law. Healthcare is a Business Associate when it provides Food Services and is required to
comply with HIPAA. Food Service consists of the development of a meal plan that meets the
patients/residents dietary needs in connection with the over all medical plan developed in
conjunction with the health care facility. In meeting its responsibilities, Healthcare's Food
Service department on a regular basis comes in contact with residents'/patients' Personal
Health Information and must keep this information confidential. The HIPAA Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect individual's medical
records and other Personal Health Information.  It gives patients/residents more control over their health information.  It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.  It establishes appropriate safeguards that workers in a health care facility
 must follow to protect the privacy of health information.  It holds violators accountable. HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND

residents'/patients' information and records by not following our privacy and security policies may
result in disciplinary action. What Is Confidential Personal Health Information? Patients/residents expect that only the people who are caring for them will see their health
information and that it will only be used to help care for them. Confidential Personal Health

Ways to Protect Confidentiality

Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:

  Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a
 resident's/patient's room.  If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information
 remember to keep it confidential.  If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the
 information desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself.  Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your
 job responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential. Food Service Employees:

  Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private
 by closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so
 that others may not overhear them.  Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have
 access to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public
 areas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor.  Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information
 and are confidential.  Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers
 logged into resident information while they are not at their workstation.  Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away
 from the view of the public or people passing by.  Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it.  Do not store Personal Health Information in common files.  Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the
 facility. Ways to Protect Confidentiality

Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:

. Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a
resident's/patient's room. . If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information
remember to keep it confidential. . If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the
information desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself. . Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your
job responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential. Food Service Employees:

. Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private
by closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so
that others may not overhear them. . Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have
access to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public
areas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor. . Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information
and are confidential. . Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers
logged into resident information while they are not at their workstation. . Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away
from the view of the public or people passing by. . Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it. . Do not store Personal Health Information in common files. . Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the
facility. ---

Protecting confidentiality depends on you. You must not share information that you overhear or
see in the course of your work. Doing so is a violation of the law. When you do see or hear
information in the course of doing your job, remember that the information is confidential and you
are not allowed to repeat it or share it with others. This applies even when you no longer work at
the facility. Reporting Non-Compliance

 Employees are encouraged to report non-compliance to your immediate supervisor. If you
feel that corrective action has not been taken concerning your report, you should contact
Healthcare's Corporate Compliance Officer at 1-800-523-2248. Employees will not be punished
for reporting violations."

you suspect that the privacy or confidentiality policies have been broken. CHEMICAL USE

 Like most jobs, there are possible hazards that you should be aware of before beginning
employment. The chemicals that you use are never dangerous when used in their proper dilution
and for the use for which they are intended. However, if a patient/resident were to swallow a
chemical, or you were to accidentally spray yourself in the eye, adverse reactions can and will
occur. Always follow these guidelines:

 1. Never use a chemical for something other than for what it is intended. 2. Always make sure that all bottles have proper labels. If not, report it immediately to
 your supervisor. 3. Avoid using old bottles for new chemicals. Even though the bottle may appear dry, a
 residue of the previous chemical often remains and could cause a chemical reaction. 4. Each housekeeping cart has a lockbox. All chemicals are to be stored in the lockbox.

INFECTION CONTROL

 Because many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and
are more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as
sanitary an environment as possible. By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,
employees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause
infection:

 1. Direct contact with infected person. 2. Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person. 3. The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents. 4. Spread through insects. 5. Inoculation. Some Things to Remember:

 1. Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of all
 resident rooms and bathrooms. 2. All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contact
 will not do the job. 3."

 contents, ingredients, and antidote. 6. No cleaning or working around food while it is being served. 7. Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentation
 which will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution. 8. Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breeding
 grounds. 9. Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry. 10. Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination. 11. Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect any
 communicable disease. 12. Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because the
 disinfecting agents are still at work on your skin. 13. Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs. INFECTION CONTROL

SUBSTANCE ABUSE

 In order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients
and a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be
physically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. Therefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,
illegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient
manner. No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic
beverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in
Company vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the
safety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships
with its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal. Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical
treatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to
their supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another
assignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public. To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever
measures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used
at, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company
believes them to be justified and necessary."

will not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit
will result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination. Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily
seek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require
management referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered

Holiday Market and Its Relationship to Spartan Stores

 Holiday Market is an independent grocer and a member of the Spartan Stores grocery collective. Spartan
Stores is a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: SPTN) that was formed in 1917 by nineteen independent retailers who
joined forces to collectively buy groceries to obtain lower prices. Until that time, each of the independent grocers
purchased food products separately from manufacturers at higher prices and competed with the more powerful chains
(A&P and Kroger) individually. They did not fare well against the bigger chain stores until they got together. Just as with earlier generations of independent grocers, Holiday Market’s membership in Spartan Stores
gives us certain advantages. First and foremost, our Spartan affiliation gives us buying power, and behind-the-scenes
support in areas such as advertising, merchandising, and computerized inventory and pricing. By concentrating our
purchasing through Spartan Stores, Inc., we strengthen our company and strengthen other Spartan markets, thus
insuring low-cost purchasing. As an independent, family-owned local retailer, Holiday Market believes that good people working together
toward a common goal can accomplish anything they want to do. In this spirit, we set our goal to give the best service
we can and to fulfill the needs of our customers. Every action we take should be made with this in mind, as our first
responsibility is our customers. To help us achieve this goal, we feel we must meet the needs of our own associates. We owe our associates
the same degree of respect, loyalty, and commitment we ask of them. We hope to provide opportunities to grow
personally and professionally by providing proper training and a good work environment. We are guided by a strong sense of social responsibility to the community where our store is located and
where we live and work. We will seek to accomplish this responsibility through voluntary corporate and individual
efforts. We share with our suppliers the goal of bringing quality products to the marketplace, and consider them equal
partners in this task. Our goal is to offer consumers state-of-the-art shopping with a service-oriented emphasis. We hope to make
shopping a unique experience worth repeating, time after time/ Holiday Market is proud to be part of the Spartan
family, and pleased to have the opportunity to extend our quality services and products to you and all shoppers in the
communities we serve. Thank you for choosing us as your place of employment. Welcome to Holiday Market."

Workplace Searches

For the safety and security of our associates, visitors, customers and property, Holiday Market reserves the right to
inspect the contents of all vehicles, packages, purses, bags, lockers, contains and other items brought onto company
premises or used/possessed while engaged in company business. Under certain circumstances involving reasonable
suspicion of improper conduct (violation of the Workplace Violence and Weapons Policy, violation of the
Alcohol/Controlled Substances Policy, etc.,) the company may request associates to submit to a search of their
personal effects. Refusal to consent to any search or cooperate in any investigation may result in disciplinary action up
to and including discharge. All searches will be conducted with due regard for the privacy of the persons involved. Harassment-Free Work Place

Holiday Market expects all of its associates to conduct themselves with dignity and respect for fellow associates,
customers, the public and others. Each associate has the right to work in an environment free from unlawful
harassment and discrimination in any form, from any source. Unlawfully harassing anyone, including but not limited
to sexual or racial harassment, will not be tolerated. Unlawful harassment is serious and pervasive unwelcome
conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based on a person’s race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin,
height, weight, marital status, veteran status, disability or other protected characteristic. The company prohibits harassment of any employee. Sexual harassment is prohibited because it is intimidating and an
abuse of power and is inconsistent with the Company’s policies, practice and management philosophy. Sexual
harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can take the following forms:
- Sexual conduct that interferes with another person’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or
 offensive work environment. - Personnel decisions (promotion, raises, scheduling etc.) made by a manager or boss based on the associate’s
 submission to or rejection of sexual advances

- Submission to a sexual advance used as a condition of keeping or getting a job, whether expressed in explicit or
 implicit terms. This policy covers associate conduct not just in the workplace, but also at clients’ place of business, and at Companysponsored social events. Holiday Market does not permit harassment whether engaged in by fellow associates,
mangers, customers, vendors or other non-associates who conduct business with Holiday Market. Any associate who
violates this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge. Compliant Procedure for Harassment

Employees who have been subjected to or have witnessed harassment should report it immediately to the Human
Resources Department or to one of the owners. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated
thoroughly, immediately and as confidentially as practicable. Prompt and appropriate remedial action will be taken to
eliminate harassment from the work place. No associate will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith. All management representatives are required to notify the Human Resources Department or a company owner should
an instance of discrimination or harassment be brought to their attention. Failure to do so could result in discipline, up
to and including discharge

No Retaliation

We cannot try to remedy claimed harassment or retaliation unless you inform us about it. Failure to report such claims
prevents us from taking steps to remedy the problem. No associate will be subject to, and the Company prohibits, any
form of discipline or retaliation for good faith reporting of perceived violations of this policy, pursuing any such claim,
or cooperating in the investigation of such claims. If you believe someone has violated this no-retaliation policy,
please contact an owner or your designated Human Resources representative. Anyone, regardless of position or title,
whom the Company determines has violated this policy will be subject to discipline, including possible termination. Qualified Individuals with Disabilities

Holiday Market complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Persons with Disabilities Civil
Rights Act protecting qualified individuals against discrimination in employment. We also provide reasonable
accommodation for such individuals with disabilities in accordance with these laws. If an employee believes that
accommodation of a disability is necessary to perform the essential functions of a position, Michigan law requires the
employee to notify Holiday Market of this need in writing within 182 days after the employee knows or reasonably
should have known of the need for accommodation. All requests for reasonable accommodation must be referred to
your Human Resources representative. Relatives/Personal Relationships in the Workplace

 1. Restrictions on Employing “Family Members”: Holiday Market is a family-owned business. Therefore, we
 understand the value of hiring and working with relatives. We subscribe to a practice of “full disclosure” when
 employing someone who may be related to an existing associate, and/or with whom that associate has a closer
 personal relationship. This includes blood relatives, relatives by marriage, individuals living in your household,
 or those with whom you have an intimate or personal relationship. The appropriateness of such parties working
 together will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Normally, this individual will be prohibited from working in
 the department of and being managed by their “relative.” Managers who may, from time to time, have relative
 or close friend working in their department will be restricted from participating in employment decisions such
 as discipline, training, or promotions regarding this person. In those cases, a company owner or another
 assigned manager will oversee those personnel decisions. 2. Exceptions for Family Members Employed on Seasonal Basis: Sometimes, a family member will possess prior
 training in a department, such as cashiering or deli, and be hired by us during a holiday season."

 them your undivided attention. Answer, or obtain an answer, to all customer questions. 2. Checking on an Item: Holiday Market has built its reputation on customer service. Therefore, when you make a

Customer Returns
Customer returns must be handled by the manager of the department where the product originated. For example, a
cake return should be handled by the Bakery Manager. If the department manager is not available, call the Store
Manager to authorize the return. Never Argue with a customer. Treat them graciously until the manager takes over. Customer Complaints
Regardless of the type of complaint brought to you - LISTEN! Do not interrupt the customer. Be understanding. Thank them for bringing the matter to your attention and apologize for any inconvenience. Explain to the customer
that the Store Manager, or Department Manager will be happy to help them. Create an atmosphere of helpfulness. Show your gratitude for the chance to correct a mistake. When you do so, the
customer will leave feeling satisfied. Service Policy
All of our customers are to receive the same efficient, friendly, courteous service, regardless of race, color, religion,
age, gender, disability, height, weight, marital status, physical appearance or any other characteristic. Do not hesitate
to help a customer in need. Remember, our fellow associates are also customer. Treat them with the same courtesy you would a non-associate. Customer Accidents
Accidents demand immediate action. In all cases, alert the Department Manager or Store Manager at once, regardless
of whether you think medical attention is required. Give all possible assistance to the customer. Under no
circumstances are you to make any promise or statement that would obligate you or this company for payment of
medical expenses or damage. It is very important that you never make a statement acknowledging responsibility. If a
customer’s clothing is soiled, torn or otherwise damaged, do not take it upon yourself to promise payment. In an
emergency, stay with them until it is resolved or until you are excused from the scene. Breakage of Merchandise in the Store or Parking Lot
If a customer breaks an item, approach the customer and put them at ease by saying “Not to worry, accidents happen.”
Tell the customer they should continue to shop, and you will take care of the damaged merchandise. It is very
important that the customer is not made to feel guilty. Accidents tend to happen. Begin the clean-up, but call
maintenance to help/finish up with the clean-up. Store Cleanliness
A clean store attracts and retains customers. All of us need to help keep our store clean. Please try to be aware of any
papers or debris in the aisle or parking lot, and take a few extra seconds to pick them up and discard or put back in the
proper location. The cleanliness of a store is a direct reflection of its associates. Donations
Refer any customer asking for donations or discounts to a store owner or store manager. Associates are prohibited
from authorizing such transactions. Page 14 of 38

Associate Purchases

We want our associates to shop at Holiday Market. You’re some of our best customers! However, because you
are an associate, we require that you follow these rules:

 1. Do your shopping after you punch out: Only shop during breaks/lunches, or at the end of your shift. 2. Pay for it first: All purchases are to be paid for at the cash register before they are consumed or taken
 home. Failure to do so could lead to immediate discharge. 3. Keep your receipt: Please keep receipts for all your purchases throughout the day. We spot-check
 associates to determine if the product you are eating/taking out of the store has been paid for. Associates
 who cannot produce a receipt will be disciplined, up to and including discharge. 4. Take purchases to your car: All purchases for home consumption must be rung through the register and
 removed from the store once you have paid for them. You may not collect items for purchase and put them
 in your department walk-ins or coolers to purchase and take home at a later date/time. 5. Do not transact your relatives: You are not permitted to scan, weigh or price your own items of any
 relative or person residing in your household, or friend. Please advise them of this to avoid embarrassment. 6. Never mis-price an item: Anyone who labels a more-expensive item as a cheaper item so that it rings up
 at a cheaper price will be fired. This is called “sweet-hearting” and is theft. Any associate caught doing
 this will be immediately terminated. 7. Be prepared for inspection: We reserve the right to inspect all items taken from the store. All bags, boxes
 and packages removed from the store are subject to being spot checked by the Department or Store
 manager at any time. 8. Removing unpaid merchandise: Never exit the building with unpaid merchandise. This is considered
 stealing and may result in discharge. 9. Employee Charging: If you choose to employee charge your purchase, that amount will be withdrawn
 from your following week’s paycheck. (Monday-Sunday with payday on the following Thursday) If you
 overcharge your check amount, you will be automatically removed from store charging again on your
 check for 2 weeks. Page 20 of 38

relative or person residing in your household, or friend. Please advise them of this to avoid embarrassment. Never mis-price an item: Anyone who labels a more-expensive item as a cheaper item so that it rings up
at a cheaper price will be fired. This is called “sweet-hearting” and is theft. Any associate caught doing
this will be immediately terminated. . Be prepared for inspection: We reserve the right to inspect all items taken from the store. All bags, boxes

and packages removed from the store are subject to being spot checked by the Department or Store
manager at any time. . Removing unpaid merchandise: Never exit the building with unpaid merchandise. This is considered

stealing and may result in discharge. . Employee Charging: If you choose to employee charge your purchase, that amount will be withdrawn

from your following week’s paycheck. (Monday-Sunday with payday on the following Thursday) If you
overcharge your check amount, you will be automatically removed from store charging again on your
check for 2 weeks. Page 20 of 38

Resignation Policy

Whenever possible, please give us a two weeks’ notice of your intent to resign. This gives us time to train a
replacement without business interruption. Associates who provide a two weeks’ notice and actually work the
scheduled hours they were assigned (rather than using PTO in lieu of working) will receive pay for any unused PTO
time earned as of January 1st of the calendar year of employment. Associates who do not provide a two weeks’ notice
and/or who fail to work their schedule will not receive payout for unused time. Layoff Policy

Unfortunately, circumstances may arise that require layoff. If the company, in its sole discretion, determines that a
layoff is necessary, affected associates will be notified of the effective date, pertinent benefits information, and
specified possibility of recall (if any) as soon as it is practical. All layoffs and recalls will be based upon company
needs and associate’s ability, as determined by the company. After 30 days on layoff status, associates will be
automatically terminated. Discipline

We reserve the right to discipline associates who violate company policies. We also reserve the right to suspend the
disciplinary process and to immediately proceed to discharge, as per our policy as an at-will employer. Alcohol & Controlled Substances

It is essential that all associates be alert and in full possession of their facilities when working to protect the safety of
our work force, work place, the public, as well as to promote high standards of conduct, integrity and efficiency. Being
under the influence of or being impaired by controlled substances such as, drugs or alcohol can cause permanent
injury/death. Accordingly, associates are prohibited from reporting to work in an unfit condition. This includes while under the
influence/impaired by alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances in their system. No associate may possess, sell or
distribute alcohol, drugs or controlled substances while on company property or company time. To prevent controlled substances, drugs, alcohol and other contraband from being brought onto the company premises,
the company may at its discretion, inspect any locker, package, purse, tool box, vehicle, or other personal belonging
brought onto the company premises in connection with the investigation of any rule violation or in the maintenance of
a safe workplace. Associates will cooperate in all investigations of suspected rule violations or workplace safety. Shoplifting

Customer, vendor and associate theft is a serious problem and must be handled by experienced personnel to avoid
difficulties. If you see anyone hiding merchandise in their clothing or in a packaging they are carrying, then quietly
report the incident to management. Try to do so without losing sight of the person involved. We want to be sure that
person does not dispose of the merchandise. When the manager arrives, state what the item is and where it was hidden. The manager will evaluate the situation."

 accomplice, if any. This can help the police. 3. Give the robbers what they ask for: Under no circumstances should you endanger your life or the lives of your
 fellow associates or customers. Do not attempt to apprehend the robber. Do not refuse to cooperate with their
 orders. Give them the money that is available, without argument. Money can be replaced. Your life or the lives of

In compliance with the Occupational Health & Safety Administration (OSHA) and Michigan OSHA (MIOSHA),
associates have a right to know of any hazardous chemicals/materials in the work place, and the risks associated with
those items. We have a “Material Safety Data Sheet” book (MSDS) that lists each hazardous chemical and explains
what to do if you are exposed to it. The MSDS book is located in the break room. You are also required to properly
label chemicals that you transfer from their original container to a smaller container (for example, to a mop bucket or
spray bottle.) If you are uncertain about the safety of any chemical/material, or how to properly label chemicals that
are transferred to small containers, then please see the department manager. If something is broken or malfunctioning
you must contact the department manager or a store director immediately. Injury Reporting
In case of injury on the job or occupational disease, the company pays workers compensation pursuant to state
regulations. Workers’ compensation helps cover doctor bills and provides your family with a continuing income
should you be temporarily or permanently disabled. You are required to promptly report to your manager any accident, injury or illness occurring while you are at work,
no matter how trivial you think it may be. This is essential. If you do not report an accident, injury, or illness, then you
may forfeit some or all of your state compensation benefits. Training

provided by the company. If a specific training workshop has films and you would like to review any of those training
films again at a later date, then please see your department manager to schedule a time. Page 25 of 38

Equipment & Tool Operation

1. Cleaning & Operation: Tools and equipment are to be kept clean and in good repair. Do not operate any equipment
 that in your opinion is not in a safe condition and/or that you have not been properly trained to operate. Any
 accident, hazard, unsafe working condition, or unsafe use of equipment is to be corrected or reported to your
 manager immediately for corrective action. 2. Accident Reporting: If you are involved in an accident while working or witness an accident by a customer or
 another associate, no matter how small, immediately report it to your Human Resources Representative or a
 manager. 3. Machine Guards & Operating Safety: We have machines in the building that have guards to prevent injury. Examples are deli meat slicers, carboard balers, and bakery equipment. Machines must not be operated until all
 guards are in place. Do not bypass or remove guards, unless for maintenance, cleaning or repair purposes. Safety
 laws require power lockout procedures to prevent the unexpected startup of power equipment while cleaning or
 servicing machines. This is known as “lock-out, tag out.” If a machine is tagged for repair or lock-out, do not
 attempt to operate it. If you do so, you will be discipline, up to and including discharge. 4. Fire Suppression Equipment & Exits: Fire extinguishers, inside and outside sprinkler system control valves,
 outside fire department connections and alarm bells, and all exits must be kept clear of obstructions at all times. If
 a fire extinguisher is discharged, even by accident, notify a store director immediately. Once a fire extinguisher is
 sprayed, it loses its pressure and won’t spray a second time. This is why you need to tell us, whenever at

Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy or under the company’s sick leave
policy are encouraged to speak with the Human Resources Department. The company may require an employee to
provide a doctor’s certification of serious health condition. If an employee takes a leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition or develops a condition that
is a serious health condition, the company may designate all or some portion of related sick leave taken as leave under
this policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications. Except in the case of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness, an eligible employee
can take up to 12 weeks of leave under this policy during any 12-month period. The company will measure the 12month period by a “rolling” 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee used any FMLA leave as
provided by the FMLA in its regulations. A husband and wife who are eligible for leave under this policy and are employed by the same covered employer are
permitted to take only a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken:

- For the birth of a child/to care for the child after birth
- For placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement
- To care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. Each time an employee takes leave the company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this
policy and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is
entitled to take at that time. Eligible employees can take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered
service member with a serious injury or illness. A single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of leave entitlement
described in this paragraph occurs using the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee’s first

for health insurance while the employee was on leave. Under current company policy, employees must make a
premium payment (their weekly payment) to Holiday Market at the same time as a payment that would be made if it
was a normal payroll deduction. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee’s health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of
leave. In the event that a payment is not received, the company will mail a notice of late payment to the employee 15
days before the date that coverage would be dropped, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specific date at least
15 days after the date of the letter. If the employee contributes to any other type of insurance/disability plan, the employer will continue to make payroll
deductions while the employee is on paid leave. While the employee is on unpaid leave, they must continue to make
those payments in the same manner prescribed in the paragraph above, along with health care payments. If the
employee does not continue these payments, the company may cancel coverage during the leave period, or will
recover the payments at the end of the leave period, in a manner consistent with the law. Employee Status After Leave

An employee who takes leave under this policy will be able to return to the same position when leave commenced, or
to an equivalent position as provided by the FMLA and its regulations. The equivalent position will have the same pay,
benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites, and status. Under certain circumstances the company may deny the employee to come back if:

 1. The employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested. 2. The employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee’s inability to attend a necessary
 course or renew a license as a result of the leave, despite being given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill those
 conditions upon return to work. 3. The employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the job due to a physical or mental condition,
 including the continuation of a serious health condition with or without a reasonable accommodation. 4. The employee is a “key employee” and the restoration of the employee would result in substantial and grievous
 economic injury to the company. The term “key employee” refers to any salary eligible employee who is
 among the highest paid 10% of all employees within 75 miles."

Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule

The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day
periodically when needed over a year,) or under certain circumstances may use the leave to reduce the work week or
work day, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 weeks over a 12month period. Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatments so as not to disrupt
the employer’s operations. The company may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and
benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule. For the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, the company and the employee must mutually agree to the schedule
before the employee may take the leave intermittently or work a reduced hour schedule. Leave for the birth, adoption,
or foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the birth or placement of the child. The company may require certification of the medical necessity."

request is made in the case of foreseeable leaves and within 5 business days after the leave commences in the case of
unforeseeable leaves. The employees should try to respond within 15 days of the request, or provide a reasonable

effort to schedule the treatment to minimize disruptions to the company’s operations. While on leave, employees are requested to report either very 2 weeks or every 30 days to the company, regarding the
status of the medical condition, and their intent to return to work. If the employee does not return at the end of the

Pension Benefits: Time spent on military leave (paid or unpaid) is not considered a break in employment for pension
benefit purposes. The returning service member who is eligible for reinstatement under USERRA has up to 3 times the
length of military leave (up to a max of 5 years) to make the retirement contribution payments he or she would have
made to establish retirement credit. USERRA does not permit double credit in two retirement systems for the same
military leave. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to purchase credit in company if he/she receives credit in any
other public retirement system, except federal social security system. Re-Employment Rights: USERRA places a 5-year limit (with some exceptions) on the cumulative length of time a
person may voluntarily serve in the military and remain eligible for re-employment rights. The USERRA
reinstatements rights do not extend, however, to employees who are employed for brief, non-recurrent periods with no
reasonable expectation that employment will continue indefinitely. Under certain circumstances employees that are
eligible to be reinstated to their former position unless company establishes that the circumstances have so changed as
to make re-employment impossible or unreasonable. If on military leave for 90 days or less, eligible employees may
be reinstated to their own position or a similar position of like seniority, status or pay. Upon return from military leave,
employees must comply with the current provisions of the law in regards to notification of and time frame in which
they must return to work. These limits are specified in 38 USC S4312 and vary depending on the length of service. COBRA Insurance

In certain situations, employees and their families are offered the opportunity for a temporary extension of health
coverage at group rates where coverage under their plan would otherwise end. If you’re an employee of the company
otherwise covered by the plan, you have a right to choose this continuation coverage if you lose your group health
coverage because of a reduction in your hours of employment, or the termination of your employment (for reasons
other than gross misconduct on your part.) If you choose to continue coverage, you will be required to pay a monthly
premium which will be indicated to you before you make your decision. Spouses/Children: If you are the spouse or child of an employee covered by the plan, you have the right to choose
continuation coverage for yourself if you lose group health coverage under the plan for any of the following 4 reasons:
a. The death of the spouse/parent, b. Termination of the spouse/parent’s employment (for reasons other than gross
misconduct) or reduction in the spouse/parent’s hours of employment, c. Divorce or legal separation, or d. Your
spouse/parent becomes eligible for Medicare. Qualifying Events: Each employee or family member has the responsibility to inform the plan administrator of a
divorce, legal separation, or a child losing dependent status under the plan within 60 days of the event or the date on
which coverage would be lost because of the event. The company has the responsibility to notify the plan
administrator of the covered worker’s death, termination, reduction in hours, or entitlement of Medicare. Length of Coverage: If you do not choose continuation coverage, your group health insurance coverage will end. If
you choose continuation coverage, the company is required to give you coverage which, as of the time coverage being
provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family
members. The law requires that you afforded the opportunity to maintain continuation coverage for 36 months unless
you lost group health coverage because of a termination of employment, or reduction in hours. In that case, the
required continuation coverage period is 18 months."

time during the first 60 days of continuation coverage following termination or reduction in hours, the continuation

administrator of the covered worker’s death, termination, reduction in hours, or entitlement of Medicare. Length of Coverage: If you do not choose continuation coverage, your group health insurance coverage will end. If
you choose continuation coverage, the company is required to give you coverage which, as of the time coverage being
provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family

members. The law requires that you afforded the opportunity to maintain continuation coverage for 36 months unless
you lost group health coverage because of a termination of employment, or reduction in hours. In that case, the
required continuation coverage period is 18 months. If you become disabled as defined by the social security act at any
time during the first 60 days of continuation coverage following termination or reduction in hours, the continuation
coverage period is 29 months."

extended coverage period, whether or not they are disabled. Moreover, continuation coverage may be extended from
18 months to 36 months for those individuals who were qualified beneficiaries under the group health plan at the time
of the original qualifying event, where a second qualifying event (death or divorce etc..) occurs during the original
18month period. Page 35 of 38

An individual who receives the extended coverage period due to a disability must notify the plan administrator when it
is determined that the individual is no longer disabled within the definitions of the social security ace. The law also states that your continuation coverage (18, 29, 36 months) may be cut short for any of the below reasons:
 1. If the company no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees
 2. If the premium for your continuation coverage is not paid
 3. If you become covered under another group health plan which covers your pre-existing condition
 4. If you become eligible for Medicare
 5. If you were divorced from a covered employee and subsequently remarry and are covered under your new
 spouse’s group health plan. 6. If there is a final determination that you are no longer disabled (in the case of beneficiaries who qualified for an
 extra 11 months of continuation coverage based upon their disability.)

You do not have to show that you are insurable to choose continuation coverage. However, you may have to pay all or
a part of the premium for your continuation coverage. This notice is provided as a matter of information only. It does not, and is not intended to create any contractual, legal
or other rights. Rather, your rights are only as expressly set forth in the plan and in federal/state law. The company
reserves the right to amend and/or change the plan as permitted by the terms of the plan. In addition, a subsequent
qualifying event and initial qualifying event can extend the period of coverage for qualified beneficiaries. For further information about this law, contact your human resources representative. Worker’s Compensation Insurance

In case of injury on the job or occupation disease, Holiday Market pays Workers’ Compensation pursuant to state

An Introduction
This handbook is provided to each employee as a guide to the Company’s policies and procedures. It is
not intended to create, and should not be construed as creating, a contract between the Company and
any one or all of its employees. All employees are employed on an at-will basis. At-will employment
means that either the Company or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any
time, with or without prior notice, for any reason not otherwise prohibited by law. Any representation
to the contrary is not binding on the Company unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized
representative of the Company. Please read this handbook carefully. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and
outlines the programs developed by the Company for your benefit. One of our primary objectives for
our employees is to create an environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth. We believe you will find an abundance of resources in this handbook that will help you achieve your
personal and professional goals. Our employee handbook cannot possibly anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise, and
it should not be considered as the only or final source of information. It does replace all prior handbooks
and related publications previously distributed. As questions arise, we ask that you consult with your
manager or a human resources representative for further information about a policy, guideline, or any
other information regarding your employment that may or may not be contained in this publication. As we continue to grow, and as our business environment continues to change, there may be a need to
change the policies, guidelines, and benefits described in this handbook. As such, we reserve the right to
revise, amend, modify, add to, rescind or terminate these policies, guidelines, and benefits at any time
and in any manner that we deem appropriate to serve the needs and interests of the Company and its

Respect means honoring all the diversity in our work environment and includes coworkers, customers,
vendors, and our communities. It means consideration of others’ feelings, concerns and ideas. “People with humility don’t think less of themselves, they just think about themselves less.”

 “Sometimes when the numbers look right the decision is still wrong.”

Innovation means continually striving to improve our processes, our products, and our quality, and
helping our coworkers do their job better. “Managing only for profit is like trying to play tennis with your eye on the scoreboard and not on
 the ball.”

OUR HISTORY
Both Lunds and Byerlys have a rich history, beginning as Minnesota companies founded by local families. Lunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove’s, a local supermarket back
in 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store
on Lake Street in Minneapolis. Don Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden
Valley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single
Company in 1997. The new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is
owned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr.

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued
prosperity for the 21st century and beyond. MEDIA PHILOSOPHY
It is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or
other public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we
speak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a
Company-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your
location manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding
the media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office. III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
Our Company recognizes and values the benefits of diversity in people, ideas and cultures. Accordingly,
our Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment
free from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a
policy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender,
age, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with
regard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law. Page 6 of 42

This commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including
selection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,
and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all
classifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment. If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or
process that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your
department manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources. You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal
employment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your
complaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be
engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES
Our Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting
discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any
qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such
individual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential
functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a
qualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us
aware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her
position. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue
hardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate
disclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the
confidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information
is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at
management’s discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the
essential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This
policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions

complaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be
engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES

Our Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting
discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any
qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such
individual's disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential
functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a
qualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us
aware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her
position. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue
hardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate
disclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the
confidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information
is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at
management's discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the
essential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This
policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions
necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE

Our Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are

may be potentially offensive or inappropriate particularly from a race and/or religious basis. This
includes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or
classes of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might
be displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by
reporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It
also includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory
and reporting such to your manager to take action to correct the situation. The key message is: Be proactive and address issues by reporting them to your manager as you see
them occur. We all are responsible for providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and

deemed necessary by the Company to ensure that the harassment and/or offensive behavior stops. All
complaints of this nature will be kept confidential with information being disclosed to only those
persons who have a legitimate need to know. All managers must notify the human resources department of any harassment complaints that they

that appropriate and timely action is taken to investigate harassment complaints and respond with
actions that effectively resolve the situation and prevent recurrence of the behavior. False and malicious complains of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as opposed to complaints
that, even if erroneous, are made in good faith) may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL
All employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an
employment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment
relationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you

integrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of
conduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the
safety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive
discipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all

As a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely
committed to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a
considerate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe
you are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to
treat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be
tolerated. Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift
When you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are
expected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption
caused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in
advance of your shift as possible. Failure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is
inexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action. If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your
supervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment. Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or

Taking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is
forbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be
consumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be
visible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and
prosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible. Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not
worked is considered theft and could cost you your job. Working off the clock
We value the work that you do and it’s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you
perform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to
accurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools
accurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be
tolerated and could cost you your job. Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants
You may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including
inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the
job. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee
allowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,
including inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants. We encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or
alcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees
who violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for
assistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked
to submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of
alcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment."

who violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for
assistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked
to submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of
alcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Any such test will be at the Company’s expense and by a physician and/or
testing facility selected by the Company and in full compliance with state and federal law. If you are under a physician’s guidance and are taking prescription drugs or other medication which may
affect your ability to work safely, you should not perform your job duties if doing so will pose a threat to
your own safety or the safety of others. You must review this with your manager. Fighting, threatening or violent behavior

physical threats or threatening behavior or other behavior intended to cause or causing apprehension

regulations wherever they do business. Employees may not use a consultant, broker or other third party

failure to comply with these regulations. Note that our registers are programmed for ages and age
calendars are at each service counter. Non-solicitation
Solicitation, posting or distribution of material, handbills, printed or written literature of any kind,
including internet or phone communications, by an employee to another employee is prohibited during
working time and in all employee working areas. Working time does not include non-work time such as ,

HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME, AND EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS
Hours of work, overtime, and employment classifications are explained in detail in the LFHI non-union
benefits summary or your applicable union contract. Note that for overtime purposes, the work week is
defined as Monday through Sunday, or as noted per your Union contract. Questions regarding hours of
work, overtime, and employment classifications should be directed to your location manager or the
human resource department. JOB DESCRIPTIONS
Job descriptions are available for many positions. They contain valuable information about a position’s
purpose, essential functions and primary responsibilities. Ask your manager for a copy of the job
description for your position. As your position changes and evolves, be sure to note those changes on
the job description and advise your manager so revisions can be made. WORK SCHEDULES
In most retail and production facilities the work schedules will be posted in advance. If you would like to
request a change in your work schedule, you will need to notify your manager one week prior to the
posting of the new schedule. Complete consideration will be given to all scheduling requests in
conjunction with consideration for the needs of the business. Work schedules for office positions will be communicated to you by your manager. These work
schedules generally remain consistent from week to week. If you would like to change your work
schedule, please discuss it with your manager as early as possible. Your request will receive
consideration along with consideration for the coverage and production needs of the department. BREAK PERIODS
The Company provides all employees with the opportunity to enjoy paid break periods and unpaid break
periods. Since we have employees who work a variety of shifts, both full and part-time, specific break
assignments will be communicated to you by your manager. To avoid service interruptions, it is
important for everyone to closely adhere to their scheduled break periods. TIME CLOCK USE
If you are in a position that is paid by the hour, you will be asked to record your time by using a time
clock or other timekeeping device. All hours worked must be recorded on the time clock or timekeeping
device; working off the clock is not allowed. It is important that you clock in slightly prior to the start of
your shift so you are ready to work at your scheduled start time. Advance approval from your manager
is required if you plan on working hours other than those that have been scheduled for you. To assure that there is no interruption in customer service, we ask that you do not leave your work area
to clock out until the time that your scheduled shift ends. If you work in a retail or production facility
where continuing operations are essential, please do not leave your work area unattended if there is no
one to relieve you; rather, call a manager for assistance. It is important that you follow accurate
timekeeping procedures for starting and ending times as well as paid rest breaks and unpaid breaks. Your manager will explain this process in greater detail. Your time record indicates what you believe to be an accurate account of the schedule and hours that
you have worked in a given pay period. Misrepresenting your hours in any way, falsifying your time

posting of the new schedule. Complete consideration will be given to all scheduling requests in
conjunction with consideration for the needs of the business. Work schedules for office positions will be communicated to you by your manager."
Retail,General Business,handbook,Lunds Byerlys,REST,your|that|work|will|manager,2025-11-14T22:06:37.691375,1014,"Complete consideration will be given to all scheduling requests in
conjunction with consideration for the needs of the business. Work schedules for office positions will be communicated to you by your manager. These work
schedules generally remain consistent from week to week. If you would like to change your work
schedule, please discuss it with your manager as early as possible. Your request will receive
consideration along with consideration for the coverage and production needs of the department. BREAK PERIODS

The Company provides all employees with the opportunity to enjoy paid break periods and unpaid break
periods. Since we have employees who work a variety of shifts, both full and part-time, specific break
assignments will be communicated to you by your manager. To avoid service interruptions, it is
important for everyone to closely adhere to their scheduled break periods. TIME CLOCK USE

If you are in a position that is paid by the hour, you will be asked to record your time by using a time
clock or other timekeeping device. All hours worked must be recorded on the time clock or timekeeping
device; working off the clock is not allowed. It is important that you clock in slightly prior to the start of
your shift so you are ready to work at your scheduled start time. Advance approval from your manager
is required if you plan on working hours other than those that have been scheduled for you. To assure that there is no interruption in customer service, we ask that you do not leave your work area
to clock out until the time that your scheduled shift ends. If you work in a retail or production facility
where continuing operations are essential, please do not leave your work area unattended if there is no
one to relieve you; rather, call a manager for assistance. It is important that you follow accurate
timekeeping procedures for starting and ending times as well as paid rest breaks and unpaid breaks. Your manager will explain this process in greater detail. Your time record indicates what you believe to be an accurate account of the schedule and hours that
you have worked in a given pay period. Misrepresenting your hours in any way, falsifying your time

record, allowing someone else to clock in or out for you, or clocking in or out for someone else is strictly
prohibited and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. If you
have any questions about timekeeping, please discuss them with your department manager or location
manager. COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
We are committed to providing a wage level that is equal to or greater than the prevailing wage rate in
the community for similar jobs. As part of that commitment, we are constantly evaluating wage levels
for all positions and comparing them to prevailing wages in our community. All positions have assigned
wage ranges either through union contracts or our LFHI compensation program. Questions concerning
wage levels can be brought to your location manager or the human resource department. PAYMENT OF WAGES
Our payroll department creates several thousand paychecks each pay cycle. To accomplish this
important responsibility, they must have accurate and complete pay record information from every
employee. If you have an address change, name change, marital status change, change in withholdings
or any other change that would affect your paycheck, please update your information within the MyLFHI
website. If you receive a paycheck that is inaccurate, return it to your manager so the error can be
corrected and a new check issued. PAYDAY
We are paid every two weeks on Friday for the work performed in the preceding two weeks. The longest
period of time that a new employee would wait for a paycheck would be three weeks. This would occur
if you started during the second week of a pay-period. In that case you would work the week you started
and the next two weeks. The check that you receive at the end of your third week would represent
wages for the time worked during the preceding two weeks. DIRECT DEPOSIT
We offer a direct deposit service to our employees. This enables you to have your pay automatically
deposited. On payday, you will receive an earnings statement within the MyLFHI site which itemizes
your gross pay, deductions and withholdings and lists your net pay. Instead of receiving a check, the
money will already be in your designated account on the date of the payday, available for your use at
the start of business on payday morning. Contact your manager or location manager for more
information about this service. NO TIPPING
Though our customers are generous and can be persistent in wanting to give a monetary tip, the
Company has a strict no tipping practices for all positions except restaurant servers and catering
employees. It is expected you would politely and respectfully decline and remind our customers that,

calendar days in advance, or as soon as is practical. During an FML, the Company continues to pay the employer’s portion of your medical, dental and life
insurance benefits. Retirement contributions are suspended during an FML, as are all other benefits
such as vacation, PTO and holidays. Your union contract or the LFHI non-union benefits summary will
provide further information regarding the impact of FML on vacation, holidays, personal holidays, and
PTO benefits. In addition, you will be able to substitute earned paid leave during the unpaid portion of
your FML leave. The Hartford will require a physician’s statement certifying the reason for the FML request and may
require periodic updates throughout the leave period. The Hartford may require recertification on a
reasonable basis in compliance with the law. If The Hartford has reason to doubt the validity of the

may allow this, but you must have prior approval from both your supervisor or manager and human
resources. If you engage in other work or employment during your leave without prior approval from
your supervisor or manager and human resources, you will be considered to have violated the terms of
your leave and to have voluntarily terminated your employment. Employees who elect not to return to work upon expiration of their FML will be required to reimburse
the Company for employer-paid benefit contributions, and their employment will be terminated as of
the date of FML expiration unless the employee is on an approved medical or personal leave. For more
information, please contact your location manager or human resource representative. MEDICAL LEAVE
A medical leave of absence will be granted to employees who are restricted from working due to a
disabling illness or injury upon receipt of sufficient information from a medical provider that verifies the
disabling condition and the need for medical leave. The length of leave will be governed by medical
necessity as determined by a physician’s certification. The employee may be asked to provide periodic
medical status reports referencing his/her current work restrictions and the Company may require the
employee to return to work if work within the employee’s restrictions is available. Insurance and retirement programs are suspended during a medical leave of absence except for periods
of medical leave that are also covered by FML, whereby the employer’s portion of medical, dental and
life insurance premiums will continue to be paid. When FML is not available, the opportunity to continue
insurance coverage will be made available at the employee’s cost in accordance with the terms and
conditions of COBRA. Page 23 of 42

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook

An employee is required to provide the Company and The Hartford with notice of the need for FML 30
calendar days in advance, or as soon as is practical. During an FML, the Company continues to pay the employer’s portion of your medical, dental and life
insurance benefits. Retirement contributions are suspended during an FML, as are all other benefits
such as vacation, PTO and holidays. Your union contract or the LFHI non-union benefits summary will
provide further information regarding the impact of FML on vacation, holidays, personal holidays, and
PTO benefits. In addition, you will be able to substitute earned paid leave during the unpaid portion of
your FML leave. The Hartford will require a physician’s statement certifying the reason for the FML request and may
require periodic updates throughout the leave period. The Hartford may require recertification on a
reasonable basis in compliance with the law. If The Hartford has reason to doubt the validity of the
certification, it may require, at the Company’s expense, that a second opinion be obtained from a health
care provider of its choosing. If the second opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification,
then The Hartford may require, at the Company’s expense, that you obtain the opinion of a third health
care provider designated or approved jointly by you and the Company. The opinion of the third health
care provider shall be final and binding. At the end of your FML, the Company will restore you to the position you held before your leave started
or to an equivalent position, except as provided under applicable law. In addition, while you are on FML,
The Hartford and the Company may require you to periodically report on your status and intention to
return to work. Typically, when you are on FML, you may not engage in other work or employment. In rare cases we
may allow this, but you must have prior approval from both your supervisor or manager and human
resources. If you engage in other work or employment during your leave without prior approval from
your supervisor or manager and human resources, you will be considered to have violated the terms of
your leave and to have voluntarily terminated your employment."

TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF AND TAKING CARE OF OTHERS
Let’s face it, we seldom think about the possibility of sustaining a disabling injury while at work. But all it
takes is one little misstep, miscalculation or mistake and your life or another’s can be forever changed. The things that matter most - your health, your family, play time and work - can all be compromised
in an instant. Your personal safety cannot be taken for granted - it’s something that you need to work
at and we hope you will. The information that follows represents our guidelines to help ensure your personal safety and the
safety of others. Please take the time to read this information and discuss any questions with your manager or safety
representative. Did You Know?  Regardless of our job titles, we all have the same three job responsibilities:
 1) Keep the environment safe and clean. 2) Create sensational service for our customers. 3) Do the job you were hired to do. Did You Know?  You can help prevent accidents by correcting a hazard when you see one or telling your
 manager about it? SAFETY RESOURCES
Reporting Injuries - If you’re injured on or off the job, let your manager know right away. If your injury
is work-related, he or she will want to help you and take care of any hazards. Your manager will ask you
to participate in an accident investigation to help us prevent similar incidents. He or she will also
complete paperwork to investigate and document the injury. If you need medical care, you’ll be referred to the designated clinic and be asked to bring back a returnto-work form from the physician. If you have physical restrictions that limit the type of work you can do, your manager may assign you to
a Temporary Alternate Duty (TAD) job until you’re able to return to your regular assignment. This allows
you to continue working during your recovery. Finally, if you’ve missed time, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Once again, your
manager will help you with this process. Safety Committee - The safety committee’s role is to help make your workplace safe and prevent

Age-Restricted Products - There are special laws designed to limit youth access to age-restricted
products such as alcohol. Our Company strongly supports these guidelines. If your job involves the sale
of these products, you’ll participate in training that covers guidelines you need to follow. For example, we require our customers to present identification to verify that they are at least 21 years
old to purchase alcohol. The cashier or server must verify that the customer is of legal age to purchase
these products. Not following these guidelines can be expensive for you and the Company. You can be subject to costly
fines and legal fees and the Company could be fined and lose its license to sell these products. If you
have any questions about this information, please ask your manager for assistance. Did You Know?  Your personal safety and the safety of others is far more important than any amount of

  Never place sharp objects or knives in soapy water

 Did You Know?  It’s everyone’s responsibility - from the president to the deli clerk to the cleaning staff - to
 make sure the food we sell is safe and wholesome for our customers. Working with Chemicals - Chemicals, when used properly and safely, pose no harmful effects. But when
spilled or used without caution, they can present a possible hazard to you and others in the work area. You have the right to know about any chemical you encounter in the workplace. To learn about and
work safely with chemicals, refer to and follow guidelines on the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), listed
alphabetically and located in the Safety Center. You may receive a copy of a SDS by asking for one. If we
do not have a SDS for a product, we’ll request one from the supplier. Labels and SDS - These provide you with important information to keep you and others safe. Take the
time to carefully read chemical labels and MSDS before you handle a chemical. The Safety Data Sheets will tell you everything you need to know about a chemical, including if you need
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). It will also tell you about a chemical’s reactivity level or if the
chemical is stable. For example, if you mix household ammonia and bleach together, deadly chlorine gas
is produced. Never mix chemicals together that are not designed for mixing. If you find a container that
is not labeled, don’t use it and never smell it to determine its identity. Questions about a chemical? Ask
your manager. Personal Protective Equipment - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is designed to keep you safe
while working with chemicals or equipment, or during other work activities. Examples of PPE include eye
goggles, gloves and boots. Questions about PPE? Ask your manager where PPE can be found in your
department. Body Fluids - Cleaning a restroom, cleaning up when someone has been sick, or helping bandage a cut
are activities that require you to take precautions. For your personal safety, always wear gloves and other protective gear to ensure that you do not come
in contact with any type of body fluid. Bodily fluids such as blood, vomit, urine and feces are all
contaminates that may expose you to communicable diseases. Wash thoroughly before and after removing gloves and engaging in these activities. If you come in
contact with bodily fluids, report it to your manager. Working with Pallet Jacks and Forklift Trucks - The use of pallet jacks and forklift trucks is limited to
employees who have been trained and certified to use this equipment. Ask your manager about training

Stretching and Mini-Breaks - Stretching increases flexibility and helps to promote circulation and range
of motion while decreasing muscle stiffness and fatigue. When you do stretches, you ultimately
decrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static
stretching - which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-30
seconds - is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as “warm-ups”
to those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:

  Head/Neck Roll - Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling. Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times.  Shoulder Shrugs - Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles-up, forward,
 down and backward. Repeat 3-5 times.  Elbow Press for Middle Back - Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly
 backward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times.  Back Extension - Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for
 support. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times.  Leg Stretches - While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the
 same with your left leg."

Repeat 3-5 times. Caution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them. Did You Know?  The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe
 lifting techniques. Keeping Your Back Injury-Free - Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from
injury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items. Use these safe lifting
techniques:
  Stretch
  Lift safely
  Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like Shoes For Crews®
 - ask your manager about them.  Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs.  Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting.  Know your limits - don’t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for
 help; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips. Regular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise
program, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises. Page 40 of 42
