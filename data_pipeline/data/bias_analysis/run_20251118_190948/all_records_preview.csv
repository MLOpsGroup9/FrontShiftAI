PERFORMANCE

PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING POLICY
ALL EMPLOYEES

SCOPE

All employees
PURPOSE

To provide clear expectations, counseling, and evaluative feedback to employees concerning performance results. PHILOSOPHY

Effective performance depends significantly on effective two-way communication between management and employee. This
communication should include a clear understanding of expectations for work results, periodic reviews of progress towards these
results, and counseling, re-training or assistance when necessary. MAJOR ACTIVITIES IN PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REVIEW
There are three major activities in the Performance Management and Review Process. 1. A Valid Job Description
 The fundamental component of the performance is the job description. This document identifies the skills,
 competencies, experiences and training details suggested and/or required for a particular job. It is in the best interest
 of both the employee and the company to ensure a current (not less than 3 years old) job description exists. Management and employee should review the job description upon being hired and review at regular interval to
 ensure a high level of accuracy exists and desired results are being accomplished. 2. Performance Evaluation Process
 The client evaluates the employee job performance on a regular (weekly or monthly) basis using the Customer Quality Card
 provided by the company. As stated on the card, a code or rating of 3 or below is unacceptable. With such rating, the employee
 will undergo additional training and if deemed necessary, terminated. 3. Development Opportunities. The Company will provide periodic skills training to the employees for the purpose of continuous development and on-going
 growth, based on the organizations mission and values. TRAINING:

POLICY
It is the policy of the Company to provide initial on-the-job training and ongoing development opportunities to employees, to ensure
that all employees continually grow in their work-related skills and abilities. It is the policy of the Company to provide both
documented and face-to-face feedback to employees on their skills on a periodic basis. PHILOSOPHY
Company success depends largely on the productivity and performance of each employee. In order to be productive, each employee
needs to develop the skills necessary for effective work performance. There may become a time when a need for improvement may be discussed with an employee, in which a “retraining” plan for improvement will be developed. PERFORMANCE

The U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division administers the Act which basically
states that an employee polygraph examination may be requested by an employer in
connection with an ongoing internal investigation relating to a definable economic loss to the
firm. The Employer is responsible for the completion of preliminary administrative
requirements before the test is administered and after a polygraph examination is requested
from an employee. The Employer must support the employee’s notice of a request to participate in a polygraph
examination with documented information. The notice will verify that the eligibility for the
polygraph examination exits. This is done through the following three requirements:

 1. That the employee had access. 2. That there was a definite, recognized economic or material loss. 3. That there is reason to suspect that the employee in question may have been
 involved. In the event the employee fails the polygraph test, the employee will be responsible for
reimbursing the polygraph fee by means of payroll deduction of separate reimbursement. 6.3 Disciplinary action

The Company takes disciplinary matters very seriously, and will exact discipline, as it sees fit, for any
unacceptable action or behavior. These may include
*Excessive lateness and/or absence
*Improper or indecent conduct
*Poor communication
*Uncooperative attitude

*Abuse, per functionary are on authorize use, or on authorized possession of company property
*Un-authorized used or disclosure of company information
*Possession and or use of illegal drugs, weapons or explosives
*Illegal harassment and or discrimination
*Violation of company policy

Disciplinary action may consist of anything from verbal /written warnings and counseling to demotion,
transfers, suspension or termination. Rather than follow rote procedures, the company will handle each
matter individually to ensure fairness to all involved. Please review and internalize the list of “don’ts”
about then make an effort to use good judgment at all time. Polygraph Examinations

specific duration, nor does the Handbook obligate you to continue your employment for a specific
period of time. Unless you have entered into a written employment agreement that supersedes this
document, either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The Handbook does not guarantee any prescribed process for discipline and discharge. No manager or other representative of the Company, other than the President, has the authority to
enter into any agreement guaranteeing employment for any specific period. No such agreement
shall be enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the President and the employee. Recruitment and Hiring

Overtime Hours

Employees shall be paid for their hours worked in accordance with all legal requirements. Employees who qualify as administrative, executive, or professional employees within the
meaning of the state and federal wage and hour laws are exempt from overtime pay and are not
subject to this policy. Because of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the
Company requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible. Overtime hours by a non-exempt employee must be approved in advance by an employee’s
supervisor. Because unauthorized overtime is against company policy, employees who work
unauthorized overtime are subject to discipline, possibly including termination. Sick time and
holiday hours paid but not worked are not included in calculating overtime. Overtime is based only
on actual hours worked as required by law. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate for all hours over
eight hours in one workday or 40 hours in one workweek. Overtime is computed on the basis of a
non-exempt employee’s total hours worked in a workday and a workweek. Hours paid for that are
not worked (e.g. sick days) do not count as hours worked for overtime purposes. Overtime hours in excess of twelve in one workday are paid at double-time for non-exempt
employees. Hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a week are calculated at one and onehalf times the non-exempt employee’s regular rate. Hours worked performed over eight hours on
the seventh consecutive day of work also are paid at the non-exempt employee’s double time rate. California Meal and Rest Period Policy

Kinyon Construction complies with federal and state legal requirements concerning meal and rest
periods. The Company recognizes that employees perform at their best when they have the rest and
nourishment they need. This policy explains when the Company expects employees to take meal
and rest periods. Any employee, supervisor, or manager who fails to observe meal and rest period policies will be
subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this policy
should be reported to any supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Every report will be
fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report
alleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the Company’s investigation of such reports. Any form of retaliation in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination. Overtime Hours

Attendance and Punctuality

It is important for you to report to work on time and to avoid unnecessary absences. The Company recognizes that illness or other circumstances beyond your control may cause you
to be absent from work from time to time. However, frequent absenteeism or tardiness may result
in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Excessive absenteeism or frequent tardiness
puts an unnecessary strain on your co-workers and can have a negative impact on the success of
the Company. You are expected to report to work when scheduled. Whenever you know in advance that you are
going to be absent, you should notify your immediate supervisor or the designated manager. If
your absence is unexpected, you should attempt to reach your immediate supervisor as soon as
possible, but in no event later than one hour before you are due at work. In the event your
immediate supervisor is unavailable, you must speak with a manager. If you must leave a
voicemail, you must provide a number where your supervisor may reach you if need be."

Kinyon Construction is open for business unless there is a government-declared state of emergency
or unless you are advised otherwise by your supervisor. There may be times when we will delay
opening, and on rare occasions, we may have to close. Use common sense and your best judgment

employees will be paid for the day. If the Company’s facilities are open and you are delayed getting
to work or cannot get to work at all because of inclement weather, the absence will be charged to
(1) personal days or (2) unpaid time off, in that order. You should always use your judgment about
your own safety in getting to work. When severe weather develops or is anticipated to develop during the day and a decision is made
by the Company to close before 5:00 pm, you will be compensated as if you had worked to the
end of your regularly scheduled hours for that day. If you elect to leave prior to the time

possession of drugs or alcohol. There are two components to this policy. The first involves a
general prohibition against conduct that is detrimental to the objectives of the policy and the
interests of the Company and its employees. The second involves methods of detecting
inappropriate drug or alcohol use, including the testing of job applicants and employees for
substance abuse. 1. General Rules

Employee involvement with alcohol or drugs can be extremely disruptive and harmful to the work
place. It can adversely affect the quality of work and the performance of employees, pose serious
safety and health risks to the user and others, and have a negative impact on work efficiency and
productivity. Accordingly, the Company requires all employees to report for work fit to perform
their duties and prohibits the use or possession of alcohol or illegal drugs. All employees must
adhere to the rules stated in this policy. The use, possession, distribution, transfer or sale of illegal drugs or alcohol, or being under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on the Company's premises
or while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment owned or leased by the Company. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and possibly including
immediate discharge. Any employee who is under the influence of any prescribed medication must advise his supervisor
of that fact, and the precise type of medication involved, before reporting to work. 2. Pre-employment Testing

All job applicants applying for employment with the Company must submit to and pass a drug
screening test. All offers of employment are conditioned upon the successful completion of the
testing procedure. 3. Reasonable Suspicion Testing

In cases when an employee's supervisor or other Company superior has reasonable suspicion to
believe that the employee possesses or is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol and such use

general prohibition against conduct that is detrimental to the objectives of the policy and the
interests of the Company and its employees. The second involves methods of detecting
inappropriate drug or alcohol use, including the testing of job applicants and employees for
substance abuse. 1. General Rules

Employee involvement with alcohol or drugs can be extremely disruptive and harmful to the work
place. It can adversely affect the quality of work and the performance of employees, pose serious
safety and health risks to the user and others, and have a negative impact on work efficiency and
productivity. Accordingly, the Company requires all employees to report for work fit to perform
their duties and prohibits the use or possession of alcohol or illegal drugs. All employees must
adhere to the rules stated in this policy. The use, possession, distribution, transfer or sale of illegal drugs or alcohol, or being under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on the Company's premises
or while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment owned or leased by the Company. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and possibly including
immediate discharge. Any employee who is under the influence of any prescribed medication must advise his supervisor
of that fact, and the precise type of medication involved, before reporting to work. 2. Pre-employment Testing

All job applicants applying for employment with the Company must submit to and pass a drug
screening test. All offers of employment are conditioned upon the successful completion of the
testing procedure. 3. Reasonable Suspicion Testing

In cases when an employee's supervisor or other Company superior has reasonable suspicion to
believe that the employee possesses or is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol and such use
or influence may adversely affect the employee's job performance, or the safety of the employee
or co-workers, alcohol and/or drug screening may be ordered. This suspicion must be based on
any objective symptoms, such as factors related to the employee's appearance, behavior, speech
and/or other facts. If an employee is on medically-prescribed medication, it is the employee's
responsibility to advise his supervisor of this fact before he reports to work. Testing may also be required if an employee is found to be in possession of physical evidence, i.e.,

Parking Reimbursement

Employees may be reimbursed for business-related parking expenses up to the established
maximum rate of $25. Public Transit Reimbursement

in the direct performance of an employee’s duties other than commuting to and from work. Rental Cars

Automobile rentals should be limited to situations where other means of transportation are not
practical, economical, or available. Travelers are encouraged to choose compact or mid-sized cars
whenever possible. If you need more information regarding rental cars, contact your immediate
supervisor, designated manager, or the Human Resources Department. Note: Travelers should refill gas tanks before returning the vehicles. Rental companies levy a
charge for refueling, far more than the price of gas. Avoid drop charges by returning the vehicle
to the renting location. Compare the cost of air travel versus driving and drop charges. Air Travel

Air travel expense is reimbursed on the basis of the actual cost incurred by the traveler using
normally traveled routes. Be sure to make reservations in advance, as most discounted fares are
available when purchased several days prior to departure. Be flexible in selection of airlines and
flight time. Accommodations

Travelers are strongly encouraged to use standard accommodations at reasonably priced midmarket hotels or motels. Before booking anything, please check with office staff so the appropriate
personnel may be aware and assist if needed. Meal Expenses

Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable and actual expenses for meals incurred during
business related travel. The Company will generally reimburse travelers for three meals a day. All
original receipts must be included with the employee’s travel and expense report. Any employee

Religious Observance

Federal and state equal opportunity laws generally require employers to accommodate the religious
beliefs of employees, but do not require them to provide paid leave. The Company respects your
religious beliefs; therefore, employees who require time off may use personal days. This leave
must be requested through the department manager two weeks prior to the event, and may be
declined, only if causing the Company undue hardship. Procedure

Requests for time off should be submitted to your supervisor as soon as you know when you wish
to schedule your time off, but in no event less than two weeks prior to the time requested. Time
off requests are approved by your immediate supervisor. This is coordinated so that sufficient staff
is available to provide adequate coverage at all times, and there may be Company-wide or
department-specific “blackout dates,” as necessary. Time off requests are granted on a first-come,
first-served basis. In the event of a conflict in requests, your supervisor will consider the
Company’s staffing needs during the relevant period, as well as the length of service with the
Company of the employees involved. Personal/Sick Leave

Employees who reach the applicable cap will cease to accrue further paid sick leave hours until
paid sick leave is used, at which point the employee will continue to accrue additional paid sick
leave up to the cap. Paid sick leave not used in a year otherwise carries over from year to year. C. Leave Usage

Employees may take the greater of 24 hours or three regularly-scheduled workdays’ worth of paid
sick leave per leave year for any of the qualifying reasons discussed below, as well as any reasons
allowed for under an applicable local paid sick leave ordinance. For the purposes of this policy,
the leave year is the employee’s anniversary year. Paid sick leave may be used for the diagnosis, care (including preventive care), or treatment of an
existing health condition of an employee and certain family members of the employee. A family member includes a child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or
sibling. For purposes of this policy, a “child” means a biological or adopted child, a foster child, a
step-child, a legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis (in the place of a
parent). Similarly, a “parent” under this policy means a biological or adoptive parent, a foster
parent, a step-parent, an employee’s legal guardian, a legal guardian of an employee’s spouse or
domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. Employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking also may use paid
sick leave for treatment, assistance, and other purposes authorized by law. Employees using paid sick leave must do so in minimum increments of two hours. Employees will
be paid for sick leave not later than the payday for the next regular payroll period after the sick
leave was taken. Finally, an employee will not be required to search for or find a replacement if
the employee is taking paid sick leave under this policy. D. Compensation for Sick Leave

Paid sick days ordinarily are paid at the employee’s normal rate of pay earned during regular work
hours. Accrued, unused paid sick leave is not paid out upon termination or resignation. However,
employees separating from employment who are rehired within one year from the date of
separation will have their previously accrued and unused paid sick days reinstated. The employee
also will begin accruing paid sick leave upon re-hire (assuming the employee’s bank is below the
applicable cap). In addition, if the employee is re-hired within one year from the date of separation,
any number of days that the employee previously worked for the Company will be credited toward
the 90 calendar days that an employee must have worked for the Company before being eligible
to use paid sick leave under this policy. E. Approval

employee must provide reasonable advance notice. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee

must provide notice of the leave as soon as practical. When requesting sick leave, employees
should not disclose any private medical information or any other confidential personal information. F. Non-Retaliation or Discrimination

The Company strictly prohibits any form of retaliation or discrimination against an employee for
attempting to use or using paid sick leave under this policy, and for any other reason prohibited by
applicable law. Notification Procedures

When you are absent from work and your absence has not been previously scheduled, you must
personally notify your immediate supervisor or manager as soon as you are aware that you will be
late or unable to report to work. Leaving a voicemail or message with another staff member does
not qualify as notifying your supervisor. When absence is due to illness, the Company reserves the right to require appropriate medical
documentation. Such documentation need only include the employee’s name, the date and time
the employee was seen, and if applicable, a specific instruction regarding the employee’s
incapacity to perform his or her job. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness can result in discipline,
up to and including discharge. (Also see the section on Family & Medical Leave for extended
leave situations.)

If you are absent because of an accident or you are absent for longer than seven (7) days due to
illness, compensation is paid under the benefits of the Company’s short-term disability plan,
provided you are eligible for and participate in that plan. Military Service Leave

Employees serving in the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,
Coast Guard and Public Health Service commissioned corps, as well as the reserve components of
each of these services, may take unpaid military leave, as needed, to enable them to fulfill their
obligations as service members. Service members must provide advance written or verbal notice
to the Company for all military duty, unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded
by military necessity. Employees should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under
the circumstances. In addition, employees may, but are not required to, use accrued personal days
while performing military duty. Family and Medical Leave

The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows certain employees to take up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave per year for the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate
family member, or for childbirth or adoption. An employee who assumes the role of caring for a
child is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological
relationship."
Construction,General Business,handbook,Kinyon Construction,FMLA|SICK LEAVE,leave|employee|service|family|must,2025-11-18T19:09:41.682817,968,"An employee who assumes the role of caring for a
child is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological
relationship. Either day-to-day care or financial support may establish a parental relationship when
the employee intends to assume the responsibilities of a parent with regard to a child. The Human
Resources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid

must provide notice of the leave as soon as practical. When requesting sick leave, employees
should not disclose any private medical information or any other confidential personal information. F. Non-Retaliation or Discrimination

The Company strictly prohibits any form of retaliation or discrimination against an employee for
attempting to use or using paid sick leave under this policy, and for any other reason prohibited by
applicable law. Notification Procedures

‘When you are absent from work and your absence has not been previously scheduled, you must
personally notify your immediate supervisor or manager as soon as you are aware that you will be
late or unable to report to work. Leaving a voicemail or message with another staff member does
not qualify as notifying your supervisor. ‘When absence is due to illness, the Company reserves the right to require appropriate medical
documentation. Such documentation need only include the employee’s name, the date and time
the employee was seen, and if applicable, a specific instruction regarding the employee’s
incapacity to perform his or her job. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness can result in discipline,
up to and including discharge. (Also see the section on Family & Medical Leave for extended
leave situations.)

If you are absent because of an accident or you are absent for longer than seven (7) days due to
illness, compensation is paid under the benefits of the Company’s short-term disability plan,
provided you are eligible for and participate in that plan. Military Service Leave

Employees serving in the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,
Coast Guard and Public Health Service commissioned corps, as well as the reserve components of
each of these services, may take unpaid military leave, as needed, to enable them to fulfill their
obligations as service members. Service members must provide advance written or verbal notice
to the Company for all military duty, unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded
by military necessity. Employees should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under
the circumstances. In addition, employees may, but are not required to, use accrued personal days
while performing military duty. Family and Medical Leave

The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows certain employees to take up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave per year for the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate
family member, or for childbirth or adoption. An employee who assumes the role of caring for a
child is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological
relationship. Either day-to-day care or financial support may establish a parental relationship when
the employee intends to assume the responsibilities of a parent with regard to a child. The Human
Resources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid

leave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave. To take FMLA leave, you must provide the Company with appropriate notice. If you know in
advance that you will need FMLA leave, you must notify the Human Resources Department at
least 30 days in advance. If you learn of your need for leave less than 30 days in advance, you
must give notice as soon as you can (generally either the day you learn of the need or the next
work day). When you need FMLA leave unexpectedly (for example, if a family member is injured
in an accident), you must inform the Human Resources Department as soon as you can. Military Caregiver Leave

The FMLA also allows an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of
kin of a member of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves or of certain recent veterans
with a serious illness or injury, up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period to care
for the injured or ill service member or veteran. A “serious illness or injury” is generally an injury
or illness incurred by the covered service member in the line of duty on active duty (or that existed
before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty
on active duty) that may render the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of the
member’s office, grade, rank, or rating."
Construction,General Business,handbook,Kinyon Construction,FLSA|FMLA,leave|weeks|active|military|caregiver,2025-11-18T19:09:41.686353,979,"An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave
and leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason in a single 12-month period, provided that the
employee may not take more than 12 weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason during
this period. (For example, in the single 12-month period an employee could take 12 weeks of
FMLA leave to care for a newborn child and 14 weeks of military caregiver leave, but could not
take 16 weeks of leave to care for a newborn child and 10 weeks of military caregiver leave.)
Generally, you must give the Company at least 30 days’ notice before the commencement of any
military caregiver leave. Qualifying (Military) Exigency Leave

The FMLA also provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period when an
eligible employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on (or has been notified of an impending
call to) “covered active duty” in the Armed Forces. (“Covered active duty” for members of a
regular component of the Armed Forces means duty during deployment of the member with the
Armed Forces to a foreign country. “Covered active duty” for members of the U.S. National Guard
and Reserves means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign
country under a call or order to active duty in a contingency operation.) The leave may also be
extended to the family members of certain retired military. This leave may be used to take care of
such things as child care or financial and legal arrangements necessitated by the deployment of the
family member. Break Time for Nursing Mothers

The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employees to take reasonable, unpaid break
time to express breast milk as needed for up to one (1) year after the birth of a child. The Company

leave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave. To take FMLA leave, you must provide the Company with appropriate notice. If you know in
advance that you will need FMLA leave, you must notify the Human Resources Department at
least 30 days in advance. If you learn of your need for leave less than 30 days in advance, you

Jury Duty

Kinyon Construction encourages employees to fulfill their civic duties. To that end, employees
will be allowed leave to serve on a jury, if summoned. We request that you bring in a copy of your
summons notice as soon as you receive it, so that we may keep it on file. If you are called during
a particularly busy period, we may ask you to request a postponement. The Company will provide
additional documentation in this regard, if necessary, to obtain such postponement. Jury duty can last from a portion of a single day to several months or more. During this time you
will be considered on a leave of absence and will be entitled to continue to participate in insurance
and other benefits as if you were working. While serving on jury duty, you are expected to call in
to your supervisor periodically to keep him or her apprised of your status. Appearance as a Witness

An employee called to appear as a witness will be permitted time off to appear, but without pay. Employees will be permitted to use accrued personal days when appearing as witnesses. Voting

Kinyon Construction encourages all employees to vote. Most polling facilities for elections for
public office are scheduled to accommodate working voters. The Company, therefore, requests
that employees schedule their voting for before or after their work shift. An employee who expects
a conflict, however, should notify his or her supervisor, in advance, so that schedules can be

them available outside your normal working hours. We may require that you review the records in
our presence. After your review and upon your written request, we will provide you with a copy of

Finding the best employees to work for the Company is of the utmost importance, and on
occasion, a relative of a current employee may be the best-qualified candidate for a position. In the
event that a relative of an employee is hired, the Company may:
 - Limit the supervisory/subordinate relationships of the relatives;
 - Limit the situations whereby one checks or verifies the work of the other; and
 - May limit the situations in which a conflict of interest is likely to exist;

The intent of these guidelines is to protect the Company and rights of other employees, not to put a
potential employee at a disadvantage due to his or her relationship with a current employee. When
appropriate, the Company may determine if alternative methods of organizing work are to be
considered to avoid disqualifying qualified candidates who are related to current employees. In the event that two existing employees become related while employed, the Company also
reserves the right to alter job assignments to minimize the impact of the reporting relationship. In
extreme cases termination may be necessary. To review your personnel records, you must make a written request. We will comply with your

These rules are guidelines only and are not all inclusive. The Company holds each of its employees to abide by certain work rules of general conduct and
performance at all times. The regulations governing employee conduct and responsibilities have
been established in the best interest of the company, its employees, and its customers. The usual sequence of corrective actions includes a verbal warning, a written warning, disciplinary
suspension and or probation from work without pay and benefits, and finally termination of
employment. In deciding which initial corrective action would be appropriate, management will
consider the seriousness of the action, the circumstances surrounding the matter, and the
employee’s previous record. Step No. 1: Verbal Warning
Inform the employee that he/she must correct his/her actions or further disciplinary action will be
taken; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the employee sign
the form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days. Step No. 2: Written Warning
When the performance or the policy violation does not improve or change, management will
explain to the employee that through observations, it appears that he/she is knowingly not meeting
the job requirement; explain that if the employee does not correct his/her actions he/she will be
subject to discipline; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the
employee sign the form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days."

10.1 A WORKPLACE ACCIDENT & INJURY REDUCTION (AWAIR)

The Company promotes a safe and healthful working condition for all employees. To do so,
management and employees will strive to reduce to extent and severity of work related injuries
and illnesses. The Company specifically proposes the following steps to meet that objective. All persons employed by the Company will become keenly AWAIR that reducing injuries
 is everyone’s business. Continued discussions, toolbox meetings, job site inspections by
 management, and an annual safety meeting are avenues we will use to become even more
 AWAIR of avoiding jobsite hazards. All employees of the Company will attend training sessions to enhance job skills. Any
 accident involving injury will be reported immediately so we can learn how to avoid that
 injury in the future. At the annual safety meeting, all employees will be asked their input
 in discussions where together we can identify, analyze, and control new and existing
 hazards, conditions, and operations. The issues raised at this meeting become priority
 items in our risk management. Our plan of action will be by verbal discussion at the safety meeting and followed up on
 issues that were raised and the appropriate way to minimize the risk of injury for each
 situation. Management will investigate the accident involving injury to see what caused the injury
 and what will be done to reduce future risk of that injury. This will be communicated to all
 employees. 10.2 GENERAL EMPLOYEE SAFETY RULES:

 Employees will be required to know the Company’s Safety & Health policy. Employees of the Company are required to attend tool box meetings and annual ""Right to
 Know"" training and ""Injury & Illness Prevention (AWAIR) Program"". Informal tool box meetings will be held to air any safety or hazard issues that may be
 discovered while working. Know the location of all safety equipment and how to use them. Put safety equipment
 back where they belong so the next person can find them. Employees must be familiar with safe operating procedures for each piece of equipment
 before operating it. Do not attempt to operate special machinery or equipment without
 permission and instructions. Employees must be familiar with OSHA'S safety regulations for jobs performed before
 starting. Employees are encouraged to suggest in person or anonymously, to Management of any
 equipment or procedure that is discovered to be a hazard, unsanitary, or dangerous to your
 health. Do not operate any equipment which in your opinion is unsafe or is in need of
 repair. Employees are required to report any injuries, accidents, or ""near misses"" to the office
 immediately so proper first aid or medical treatment can be given. Maintain and inspect all tools and equipment prior to their use. Use tools only for their intended purposes. Do not use broken or dangerously dull tools. All switches or drives on machinery shall be shut off and locked-out before cleaning,
 greasing, oiling, or making adjustments or repairs. Maintain and operate all equipment and vehicles in a clean and safe condition. Maintain good housekeeping in all your work areas. This is a reflection of the quality of
 your work. Disorder wastes time and energy and often results in injury. Use of seatbelts is mandatory while operating all company vehicles and equipment. BUCKLE UP!!!!!! Only authorized personnel should access equipment."

Employees will be instructed on how to control hazardous wastes and what to do if they are
exposed to hazardous wastes. If any employee suspects that the materials or wastes he/she may encounter as an employee are
hazardous (whether or not they are being created or used by the company), he/she should inform
the Immediate Supervisor immediately. As a Company, we are committed to not creating or disposing of hazardous wastes which will
contaminate the environment. Whenever possible, we will choose materials which have been
judged as non-hazardous and will properly dispose of hazardous materials if used. Also, we will
not knowingly dump any wastes into the environment at any time. 10.5 WRITTEN HAZARD COMMUNICATIONS/RIGHT TO KNOW PROGRAM

In order to comply with the OSHA Hazard Communication/Right to Know Standard, the following
Right to Know Program has been established for the Company. The Safety Officer is the program coordinator and has overall responsibility for the Hazard
Communication program. This program includes guidelines on identification of chemical hazards
and the proper use of labels and Safety Data Sheets. SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDS)
The Company maintains an inventory of all known chemicals in use on the work site, in the shop
and yard areas. A copy of the list is included with this program as well as with each set of SDS
sheets. Further information on each noted chemical can be obtained by reviewing the SDS sheet. Hazardous chemicals brought onto the work site will be included on the Hazardous Chemical
Inventory list which will be in the SDS booklet. The safety officer will be responsible for obtaining, maintaining, and updating the SDS. Copies of
SDS's for all hazardous chemicals and fact sheets to which employees may be exposed will be
kept in the office, employee pickup, shop, and in the pit tool van. CONTAINER LABELING
All chemicals will be stored in their original containers with a proper label attached. Workers may
dispense chemicals from original containers in small quantities for immediate use and any
chemical left over must be returned to the original container. No unmarked containers of any size are tube left in the work area unattended. Manufacturer labels
are to be left intact whenever possible. Containers that are not labeled will be relabeled. DO NOT leave extra oil in the oil cans!!!! EMPLOYEE TRAINING
All employees will receive the following training before being allowed to work with Hazardous
chemicals found in the work site. Read instructions on chemical container labels and SDS
before working with chemicals. Make sure you wear the correct gloves for the chemical
being used. 1. An overview of the Hazard Communication/Right to Know Standard and this written program. 2. The location and availability of the written Hazard Communication Program. 3.

Safety Rules for Lockout
 Never remove guards or reach around guards while any machine is operating. Prior to starting work on a piece of equipment, shut off the main power switch and place a
 lockout device on the switch. Make sure all movement has stopped before entering or servicing any machine. If more than one person is working at the same time, EVERY individual on that machine
 must have a lock on the lockout device. No lockout will be permitted to be cut off without
 authority from your supervisor. Any time you are working on presses, changing dies, or removing rules, the operator must
 lockout the machine and safety block must be in place. Lockouts must be placed when changing blade or adjusting blade. Make sure machine is clear, prior to restarting the machine. NO Machine down-time is worth LIFE, LIMB, or JOB!!!! Lockout Procedures
It is the responsibility of all supervisors to train employees on lockout procedures. This is
essentially due to the grave threat to life and limb. Lockout procedures must be documented on the
supervisor's safety training checklist. Enforcement of lockout shall be the responsibility of
supervisors and management. If equipment needs repair, alterations, inspections, clearing of jams, or cleaning, the
 equipment must be shut down and locked out. The machine operator and others must be notified that the equipment cannot be set into
 motion without supervisor's permission. All sources of power are to be identified, turned off, and locked out. All stored energy
 sources must be removed. All personnel must be clear of the equipment. The equipment
 must be turned on to be sure the equipment power source is locked out, and then turned off
 again. Your padlocks must be placed on the control switch, lever or valve, even though
 someone has locked the controls before you. You will not be protected unless you put your
 own padlock on it. Once lockout is completed, you must hang a ""danger tag"" on the controls showing the date
 and the employee's signature. Pad-lock and tags must be in place before any work can be
 performed. When work is done, you must replace all guards and remove your own padlock and tag. Never permit someone else to remove it for you. Be sure you are not exposing another
 person to danger by removing your padlock or sign. When power has to be continued in order to perform a job, the area supervisor must be
 notified. A maintenance employee or supervisor will stand by while work is being
 performed. When the job is completed, padlocks will be reinstalled. If work is not completed by the end of the shift or day, the person locking out the
 equipment must notify their supervisor. The supervisor will make sure locks and tags are
 changed to those that will continue the work. Examples of Energy for Lockout/Tagout Applies To:

The supervisor is responsible for inspecting the equipment before starting it. The
 supervisor must see that guards are in place and all personnel are clear of danger areas. 10.16 BACK INJURY PREVENTION

It is the responsibility of all supervisors to train employees on proper lifting techniques. Supervisors must correct employees when using incorrect lifting techniques. Approximately fifty percent of all personal injuries are caused by overexertion and most of these
injuries are back injuries. Everyone should follow these proper lifting techniques. The two-hand squat and stoop method as follows:
 Get close to the load and grasp it firmly, hugging it. Set your stomach muscles as if you were doing a pelvic tilt. This helps prepare them to
 support the load. Keep your back upright with a slight backward arch as you use your leg muscles to lift the
 load. Set the load down smoothly. The assisted one-hand lift method is as follows:
As you bend over into a container, rest your free hand on the edge of the container for support, and
use the other hand and to lift the object or part. As you come out of the lift, push down with your
free hand on the container edge to push your back and object up. When there is no container to rest
your free hand on, use the area right above your knee as an anchor point. The assisted one-hand lift method is a way of lifting that is shared by the shoulder muscles, which
are more developed than lower back muscles. This method does have limitations. This is the best
method when the weight to be lifted does not exceed 15-25 pounds. In addition, these are back injury prevention safety tips:
1. Lift comfortably. 2. Avoid unnecessary bending, twisting, and reaching. 3. Lift gradually and slowly. 4. Keep in good physical shape. If at all possible use a skidloader or get help!!! Don’t think you’re Superman."

All waste fluids (oil and other fluids) drained from any equipment will be collected, stored in
proper containers, labeled and disposed of in an approved manner. Waste oil must be recovered at
all times. Waste oil from the jobsite may be brought to the shop facility and stored for future
 consumption or disposal. All disposal filters to be placed in 50 gallon barrel for proper disposal. 10.18 GARBAGE

All garbage is to be cleaned out of vehicles & equipment daily (no exceptions). Place garbage in brown receptacle east side of shop. Recyclable material (plastic, glass, steel & aluminum, paper & cardboard) in blue
 receptacle east side of shop. If you are in doubt about what’s recyclable the list is on the bulletin board. > The supervisor is responsible for inspecting the equipment before starting it. The

free hand on the container edge to push your back and object up. When there is no container to rest
your free hand on, use the area right above your knee as an anchor point. The assisted one-hand lift method is a way of lifting that is shared by the shoulder muscles, which
are more developed than lower back muscles. This method does have limitations. This is the best
method when the weight to be lifted does not exceed 15-25 pounds. In addition, these are back injury prevention safety tips:
1. Lift comfortably. 2. Avoid unnecessary bending, twisting, and reaching. 3. Lift gradually and slowly. 4. Keep in good physical shape. If at all possible use a skidloader or get help!!! Don’t think you’re Superman. 10.17 WASTE CONTAINMENT

All waste fluids (oil and other fluids) drained from any equipment will be collected, stored in
proper containers, labeled and disposed of in an approved manner. Waste oil must be recovered at
all times. > Waste oil from the jobsite may be brought to the shop facility and stored for future
consumption or disposal. > All disposal filters to be placed in 50 gallon barrel for proper disposal. 10.18 GARBAGE

All garbage is to be cleaned out of vehicles & equipment daily (no exceptions). > Place garbage in brown receptacle east side of shop. > Recyclable material (plastic, glass, steel & aluminum, paper & cardboard) in blue
receptacle east side of shop. If you are in doubt about what’s recyclable the list is on the bulletin board. ---

ACCIDENTS
In case of an accident, these are the procedures to be followed:
 If possible, get the vehicle to the side of the road, out of the traffic lane. Park away from the accident if stopping to help. Put emergency flashers on. Set out reflective triangles. Notify authorities either by radio or phone or send someone for help. Call 911 or other
 emergency numbers. If a qualified person is on the scene, stay out of their way. Don't move a severely injured person unless absolutely necessary for their safety. If you are involved in an accident you are required to:
Collect information on the accident. Who were the persons involved? Names? Were there any apparent injuries? What was the damage to any vehicles or property? Make notes on how the accident occurred. Document time and location of accident. Notify the office as soon as possible. Only discuss details of the accident with the proper authorities. Try to stay calm and use good judgment. Never admit to fault, this will be decided later. Drivers should always practice defensive driving techniques and be courteous to other vehicles on
the road. DRIVER REQUIREMENTS
 All trucks weighed must meet State of Minnesota Gross Vehicle Weight Requirements. This includes a maximum weight of 80,000 lbs. or less, depending on the length, number
 of axles and distance between axles. All Drivers are responsible for meeting state, county, and city bridge law requirements. This applies to single, tandem, tri-axle, quad-axle and 5 axle trucks. All frame rails and undercarriage must be cleaned prior to exiting load site. All trucks must have mud flaps in place.

I. Goods and Services Provided

Our company has two divisions: Jacob Sheet Metal Works and Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning. Jacob Sheet Metal Works fabricates in light gauge sheet metal. We offer galvanized, black iron
(cold rolled) metal, aluminum, stainless steel and copper. Our 10' power shear can handle up to
16-gauge galvanized metal (the lower the number, the thicker the material). We do not do any
welding, including of aluminum. We solder galvanized, stainless steel and copper. Our sales
include everything from small over-the-counter orders, to work performed for various industrial
and commercial firms in our area. It is the policy of the company that over-the-counter sheet metal orders will be taken on a first
come, first serviced basis. Discretion will be used to prioritize orders that offer more revenue and
benefit to the company (ex: a $2000 job vs. a $10 order). The company will make every attempt
to advise customers of an appropriate timeframe that it will take to fulfill an order. It is important to note that sheet metal ductwork used by our air conditioning division is fabricated
in our shop and these jobs will take precedence to other sheet metal jobs due the primary nature
of the business. Most typical duct fittings, such as elbows, boots, and collars are purchased through wholesale
distributors. We generally use sheet metal trunk lines, wrapped in duct wrap insulation, followed
by flex supply runs. It is the philosophy of the company that this provides the customer with a
superior duct system, and JH&A is the only company in the area that offers this. We will use
fiberglass duct board for plenums and trunk lines as the specific job is bid. Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning conducts business in HVAC repair, maintenance, equipment
sales and installation. Our sales are primarily residential and light commercial."

III. History of Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning:

Jacob Sheet Metal Works was founded in 1921 by Rudolph Jacob, Robert Jacob's grandfather. He moved to DeLand from Ohio and began working with a wooden brake installing metal roofs,
copper work, guttering, and later warm air heating ducts. In those days, metal was shipped down
the St. John's River and received at the Lake Beresford settlement."

brother, Ervin Jacob, also worked with the company until 1977. The business was incorporated
in 1964. Jacob Sheet Metal Works continued as a thriving business in DeLand during the 50’s, 60's and
70’s. The company started concentrating on central heating & air conditioning installations as their
popularity grew. Throughout the years, the company has gained a reputation in West Volusia County as the topquality repair and installation company. We have many customers who have been doing business
with Jacob Sheet Metal 30-60 years, and we respect these people tremendously. Jacob Sheet

Robert Jacob grew up in the family business. He obtained college degrees from Daytona Beach
Community College and Florida Atlantic University and joined the firm in 1974 after servicing in
the U.S. Army. Robert’s wife, Kim Jacob spent her career as an elementary school teacher. Robert and Kim have two children, Jennifer and Clinton. Robert is an active member and deacon
in the First Presbyterian Church of DeLand. Robert's father, Paul, retired, but continued to lead an active life, working around the sheet metal
shop nearly every day, until he passed away at the age of 88. In 1998 our heating & air conditioning business evolved to becoming 85% of the company's total
sales. Even then, many people in town did not realize that the company did A/C work due to the
name, “Jacob Sheet Metal Works.” For that reason, Robert decided it was time to clarify the
position in the marketplace by creating a branch called ""Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning."" This
change resulted in major growth in our company, as we now have one of the most recognized
names in West Volusia County. Other internal changes have occurred in recent years, including becoming more efficient. In 2000

JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning
Employee Handbook

101. Nature of Employment

This handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel
policies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook,
for it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about
employment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is
not intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is
bound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship
at any time. In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A
reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in
this handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will. The only recognized deviations from
the stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A. 102. Employee Relations

JH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are
competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees
have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice
these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors,"" the
work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding
effectively to employee concerns. 103. Equal Employment Opportunity

In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals,
employment decisions at JH&A will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. JH&A does
not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,

101. Nature of Employment

This handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel
policies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook,
for it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about
employment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is
not intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is
bound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship
at any time. In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A
reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in
this handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will."
FieldServiceTechnicians,General Business,handbook,Jacob Heating And Cooling,,employees|conduct|will|employee|that,2025-11-18T19:09:44.126921,1021,"In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A
reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in
this handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will. The only recognized deviations from
the stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A. 102. Employee Relations

JH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are
competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees
have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice
these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors,"" the
work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding
effectively to employee concerns. 103. Equal Employment Opportunity

In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals,
employment decisions at JH&A will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. JH&A does
not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
disability, veteran status, national origin, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment,
compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. ---

employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct

problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at
work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working
relationships. All hiring of family will be considered in a case-by-case basis in consideration of
organizational impact. ·

In cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory
relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or terminated from
employment. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or
whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or
marriage. 106. Employee Medical Examinations

To help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely, medical examinations may
be required. After an offer has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical
questionnaire will be required, and a medical examination may be required at JH&A's expense by
a health professional of JH&A's choice. The offer of employment and assignment to duties is
contingent upon completion of the questionnaire. Any employee off work more than three continuous workdays for an unforeseen illness or injury
may be required to present JH&A with a written status report from a qualified healthcare provider. The status report must contain a diagnosis of the illness or injury, an acceptable explanation of
why the employee cannot perform his or her job duties, and a reasonable expected return-to-work
date. (Also see employee policies under Section 601 ""Medical Leave""). Information on an employee's medical condition or history will be kept separate from other
employee information and maintained confidentially. Access to this information will be limited to
those who have a legitimate need to know. 107. Immigration Law Compliance

JH&A is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to
work in the United States and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or
national origin. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a
condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form 1-9 and
present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who
are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed a 1-9 with JH&A within the
past three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged
to contact the Controller. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law
compliance without fear of reprisal. 108. Conflicts of Interest

Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or
potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which JH&A
wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction
so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable
standards of operation. Contact Management for more information or questions about conflicts of
interest. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a
decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of JH&A's
business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood
or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related
by blood or marriage. No ""presumption of guilt"" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or
leases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of JH&A as soon as possible the existence
of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all
parties. Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant
ownership in a firm with which JH&A does business, but also when an employee or relative
receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any
transaction or business dealings involving JH&A. 109. Outside Employment

Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they are open and honest about their outside
employment with their direct supervisor and meet the performance standards of their job with
JH&A. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to
JH&A's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the outside
role precedes employment with JH&A, the employee should make the intention to maintain their
outside position during the application/interview process with JH&A. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

If JH&A determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to
meet the requirements of JH&A as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be
asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with JH&A. ""Moonlighting,"" or outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside JH&A for
materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs. Due to various reasons, the following will be considered as unacceptable conflicts of interests:

 - Working for a competitor as a direct employee or as a subcontractor

 - Taking business away from JH&A by serving an existing customer

 - Any business that uses JH&A time or material. It is important to note that service performed by an individual employee outside of JH&A business
hours could be interpreted as JH&A related work from a legal perspective, and that it is against
the law for a homeowner to hire an unlicensed individual to perform work. JH&A is in no way
responsible for business performed by an individual outside of assigned jobs/duties. 110. Non-Disclosures

The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and
the success of JH&A. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following
examples:

 - wages or personal employee data

 - computer programs and codes ·

 - customer lists

 - customer preference

 - financial information

 - marketing strategies

 - pricing for pending projects and proposals

Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business s information
will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal
action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information

111. Disability Accommodations

JH&A is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring
equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. All employment practices
and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful
employment opportunities. Pre-employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's
ability to perform the duties of the position. Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where their disability affects
the performance of job functions. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the
situation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation
(or changes in compensation) as well as in job assignments, classifications, organizational
structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists. Leave of all types will be
available to all employees on an equal basis. JH&A is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified employees or applicants
because they are related to or associated with a person with a disability. JH&A will follow any
state or local law that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA. This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. JH&A is committed to taking all other actions
necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance
with the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. 112. Employment Categories

It is the intent of JH&A to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees
understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee
employment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the employment
relationship at will at any time is retained by both the employee and JH&A. Each employee is designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage
and hour laws. NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific
provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT employees are excluded from specific provisions
of federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee's EXEMPT or NONEXEMPT classification
may be changed only upon written notification by JH&A management. In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong lo one other employment category:

REGULAR FULL-TIME employees are those who are not in a temporary or introductory status
and who are regularly scheduled to work JH&A's full-time schedule. Generally, they are eligible
for JH&A's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit
program. PART-TIME employees are those who are not assigned to a temporary or introductory status and
who are regularly scheduled to work less than 32 hours per week. While they do receive all legally
mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are
ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. INTRODUCTORY employees are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine
whether further employment in a specific position or with JH&A is appropriate. Employees who
satisfactorily complete the introductory period will be notified of their new employment
classification. TEMPORARY employees are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily
supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment
assignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated
period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain
that status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally
mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are
ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. CASUAL employees are tho.se who have established an employment relationship with JH&A but
who are assigned to work on an intermittent and/or unpredictable basis. While they receive all
legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they
are ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. 113. Access to Personnel Files

JH&A maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information
as the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance
appraisals and salary increases, and other employment records. Personnel files are the property of JH&A, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of JH&A who have a legitimate reason
to review information in a file are allowed to do so. Employees who wish to review their own file should contact their manager. With reasonable
advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in JH&A's offices and in the

114. Employment Reference Checks

To ensure that individuals who join JH&A are well qualified and have a strong potential to be
productive and successful, it is the policy of JH&A to check the references of all applicants. All
applicants will be asked, in writing, to authorize background checks for felony convictions, driver’s
license reports, workers comp reports, and a nation-wide search on sex offender violations. The
information obtained from the screening will be considered on a case by case basis and each
situation will be considered individually. Management will respond in writing only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in
writing. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and
position(s) held. 115. Personnel Data Changes

It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify JH&A of any changes in personnel
data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents,
individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, and other
such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personnel data has
changed, notify the Office Manager. 116. Introductory Period

The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their
ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position
meets their expectations. JH&A uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits,
and overall performance. Either the employee or JH&A may end the employment relationship at
will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice. All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after
their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the
length of the absence. If JH&A determines that the designated introductory period does not allow
sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may
be extended for a specified period. Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the ""regular""
employment classification. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

changed, notify the Office Manager. 116. Introductory Period

The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their
ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position
meets their expectations. JH&A uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits,
and overall performance. Either the employee or JH&A may end the employment relationship at
will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice. All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after
their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the
length of the absence. If JH&A determines that the designated introductory period does not allow
sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may
be extended for a specified period. Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the ""regular""
employment classification. ---

During the introductory period, new employees are eligible for those benefits that are required by
law, such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security. After becoming regular
employees, they may also be eligible for other JH&A provided benefits, subject to the terms and
conditions of each benefits program. Employees should read the information for each specific
benefits program for the details on eligibility requirements. Your employment with JH&A is a voluntary one and is subject to termination by you or JH&A at
will, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall
be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the employment-at-will
status of JH&A employees. This policy of employment-at-will may not be modified by any officer or employee and shall not
be modified in any publication or document. The only exception to this policy is a written
employment agreement approved at the discretion of the President or the Board of Directors,
whichever is applicable. 117. Employment Applications

JH&A relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well
as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any
misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may
result in JH&A's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the
person has been hired, termination of employment. 118. Performance Evaluation

Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an
informal, day-to-day basis. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide
both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct
weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches
for meeting goals. Performance evaluations are scheduled approximately every 12 months, generally occurring in
the late spring. Merit-based pay adjustments are awarded by JH&A in an effort to recognize truly superior
employee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous
factors, including the information documented by this formal performance evaluation process. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

requests for PTO will be accommodated the best of JH&A’s ability, but are not guaranteed. Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining
whether overtime pay is owed. 121. Workers' Compensation Insurance

JH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to
employees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that
requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements,
workers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee
is hospitalized, immediately. Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor
immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be
reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as
possible. Depending on the requirements of the Worker’s Compensation insurance provider, and
the situation, a drug and/or alcohol test may be required of the employee to submit a claim. Neither JH&A nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation
benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty
recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by JH&A. 122. Time Off to Vote

JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work
schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, JH&A will
grant up to 1 hour of paid time off to vote. Employees should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two working days prior to
the election day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at
the beginning or end of the work shift, whichever provides the least disruption to the normal work
schedule."

123. Jury Duty

JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when
required. JH&A will pay an employee for up to 5 days of jury duty, with proof of summons. After 5
days, employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired,
employees may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits). Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the
supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Employees are expected to
report for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the
employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. JH&A will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave. 124. Witness Duty

JH&A encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by JH&A,
they will receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. Employees will be granted unpaid time off to appear in court as a witness when requested by a
party other than JH&A. Employees are free to use any available paid leave benefit (such as
vacation leave) to receive compensation for the period of this absence. The subpoena should be shown to the employee's supervisor immediately after it is received so
that operating requirements can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee's
absence. The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. 125. Benefits Continuation (COBRA)

The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and
their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under JH&A's
health plan when a ""qualifying event"" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common

qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a
reduction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal
separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at JH&A's group rates
plus an administration fee. JH&A provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing
rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under JH&A's
health insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations. 126. Educational Assistance

JH&A recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the
organization. Individual courses or courses that are part of a degree, licensing, or certification program must be
related to the employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position in the organization in
order to be eligible for educational assistance. JH&A has the sole discretion to determine whether
a course relates to an employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position. Employees
should contact Management for more information or questions about educational assistance and
financial availability for educational assistance. The following pay guidelines will apply when employees are attending classes, seminars and
educational courses, and their attendance is specifically required by Jacob Heating & Air
Conditioning:

- Employees attending company-required classes during their regular workday hours, Monday
through Friday, will be paid a total of their hours worked and the hours spent in class and travel
during the day. - Employees attending company-required classes commencing and ending after their regular
workday hours, will be paid overtime wages for time spent in class beyond their regular 40-hour
work week. - Any courses pursued for personal development, which are not company mandated, can be
considered to be financed through the company, but hourly wages will not be paid to the employee

127. Paid Time OFF (PTO)

Paid Time Off (PTO) is an all-purpose time-off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation,
illness or injury, and personal business. It combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into
one flexible, paid time-off policy. Employees in the following employment classification(s) are
eligible to earn and use PTO as described in this policy:

 - Regular full-time employees

Once employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to accrue PTO according
to the schedule below. Accrued PTO is available for use immediately after accrual. PTO can be
used in minimum increments of one-half hour. The employee’s accrued balance will be capped at the maximum PTO balance amount listed in
the PTO schedule. PTO accrued in excess of this maximum balance amount will be lost. Note: The amount of PTO accrued increases with the length of employment, as shown in the
following schedule:

 Months of Eligible PTO Hours Accrued Annual Rate of PTO Maximum PTO

 180 2.62 136 136

 240 3.38 176 176

 300 4.15 216 216

The length of eligible service is calculated based on a ""benefit year."" This is the 12-month period
that begins when the employee starts to earn PTO. An employee's benefit year may be extended
for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. Military leave has no effect
on this calculation (see individual leave of absence policies for more information.)

JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning
Employee Handbook

To schedule planned PTO of 5 or more consecutive working days, employees must submit a PTO
request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 4 weeks of advance notice. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing
requirements. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted as
requested. Employees who have an unexpected need to be absent from work must notify their Supervisor
before the start of the workday. If additional days of absence are then required, the employee
must notify their Supervisor every additional day before the start of the workday with a phone call. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted, even in the case of
emergency. PTO PAY RATES:

PTO is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence. It does not include overtime
or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift
differentials. PTO cannot be used in combination with base time to earn more than 40 hours per
week. PTO must be entered into the employee’s timecard for the affected week. PTO not recorded on
a timecard will not be awarded/paid. PTO is a “use-it-or-lose-it” benefit. Unused PTO will not be paid out to an employee for any
reason. If an employee resigns and returns to employment at JH&A on later date, their eligibility for paid
time off benefits will revert to that of a new employee. Personal time off without pay, family leave and Military Leave will have an effect on the calculation
of accumulated PTO. Accumulation of PTO stops when an employee is absent during personal
time off. 128. Health Insurance

To schedule planned PTO of 5 or more consecutive working days, employees must submit a PTO
request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 4 weeks of advance notice. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing
requirements. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted as
requested. Employees who have an unexpected need to be absent from work must notify their Supervisor
before the start of the workday. If additional days of absence are then required, the employee
must notify their Supervisor every additional day before the start of the workday with a phone call. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted, even in the case of
emergency. PTO PAY RATES:

PTO is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence. It does not include overtime
or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift
differentials. PTO cannot be used in combination with base time to earn more than 40 hours per
week. PTO must be entered into the employee’s timecard for the affected week. PTO not recorded on
a timecard will not be awarded/paid. PTO is a “use-it-or-lose-it” benefit. Unused PTO will not be paid out to an employee for any
reason. If an employee resigns and returns to employment at JH&A on later date, their eligibility for paid
time off benefits will revert to that of a new employee. Personal time off without pay, family leave and Military Leave will have an effect on the calculation

of accumulated PTO. Accumulation of PTO stops when an employee is absent during personal

Eligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions
of the agreement between JH&A and the insurance carrier. A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the
health insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) policy
for more information. Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An
SPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible
employees. Contact the Administrative Office for more information about health insurance
benefits. 129. Timekeeping

Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and
state laws require JH&A to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee
pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Hourly nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work,
as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the
beginning and ending time of any departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must
always be approved before it is performed. Time sheets are available in the office. If a specific day's time sheet is not available, employees
should inform the office personnel immediately. It is the employee's responsibility to tum in their timecard on a timely basis. Failure to do so could
result in a delay of pay. A time sheet must be turned in even when the employee is on vacation, out sick, or taking
personal time off. The time sheet should be marked with an explanation of the absence. It is the employee's responsibility to sign their time sheet to certify the accuracy of all time
recorded. Office personnel will review the time record for accuracy before payroll processing. If
an employee has not correctly documented his or her time, corrections will be made in the total
hours worked, according to the stop and start times recorded. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time
record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment."

130. Paydays

All employees are paid weekly. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed
through the end of the previous payroll period. Our payroll period runs from Wednesday to
Tuesday. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a holiday, employees
will receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday, unless the office
personnel are unable to complete payroll due to unforeseen circumstances. In such case,
employees will receive pay on the first day of work after the regularly scheduled payday. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee may receive his or her
earned wages before departing for vacation if a written request is submitted to the office at least
one week prior to departing for vacation. 131. Employment Terminations

Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and
many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common
circumstances under which employment is terminated:

 - Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee. - Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization. - Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for nondisciplinary reasons. Since employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent, both the employee and JH&A have
the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time. Employees will
receive their final pay in accordance with applicable state law. Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. All
accrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid. Some benefits may
be continued at the employee's expense if the employee so chooses. The employee will be
notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations
of such continuance. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

132. On-Call Pay

All field technicians are provided with on-call stipends in the instance of being required to report
to work on weekends. All notice of potential work should be provided by management to the
employee(s) by the afternoon prior in order to allow for the employee to have adequate
preparation. 133. Administrative Pay Corrections

JH&A takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in
each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly
bring the discrepancy to the attention of Management so that corrections can be made as quickly
as possible. 134. Pay Deductions and Setoffs

The law requires that JH&A make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. JH&A also must deduct Social
Security taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security
""wage base."" JH&A matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee. JH&A offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law. Eligible employees may
voluntarily authorize deductions from their pay checks to cover the costs of participation in these
programs. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by JH&A, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to JH&A
or others. Certain pay deductions, such as wage garnishments, credit union and insurance plans, art
directed by law and cannot be altered by JH&A. Even though an employee may work a limited
number of hours in a given payroll week, specific deductions must be made. Employees cannot
choose to cancel certain deductions for a specific payroll period. If an employee does not have
enough earned wages to support such a required payroll deduction, the deduction may be taken
in the following weeks until the obligation is paid. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

If you have questions concerning why deductions were made from your pay check or how they
were calculated, your supervisor can assist in having your questions answered. 135. Safety

To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and
visitors, JH&A has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for
JH&A. Management is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating
the safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. An M.S.D.S. application (Material Safety Data Sheets) for materials and chemicals used in our
workplace is also provided on smart devices in each vehicle. Employees may view the Safety
Program Manual or the digital M.S.D.S. sheets at any time, and are responsible for maintaining
access via single sign on through the provided application. JH&A provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through
regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board
postings, memos, or other written communications. Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers
potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or
minimize hazards. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns,
or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their
supervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the President. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who
fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear,
employees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor. Such reports
are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance and workers' compensation benefits
procedures. 136. Work Schedules

The normal work schedule for all employees is 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Supervisors will
advise employees of the times their schedules will normally begin and end. Staffing needs and
operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations
in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. 137. Use of Phone System & Cell Phones

Personal use of a company telephone for long-distance and toll calls is not permitted. Employees
should practice discretion when making local personal calls and may be required to reimburse
JH&A for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone. Use of cell phones for personal calls during regular working hours is not permitted. Employees should practice discretion and inform their family and friends of the company's policy
regarding this issue. Personal use of cell phones could lead to suspension and termination. Employees who have been assigned a cell phone will use it only for official company business. To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always employ customer
service best practices. 138. Smoking

In keeping with JH&A's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking in the
workplace is discouraged. Nonsmoking areas are clearly designated where smoking is expressly
prohibited, and employees are asked to respect these designations. In situations where the
preferences of smokers and nonsmokers are in direct conflict, the preferences of nonsmokers will

in the Employee Handbook. It is JH&A's policy to give each Service Technician the choice of either driving his assigned vehicle
back and forth to his home each work day, or leaving it at the Jacob Heating & Air parking lot
each night. A form indicating the employee's choice will be given to each Service Technician for
his signature. A copy will be placed in the employee's personnel file. The company's position on this matter is that the employee should be aware he does not need to
provide his own vehicle to drive to work, and he does not pay gas, insurance or wear and tear on
his own vehicle. If the Service Technician chooses to drive the company vehicle home, his wages will begin when
he is dispatched to his first call of the day. The employee’s wages will end when he completes his
last call of the day, unless he is outside a 10-mile radius of his home. In such case, the employee
will be paid until crossing the 10-mile radius. Drive time from the employee's home to the shop for a Company meeting or training session will
not be compensated. When the Service Technician is ""on-call"" and is required to leave his home for an emergency
service call, wages will be paid from the employee's home to the customer and drive time back. A Service Technician who is officially ""on-call"" will be paid a flat On-Call Bonus of $75.00 per
week. This bonus pay is defined as compensation for being paged by the Answering Service and
returning phone calls to the customers, whether any pages or phone calls are actually received
or not. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES: Service Technicians who choose to drive their
company-assigned vehicle home will be required to fulfill the following responsibilities. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning

4. If an employee is involved in an accident or any traffic incident, he must immediately report
it to the office. In almost every case, the employee may be required to wait at the accident
site until the police arrive and a police report is filed. In all cases, the employees involved
will be required to fully cooperate with the patrol man and insurance company
investigations. 5. Likewise, if an employee receives a traffic citation or parking ticket, it must be immediately
reported to his supervisor. All parking tickets must be turned into the office the same day. 142. Use of Company Supplied Vehicle

to guarantee that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner. 148. Workplace Violence Prevention

JH&A is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. Given the increasing violence in society in general, JH&A has adopted the following guidelines to
deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence that may occur during
business hours or on its premises. All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, should be treated with courtesy
and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, ""horseplay,"" or other
conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous
devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of JH&A without proper authorization. Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, or a member of
the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all
acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any
characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible
to your immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by
employees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work
station, do not try to intercede or see what is happening. JH&A will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence and of
suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected
as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation,
JH&A may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation. Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in

JH&A encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the
attention of their supervisors or Management before the situation escalates into potential violence. JH&A is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees
for raising such concerns. 149. Medical Leave

JH&A provides medical leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who are temporarily
unable to work due to a serious health condition or disability. For purposes of this policy, serious
health conditions or disabilities include inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical
care facility; continuing treatment by a health care provider; and temporary disabilities associated
with pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request medical leave as
described in this policy. - Regular full-time employees

Eligible employees may request medical leave only after having completed 365 calendar days of
service. Exceptions to the service requirement will be considered to accommodate disabilities. Eligible employees should make requests for medical leave to their supervisors at least 30 days
in advance of foreseeable events and as soon as possible for unforeseeable events. A health care provider's statement must be submitted verifying the need for medical leave and its
beginning and expected ending dates. Any changes in this information should be promptly
reported to JH&A. Employees returning from medical leave must submit a health care provider's
verification of their fitness to return to work. Eligible employees are normally granted leave for the period of the disability, up to a maximum of
6 weeks within any 12-month period. Any combination of medical leave and family leave may not
exceed this maximum limit. If the initial period of approved absence proves insufficient,
consideration will be given to a request for an extension. Employees will be required to first use
any accrued paid leave time before taking unpaid medical leave. Employees who sustain work-related injuries are eligible for a medical leave of absence for the
period of disability in accordance with all applicable laws covering occupational disabilities."

consideration will be given to a request for an extension. Employees will be required to first use
any accrued paid leave time before taking unpaid medical leave. Employees who sustain work-related injuries are eligible for a medical leave of absence for the
period of disability in accordance with all applicable laws covering occupational disabilities. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits

will be provided by JH&A until the end of the month in which the medical leave begins. At that
time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage

JH&A provides family leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time
off from work duties to fulfill family obligations relating directly to childbirth, adoption, or placement
of a foster child; or to care for a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition. A serious

Violations this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of
employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment
program. Such violations may also have legal consequences. To inform employees about important provisions of this policy, JH&A has established a drug-free
awareness program. The program provides information on the dangers and effects of substance
abuse in the workplace, resources available to employees, and consequences for violations of
this policy. Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged
to use the resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these
matters with their supervisor or the President to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate
resources in the community. Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate
subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a
rehabilitation or treatment program through JH&A's health insurance benefit coverage. Leave may
be granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all
JH&A policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the
leave will not cause JH&A any undue hardship. Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace
should raise their concerns with their supervisor or the President without fear of reprisal. 154. Sexual and Other Unlawful
Harassment

JH&A is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful
harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity,
age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. As an example,
sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of employee misconduct that is demeaning
to another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly
prohibited. Any employee who wants to report an incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment should
promptly report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the employee
believes it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately
contact the President or any other member of management. Employees can raise concerns and

resignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits. 159. Security Inspections

JH&A wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms,
explosives, or other improper materials. To this end, JH&A prohibits the possession, transfer,
sale, or use of such materials on its premises. JH&A requires the cooperation of all employees in
administering this policy. Company vehicles, desks, drawers, bins, and other storage devices may be provided for the
convenience of employees but remain the sole property of JH&A. Accordingly, they, as well as
any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or representative of JH&A at any
time, either with or without prior notice. JH&A likewise wishes to discourage theft or unauthorized possession of the property of
employees, JH&A, visitors, and customers. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, JH&A or its
representative may inspect not only company vehicles, desks, and drawers but also persons
entering and/or leaving the premises and any packages or other belongings. Any employee who

In an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by
JH&A may not solicit or distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose. JH&A recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the
workplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities
during working time. (Working time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other
periods in which employees are not on duty.)

In addition, the posting of written solicitations on company bulletin boards is restricted. These
bulletin boards display important information, and employees should consult them frequently for:

 - Employee announcements

 - Internal memoranda

 - Organization announcements

 - Workers' compensation insurance information

 - State disability insurance/unemployment insurance information. If employees have a message of interest to the workplace, they may submit it to the Controller for
approval. All approved messages will be posted by the Controller. 161. Drug Testing

JH&A is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all
employees. Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious
safety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants
and employees may be asked to provide body substance samples (such as urine and/or blood)
to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, in a case where a Worker’s
Comp claim is submitted, drug or alcohol screening may be required. Refusal to submit to drug
testing may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides confidential counseling and referral services
to employees for assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. It is

The purpose of this policy is to stale JH&A's position on administering equitable and consistent
discipline for unsatisfacto1y conduct in the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one
that does not have to be enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all
employment levels. JH&A's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain
that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary
action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory
service in the future. Although employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent and both the employee and JH&A
have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, JH&A
may use progressive discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension
with or without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and
the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will
normally be followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed
by a written warning; another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may
then lead to termination of employment. JH&A recognizes that there are certain types of employee problems that are serious enough to
justify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going
through the usual progressive discipline steps. While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be deemed a serious offense, the

messages, pictures, images, objects, writings, words, gestures, or physical contact. In general, discrimination and harassment can be deﬁned as conduct that disparages or shows
hostility or aversion toward a protected status. It can take many forms, including: epithets or slurs;
threats; derogatory names, comments, objects or visual depictions; jokes or teasing; and other
verbal, nonverbal, written, visual or physical conduct that is based on a protected status. Sexual harassment in particular can include a range of subtle or blatant behaviors and may involve
individuals of the same or diﬀerent gender. It can be generally deﬁned as: unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or conduct of a sexual nature including, but not limited to,
sexually-related images, jokes, teasing, uninvited touching or other sexually-related conduct when:

 - submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
 individual's employment;
 - submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for
 employment decisions aﬀecting such individual; or
 - such conduct has the purpose or eﬀect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work
 performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or oﬀensive working environment. Sexual harassment does not need to be motivated by sexual desire to be unlawful or to violate this
policy. For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of their gender, gender identity or
expression, or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment, regardless of whether the
treatment is motivated by sexual desire. Additional examples of sexual harassment include:

- Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:
 o Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another
 employee’s body or poking another employee’s body;
 o Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults. - Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:

 - Exempt: Exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis and are not eligible to receive
 overtime pay. - Nonexempt: Nonexempt employees are paid on an hourly basis and are eligible to receive
 overtime pay for overtime hours worked. Full-Time

employment status, you are considered to be full-time. Generally, as a full-time employee, you are
eligible for our full-time beneﬁts package and are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of
each program. Part-Time
If you work a regular schedule of 10 hours or more but less than 30 hours per week, then you are
considered part-time. As part-time, you may be eligible for some beneﬁts and are subject to the
terms, condition and limitations for each program. Some part-time employees may also be classiﬁed
as “seasonal” and work hours during holiday seasons and college breaks. Temporary Employees. If you are hired for a speciﬁed project or time frame and may work an irregular schedule, you are
considered temporary. Temporary employees are not eligible for beneﬁts provided by Home Bank,

Exempt employees will use the Time Oﬀ Request feature. These records may be required by
governmental regulations and are used to calculate regular and overtime pay when applicable. If you
forget a time punch, you must immediately notify your supervisor in order to correct your time. Under no circumstances are you allowed to clock in or out for another employee or clock yourself
out and continue working. You are also not allowed to use the ADP phone app to clock in/out unless

General Information
PTO days are earned at the accrual rates in the above table with annual maximums. PTO days are
accrued per pay period. Employees become eligible and begin accruing PTO after the ﬁrst sixty (60)
days of employment. PTO does not accrue during the use of Short Term Disability, Workers’
Compensation, or any Approved Leave of Absence (regardless of reason). When an employee takes time oﬀ for any reason not covered under another paid leave beneﬁt, the
employee must use any accrued PTO before taking the time oﬀ unpaid. PTO requests must be submitted through ADP and subject to approval by management. Home Bank
will try to accommodate PTO requests; however, all PTO requests are subject to availability and
staﬃng needs. In an eﬀort to accommodate the desires of our employees who would like to take
PTO earlier in the year, employees may be permitted to borrow against the PTO they expect to
accrue over the course of the calendar year. However, if your employment with Home Bank is
terminated for any reason prior to the time that you have accumulated the number of PTO days
taken during that calendar year, you are responsible for reimbursing Home Bank for the amount of
used but unaccrued PTO. A deduction will be processed for employees who have a negative PTO as
of 12/31, annually. These deductions will be made on the ﬁnal payroll, for terminated employees, and
on the last payroll of the year for active employees. Unused PTO at year-end will be forfeited, unless prohibited by state law. Upon termination, all PTO
accrued as of the previous January 1, and not yet taken will be payable with the employee’s ﬁnal
paycheck. Holidays
Holidays are selected by Home Bank annually and usually follow the federal holiday schedule. Home Bank may also close locations early or otherwise for various occasions. You can view holiday
updates on ONENET>Bank Calendar. All full-time employees will receive their regular rate of pay for approved holidays (not to exceed 8
hours). A holiday will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime. Part-time employees who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible to receive holiday pay if
that holiday falls on their regularly scheduled day (for example, Sally works 5 hours a day on
Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. Labor Day is scheduled on a Monday, so that means Sally will
receive 5 hours of holiday pay.)

PTO or Time Oﬀ Awards on the day before and/or after a bank paid holiday should always be
scheduled in advance and is subject to management approval. If an employee calls in sick and/or
schedules it as a sick day, a doctor’s note may be required in order to utilize any available sick time."

 the employee’s job (up to 12 weeks);

- to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness related to certain types of
 military service (up to 26 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or

weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a covered service member, the maximum combined
leave entitlement is 26 weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those
26 weeks. Note that in cases where the Bank employs spouses, the spouses are limited to a combined total of
12 weeks of FMLA due to the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child or to care for a
parent with a serious health condition. Additional parameters apply for spouses who work for the
Bank, so these employees should work with Human Resources to determine exactly how much time
each spouse is eligible for under FMLA, depending on the circumstances of the leave. Deﬁnitions
A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care
provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the
employee’s job, or prevents the qualiﬁed family member from participating in school or other daily
activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement includes an incapacity
of more than three full calendar days and two visits to a health care provider or one visit to a health
care provider and a continuing regimen of care; an incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal
visits, a chronic condition, or permanent or long-term conditions; or absences due to multiple
treatments. Other situations may meet the deﬁnition of continuing treatment. A covered service member is a customer or veteran of the Armed Forces, including the National
Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in
outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. The term serious injury or illness means an injury or illness incurred by the customer in the line of
duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the customer medically unﬁt to
perform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating or one that existed before the
beginning of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty. With
regard to veterans, the injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed
veteran status. Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:
+ birth of a child, or to care for a newly-born child (up to 12 weeks);
+ placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care (up to 12 weeks);

+ to care for an immediate family member (employee’s spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health
condition (up to 12 weeks);

+ because of the employee’s serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform
the employee’s job (up to 12 weeks);

+ to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness related to certain types of
military service (up to 26 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or

weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a covered service member, the maximum combined
leave entitlement is 26 weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those
26 weeks. Note that in cases where the Bank employs spouses, the spouses are limited to a combined total of
12 weeks of FMLA due to the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child or to care for a
parent with a serious health condition. Additional parameters apply for spouses who work for the
Bank, so these employees should work with Human Resources to determine exactly how much time
each spouse is eligible for under FMLA, depending on the circumstances of the leave. Definitions

A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care
provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the
employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily

Qualifying exigencies include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging
alternative childcare, making ﬁnancial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and
recuperation, counseling, and post-deployment debrieﬁngs. Identifying the 12-Month Period
The 12-month period in which 12 weeks of leave may be taken is a rolling 12-month period measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA leave for the birth or placement
of a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12 months of the birth or placement. Using Leave
Eligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks
of time), or by reducing the normal work schedule when medically necessary for the serious health
condition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a covered service member,
their injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for
military qualifying exigencies. Intermittent leave is not permitted for the birth of a child, to care for a
newly born child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Employees who require
intermittent or reduced-schedule leave must try to schedule their leave so that it will not unduly
disrupt the Bank's operations. Use of Accrued Paid Leave
To the extent you have any accrued PTO and/or sick time, you are required to use it concurrently
with your FMLA leave. Beneﬁts received under other income replacement programs, such as disability or workers’ compensation also run concurrently with FMLA and do not extend the period of
FMLA. However, employees may be able to supplement these paid beneﬁts with available vacation
and/or sick, to a maximum of 100% of their regular base pay for the week. Maintenance of Health Beneﬁts
If you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, the Bank will maintain coverage during
your FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. You must make arrangements
to pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave prior to beginning leave, unless the need
for leave in unforeseeable, in which case you must make arrangements as soon as possible. In some
instances, the Bank may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other beneﬁts for
you and your family. Notice and Medical Certiﬁcation
When seeking FMLA leave, you are required to provide:

- suﬃcient information and documentation for us to determine if the requested leave qualiﬁes for
 FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. You must also inform the
 bank if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certiﬁed;

- if the need for leave is foreseeable, this information must be provided 30 days in advance of the
 anticipated beginning date of the leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, this information
 must be provided as soon as is practicable and in compliance with the bank’s normal call-in
 procedures, absent unusual circumstances;

- medical certiﬁcation supporting the need for leave due to a serious health condition aﬀecting you

 treated in accordance with our standard leave of absence and attendance policies, subjecting you
 to discipline up to and including termination. Second or third medical opinions and periodic
 re-certiﬁcations may also be required;

Qualifying exigencies include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging
alternative childcare, making financial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and
recuperation, counseling, and post-deployment debriefings. Identifying the 12-Month Period

The 12-month period in which 12 weeks of leave may be taken is a rolling 12-month period measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA leave for the birth or placement
of a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12 months of the birth or placement. Using Leave

Eligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks
of time), or by reducing the normal work schedule when medically necessary for the serious health
condition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a covered service member,
their injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for
military qualifying exigencies. Intermittent leave is not permitted for the birth of a child, to care for a
newly born child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Employees who require
intermittent or reduced-schedule leave must try to schedule their leave so that it will not unduly
disrupt the Bank's operations. Use of Accrued Paid Leave

To the extent you have any accrued PTO and/or sick time, you are required to use it concurrently
with your FMLA leave. Benefits received under other income replacement programs, such as disability or workers’ compensation also run concurrently with FMLA and do not extend the period of
FMLA. However, employees may be able to supplement these paid benefits with available vacation
and/or sick, to a maximum of 100% of their regular base pay for the week. Maintenance of Health Benefits

If you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, the Bank will maintain coverage during
your FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. You must make arrangements
to pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave prior to beginning leave, unless the need
for leave in unforeseeable, in which case you must make arrangements as soon as possible. In some
instances, the Bank may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other benefits for
you and your family. Notice and Medical Certification
When seeking FMLA leave, you are required to provide:

+ sufficient information and documentation for us to determine if the requested leave qualifies for
FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. You must also inform the
bank if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified;

+ if the need for leave is foreseeable, this information must be provided 30 days in advance of the
anticipated beginning date of the leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, this information
must be provided as soon as is practicable and in compliance with the bank’s normal call-in
procedures, absent unusual circumstances;

+ medical certification supporting the need for leave due to a serious health condition affecting you
or an immediate family member within 15 calendar days of the bank’s request to provide the
certification. If you fail to do so, we may delay the commencement of your leave, withdraw any
designation of FMLA leave or deny the leave, in which case your leave of absence would be
treated in accordance with our standard leave of absence and attendance policies, subjecting you
to discipline up to and including termination. Second or third medical opinions and periodic
re-certifications may also be required;

- periodic reports as deemed appropriate by the bank during the leave regarding your status and
 intent to return to work; and

- medical certiﬁcation of ﬁtness for duty before returning to work, if the leave was due to your serious
 health condition. The bank will require this certiﬁcation to address whether you can perform the
 essential functions of your position. Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employer Responsibilities

the bank will notify the employee. Job Restoration
Upon returning from FMLA leave, eligible employees will typically be restored to their original job or to
an equivalent job with equivalent pay, beneﬁts, and other employment terms and conditions. Exemption for Key Employees

Further, FMLA does not aﬀect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, nor does it
supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or
medical leave rights. Limited Nature of This Policy
This policy should not be construed to confer any express or implied contractual relationship or
rights to any employee not expressly provided for by FMLA. The Bank reserves the right to modify
this or any other policy as necessary, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law. State or
local leave laws may also apply. Military-Related Federal FMLA Leave
FMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related
medical and nonmedical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The ﬁrst is
Military Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is
detailed below. Military Caregiver Leave
Unpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family
members who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty. The family member must be a “covered service member,” which means: (1) a current customer or
veteran of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Reserves, (2) who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy; or, in the case of a veteran, who was a current customer of the Armed
Forces, National Guard or Reserves within ﬁve years prior to the treatment for which an eligible
employee requests leave; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, (3) for a serious injury or illness that may render a current customer medically unﬁt to
perform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating. Military Caregiver Leave is not
available to care for service members on the permanent disability retired list. To be eligible for Military Caregiver Leave, the employee must be a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or
next of kin of the covered service member. Next of kin means the nearest blood relative of the
service member, other than the service member’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following
order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by
court decree or statutory provisions; brothers and sisters; grandparents; aunts and uncles; and ﬁrst
cousins; unless the service member has speciﬁcally designated in writing another blood relative as
his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of Military Caregiver Leave. The employee must also
meet all other eligibility standards as set forth within this FMLA policy. An eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave to care for a covered
service member in a single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the ﬁrst day
leave is taken to care for a covered service member and ends 12 months thereafter, regardless of
the method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an employee
does not exhaust his or her 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this single 12-month
period, the remainder is forfeited. Military Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each service member. Consequently, an
eligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every covered service
member, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same covered service member."

eligible. Which Short-Term Disabilities are Eligible? Home Bank will grant paid short-term disability leave to eligible employees for disabilities resulting
from personal illness or accidents which preclude the employee from performing the essential
functions of his or her position, produce signiﬁcant physical symptoms and necessitate hospital care
or continuing physician care

Any employee who is seeking a paid short-term disability leave of absence must submit a request in
writing for such leave to HR at least 30 days prior to the beginning of such leave. In the event the
employee has less than 30 days’ notice of an expected short-term disability leave of absence, notice
should be given as soon as possible. Failure to provide complete and timely medical certiﬁcation will
result in delay of beneﬁts under this policy. If the medical certiﬁcation by the employee’s physician is
questionable, Home Bank reserves the right to contact the physician in order to clarify any unclear or
doubtful diagnosis or treatment regimen. If the employee’s physician chooses to remain unavailable
to speak with a representative of Home Bank regarding the medical certiﬁcation, Home Bank

extended leave, sick or paid time oﬀ days. After the ﬁve (5) week period and until the 90th calendar
day of disability, the duration of paid beneﬁts is based on oﬃcer status and years of service as
follows:

Non-oﬃcer, Bank Oﬃcer, Sr. Bank Oﬃcer and Assistant Vice Presidents:
5 years or less of service - 5 weeks at 80% pay
6 or more years of service - 5 weeks + 1 week at 80% of the employee’s regular base salary for each

eligible for this coverage on the ﬁrst of the month following date of hire. Beneﬁts under the Long-Term Disability Plan are determined at the sole discretion of the insurance
carrier. For speciﬁc information concerning limitations and beneﬁt details, you should refer to your
Long-Term Disability summary plan document. Which Employees Are Eligible? Full-time employees who have completed 12 months of uninterrupted full-time employment are
eligible. Which Short-Term Disabilities are Eligible? Home Bank will grant paid short-term disability leave to eligible employees for disabilities resulting
from personal illness or accidents which preclude the employee from performing the essential
functions of his or her position, produce significant physical symptoms and necessitate hospital care
or continuing physician care

Any employee who is seeking a paid short-term disability leave of absence must submit a request in
writing for such leave to HR at least 30 days prior to the beginning of such leave. In the event the
employee has less than 30 days’ notice of an expected short-term disability leave of absence, notice
should be given as soon as possible. Failure to provide complete and timely medical certification will
result in delay of benefits under this policy. If the medical certification by the employee’s physician is
questionable, Home Bank reserves the right to contact the physician in order to clarify any unclear or
doubtful diagnosis or treatment regimen. If the employee’s physician chooses to remain unavailable
to speak with a representative of Home Bank regarding the medical certification, Home Bank
reserves the right to delay the commencement or continuation of paid leave until all questions are
answered to Home Bank’s satisfaction. There is a five day waiting period for benefits during which you will be required to use any available
extended leave, sick or paid time off days. After the five (5) week period and until the 90th calendar
day of disability, the duration of paid benefits is based on officer status and years of service as
follows:

Non-officer, Bank Officer, Sr. Bank Officer and Assistant Vice Presidents:

5 years or less of service - 5 weeks at 80% pay

6 or more years of service - 5 weeks + 1 week at 80% of the employee’s regular base salary for each
completed year of service over 5 years with benefits stopping upon the
90th calendar day of the disability

Vice President and above:

80% of regular base pay until 90th calendar day of the disability. An employee who is still disabled
after 90 calendar days may be eligible for long-term disability benefits. Please refer to the section on
and summary plan description for Long-term Disability benefits. After five weeks, if medically necessary, an employee can use accrued PTO, sick or extended leave
up until the 90th calendar day in order to stay in a paid status. Employees can also use accrued PTO,
sick or extended leave to cover the 20% of unpaid time."

Leaves of Absence (Non-FMLA)
We recognize that employees may need to request a leave of absence for medical, family, or
personal reasons when they are not eligible for a federal or state-speciﬁc leave right, or another
Home Bank leave policy. During any leave, an employee will be required to use any earned time oﬀ beneﬁts before taking the
time as unpaid, unless the employee’s leave is covered under another income replacement beneﬁt,
such as workers’ compensation. In these cases, to the extent the income replacement beneﬁts
permit, the employee may use earned but unused time oﬀ beneﬁts to supplement these other
payments, as long as the employee’s total wages for the week do not exceed 100% of the
employee’s regular base rate of pay. Leaves fall into one of three categories:

- Medical leave is for any illness or injury of the employee, including pregnancy and childbirth. - Family leave includes caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or caring for an immediate
family member with a serious illness or injury. For purposes of this policy, immediate family members
are deﬁned as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner, child, or parent. - Personal leave is for all other requests not included under medical or family leave or other Bank,
federal, or state leave law and is granted under limited circumstances at the sole discretion of Home
Bank’s management, based on various factors, including the general performance record of the
employee and the operating needs of the Bank. If the leave is for a medical or family related reason, the leave will be considered in accordance with
any legal requirements in addition to this policy. To the extent permitted by law, the need for more
than one type of leave may be combined, and leaves will run concurrently with any other leaves. Employees must provide their supervisor and Human Resources notice of the need for leave as far
in advance as is practicable. Requests must include documented proof of the need for leave, the
date leave is to begin and the expected date of return. Leave requests for the employee’s or an
immediate family member’s illness or injury must accompany a physician’s documentation and
statement supporting the need for leave. Depending on the nature of the leaves, additional
documentation may be required. When leave is due to the employee’s own illness or injury, Home Bank reserves the right to have the
employee examined by a physician of the Bank’s choosing and at the Bank’s expense to support the
need for leave. Employees may also be required to provide periodic physician documentation during
their leave to support the need for continued leave in addition to a physician’s certiﬁcation
permitting them to return to work at the completion of the leave period. Employees may also be
required to maintain contact with their supervisor during a leave at designated intervals about their
status and tentative return to work plans. While on leave, Home Bank will pay for its portion of the employee’s insurance premiums for the
length of time of approved leave. The employee is required to make payment arrangements with the
Bank for their portion. Continuation of beneﬁts beyond this period is at the employee’s expense
through COBRA. Time oﬀ beneﬁts and any other Bank sponsored beneﬁts do not accrue during
unpaid leaves. Leaves of Absence (Non-FMLA)

We recognize that circumstances may occasionally prevent an employee from returning to work as
planned. These situations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the law, to
determine if approval of additional leave time can be granted. We will attempt to reinstate employees returning from a leave to their same or similar position;
however, depending on the nature and length of the leave, there may not be a guarantee that we
will be able to return an employee to any position upon completion of their leave. In making these

Our Commitment to Safety
Protecting the safety of our employees and customers is one of our most important duties. Everyone has the opportunity and responsibility to contribute to a safe work environment by using
commonsense rules and safe practices and by notifying Facilities when health or safety issues are
present. Everyone is encouraged to partner with Facilities to ensure maximum safety for all. Everyone is scheduled to receive safety and robbery training and is required to attend any training
session provided by Home Bank that is related to workplace safety and security. In the event of an emergency, notify the appropriate emergency personnel by dialing 9 for an
outside line, then dial 911 to activate the medical emergency services. All accidents must be reported
to Facilities and HR. You can report accidents through OneNet>Knowledge>Forms>Facilities>
Accident/Incident Report Form. Failure to report any accidents may lead to disciplinary action up to
termination. Additionally, notify management of any emergency situation, including accidents,
medical situations, threats of violence, etc., as well as any accident or injury of a visitor on the
property. Workplace Violence
We are committed to providing a safe workplace. We do not tolerate violent behavior whether committed by or against an employee. Violent or threating behavior may take many forms, including
physical acts, oral or written statements, email messages, phone calls, or gestures and expressions. Examples include, but are not limited to, intimidation, bullying, threats, physical attacks, property
damage, or other direct or indirect conduct that threatens personal safety or property or could be
interpreted as an intent to cause harm to person(s) or property. Even casual remarks, joking,
horseplay, and unintentional conduct may violate this policy and will be taken seriously."

other individual, or you have reason to believe a threat may exist, immediately report it to an
available member of management or HR. Contact 911 for threats of immediate harm. Do not
attempt to intervene with a potentially violent individual. Home Bank as the property owner reserves the right to prohibit employees from carrying any
weapons on the premises. The CEO and/or Security Oﬃcer may grant the authorization to carry a
weapon in cases where job descriptions or circumstances warrant. Additionally, in accordance with
our Internal Investigations and Searches procedures, Home Bank reserves the right to conduct
searches for weapons on bank property at any time. Any violations may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination. Workers’ Compensation
We provide workers’ compensation insurance for all employees in accordance with applicable law. Since workers’ compensation wage beneﬁts generally do not cover full salary, accrued paid time oﬀ
may be used to make up the diﬀerence between your beneﬁts and your regular base rate of pay. Once all paid time oﬀ is used up, you will receive only workers’ compensation beneﬁts. Workers’

growth of the organization. Therefore, a compensation philosophy has been adopted that ensures all team members a
competitive compensation package based upon the type of work they do and how well they do it. This philosophy enables Old National to provide its entire workforce, from non-exempt team members to executive
officers, with competitive base pay and opportunities for additional financial rewards based on performance that

Job Documentation and Evaluation
Job Documentation and Evaluation is the systematic process for obtaining important and relevant information about
each distinct role in the organization. The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of
every job. These include:

Essential Duties and Responsibilities
- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities
- Dimensional Data
- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities
- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities

The goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job
responsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to
identify the appropriate career level for the position. Pay Ranges
Each career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range
minimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and
performance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job’s pay range. The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the
quality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member’s pay closer
to the midpoint of the job’s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of
the preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career
levels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels. The maximum of a salary range represents the highest possible value of the job. Team members generally will not
receive increases beyond the maximum of their current job grade. Please contact HR Shared Services for further
information. Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest can harm the Company when someone’s outside interest or relationship interferes, or appears to
interfere, with their ability to make decisions and act in the best interest of Old National. We recognize our team
members have a broad range of personal and community interests and involvement and we strive to find the right
balance between supporting those pursuits and protecting the reputation, brand, and financial success of the
Company. In some cases, the mere potential for conflict or the appearance of a conflict can be a problem, therefore,
team members should avoid situations which affect their ability to be objective and impartial or their loyalties may
become divided. Old National recognizes not all conflicts of interest present a problem, and the Company seeks to
identify and manage all actual and potential conflicts of interest with integrity and transparency. » Learn more about Old National’s Conflict of Interest Policy

Alternative Work Schedules
It’s not always easy to create a fit between work schedules with the other responsibilities in our lives. Old National is a
Work/Life company, and that means that we are committed to, whenever possible, working with our team members to
achieve a fit that ensures that both work duties and other responsibilities are fulfilled. Alternative Work Schedules are a part of this commitment. Although not every position may be conducive to alternative
work arrangements, managers will review each situation individually to meet team member needs while maintaining
adequate staffing levels and providing superior customer service. Alternative work arrangements include, but are not
limited to, compressed work weeks, part-time hours, job sharing, reduced and/or flex hours. While these options are
not an entitlement, when managers and team members work together, they can turn a challenge into a true win-win
situation. If you encounter a situation that leads you to believe that an Alternative Work Schedule would meet your needs, you
should carefully consider how it will impact your department and be prepared with possible solutions when you meet
with your manager to request the Alternative Work Schedule. More information regarding Alternative Work Schedules, including the request form can be found in MyHR."

Team members taking leave intermittently must promptly contact UNUM, our leave administrator, when they miss work
due to their approved leave. Although a team member is never required to “make-up” time missed due to a leave, the

work week as the original time missed and does not need to be reported to Unum. Team members with approved intermittent absences will be paid using their paid time off (PTO). All available PTO
must be used prior to being unpaid. Exempt team members that exhaust their PTO should open a case in MyHR so
their payroll can be adjusted accordingly. Long-Term Disability
Old National provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits to eligible full-time team members who are unable to work

Team members taking leave intermittently must promptly contact UNUM, our leave administrator, when they miss work
due to their approved leave. Although a team member is never required to “make-up” time missed due to a leave, the
team member may choose to do so with prior supervisor approval. Any “make-up” time must occur during the same
work week as the original time missed and does not need to be reported to Unum. Team members with approved intermittent absences will be paid using their paid time off (PTO). All available PTO
must be used prior to being unpaid. Exempt team members that exhaust their PTO should open a case in MyHR so
their payroll can be adjusted accordingly. Long-Term Disability

Old National provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits to eligible full-time team members who are unable to work
because of a long-term qualifying medical disability. If a disability lasts longer than 26 weeks, Short-Term Disability

member whose spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty, or are called to covered active-duty status,
to take leave to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short
notice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities. Paid military exigency leave may also
qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection. Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for
pay purposes. MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE
Old National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team
member to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (“nearest blood
relative”) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state
law protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave

condition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave. All team members are eligible to request
personal leave. One personal leave may be granted for a period of up to 30 consecutive calendar days every two years per supervisor
approval. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single
extension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be
evaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the
proposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)
before going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it
is available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot
guarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. Worker’s Compensation Insurance
Old National provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This
program covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,
surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers’ compensation insurance

injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible team member to qualify for

compensation is paid to all non-exempt team members in accordance with federal and state, wage, and hour
restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time off for holidays, PTO, or any leave of absence will
not be considered hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. Overtime must always be approved in advance by the team member’s supervisor. However, if a non-exempt team

Severance Pay
Old National provides severance pay to eligible team members whose employment is terminated because of a job
elimination. The purpose of severance pay is to minimize the financial hardship that might occur when team members
experience job loss through no fault of their own. Severance benefits and the eligibility requirements are detailed in the
Severance Pay Summary Plan Description. Timekeeping
It is the responsibility of every non-exempt team member to accurately record time worked. Federal and state laws
require Old National to keep an accurate record of time worked to calculate team member pay and benefits. Time
worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Non-exempt team members should accurately record their time worked daily. Non-exempt team members must
accurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal
period. They should also record the hours of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. Salaried nonexempt team members must accurately record any deviations to their standard schedule. Misrepresenting or falsifying timekeeping or recording time for another team member may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. It is the team member’s responsibility to enter their time to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The supervisor will
review and approve the time record before submitting it for payroll processing. A team member’s workday, in general, begins when the team member commences their job duties and ends when they
have ceased performing job duties. Team members performing opening and closing procedures are considered
“working” when these procedures begin even if part of those procedures are in the parking lot. Team members
participating in these procedures would be able to use the mobile app to clock in or out from the parking lot to capture
their accurate time worked. Those team members that are not part of opening and closing procedures may use the
mobile app to clock in when at their workstation ready to begin work or clock out when at their workstation done with
their work. Instructions and policies related to timekeeping can be found in MyHR. Note: Intranet sites are only accessible from within the Old National Network. Travel Time
Ordinary travel from home to work is not counted as hours worked. Non-exempt team members required to travel out
of town for business-related matters will be paid for all hours worked. Additionally, hours worked include time spent
traveling to or home from the out-of-town business location (e.g., in a car, in an airplane). Other time spent out of town
for business travel, such as time in hotel for overnight stays and meals, are not considered hours worked. Advances

Pay Transparency
Old National will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against team members or applicants because they
have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another team member or applicant. However,
team members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of
their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not
otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or
charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by
the employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor’s legal duty to furnish information. Your Conduct
To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members
to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this
section of the Team Member Handbook, you’ll learn what’s expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the
job as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. Absenteeism
As part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you’re
not working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. PLANNED ABSENCES
You must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the
established guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or
banking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. UNPLANNED ABSENCES
Unscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from
your manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to
suffer. If you’re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your
normal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM
Old National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your
immediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business
interruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a
member of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their
employment with Old National. Even if you have paid time off to cover several absences and you report them to your manager in a timely manner, you
may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. Your overall attendance record,
including late arrivals and early departures, is an important consideration when being reviewed for promotional
opportunities, transfers, and even salary increases. Your manager retains discretion in determining whether your
absences are excessive."

otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or
charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by
the employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish information. Your Conduct

To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members
to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this
section of the Team Member Handbook, you'll learn what's expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the
job as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. Absenteeism

As part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you're
not working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. PLANNED ABSENCES

You must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the
established guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or
banking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. UNPLANNED ABSENCES

Unscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from
your manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to
suffer. If you’re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your
normal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM

Old National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your
immediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business
interruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a
member of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their
employment with Old National. Even if you have paid time off to cover several absences and you report them to your manager in a timely manner, you
may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. Your overall attendance record,
including late arrivals and early departures, is an important consideration when being reviewed for promotional
opportunities, transfers, and even salary increases. Your manager retains discretion in determining whether your
absences are excessive. While not an exhaustive list, your manager may consider the impact of your absences on the
completion of work and/or on service levels, the frequency and length of the absences, the reasons for the absences,
the timing of your absences, etc. ---

TEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK 37

Managers are responsible for monitoring attendance-related issues on a case-by-case basis and taking corrective
action, if required. Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action. Team Member Conduct and Behavior

Each team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual
respect and trust. Our interactions with others, whether with team members, clients, vendors, or people in the
communities we serve will reflect Old National's values and the appreciation we have for each other's contribution and
perspective. In the context of this handbook, it isn't possible to list all the forms of conduct that are considered
unacceptable in the workplace. Instead, we expect team members to use good judgment and common sense in
sustaining a civil and respectful work environment."

- Failure to meet behavior and performance expectations and/or training expectations for your role. - Failure to cooperate in Company investigations of workplace misconduct. - Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct. - Sexual or other unlawful harassment. Employment with Old National is at the mutual consent of Old National and the team member, and either party may
terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. Dress Guidelines
Creating a positive first impression paves the way for establishing good relationships. Often the impression you create
is influenced by the way you present yourself, including your attire. At Old National, we follow a “dress for your day” approach. This means appropriate dress can vary from business to
casual. What is appropriate for each team member on a given day should be dictated by their role and the interaction
they expect to have with customers, fellow team members and others outside Old National on that day. Please consider your daily schedule when choosing your attire. Even if your circumstances allow for casual clothing,
please remember that your attire is a reflection on you and on Old National. Drug and Alcohol Use
It is Old National’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthy, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, team members
are required to report to work in an appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory
manner. While on Old National premises or while conducting business related activities away from Old National premises, no
team member may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The legal use of
prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair a team member’s ability to perform the essential
functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment,
and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Such violations may also have
legal consequences. Team members will be required to take an immediate alcohol and/or drug test where reasonable suspicion exists that
a team member is abusing alcohol, using illegal drugs, or using legal drugs illegally, whether on or off duty. Failure to
submit to drug testing and participation in the Employee Assistance Program may be grounds for termination. Team members with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to use the
resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these matters with their supervisor
or a Human Resources Representative to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community. Career opportunities after the assistance period will not be diminished as a result of participation in the Employee
Assistance Program. Team members with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of,
disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program. Leave may be granted if the team member agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all Old
National policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the leave will not cause
Old National any undue hardship. + Failure to meet behavior and performance expectations and/or training expectations for your role. + Failure to cooperate in Company investigations of workplace misconduct. + Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct. + Sexual or other unlawful harassment."

Corrective Action
Every team member’s contribution is important to Old National’s success. Both our external and internal clients depend
on a consistent level of excellence in their interactions with team members. The Company believes that everyone is
responsible for their performance and behavior and expects each team member to meet the expectations for their
position. And we believe that open, honest, and direct communication is critical to the success of each team member
and Old National. Our corrective action process is intended to foster team member success by identifying
unacceptable performance and the cause(s) of the unacceptable performance, agreeing on method(s) for improving
performance to an acceptable level, and preventing recurrence. In most cases, if you have a performance or behavior issue, your manager will work with you to provide appropriate
performance counseling and corrective action so that you have the opportunity to improve. However, our corrective
action process is not necessarily progressive. This means a manager does not have to use levels of corrective action
consecutively. Managers reserve the right to take the level of corrective action that is appropriate for the situation and,
if necessary, to terminate employment without implementing performance counseling and corrective action. The level of performance counseling and corrective action depends on considerations such as:
- The nature, circumstances, and severity of the issue(s)
- Timing and frequency of previous issues
- The team member’s overall performance

Corrective action options include a verbal, written or final warning, suspension, or termination of employment. Additionally, during the corrective action process, there may be times when Old National determines that it is
appropriate for you to be out of the workplace, and you may be placed on administrative leave."

Old National will maintain a work environment that is free of controlled substances and related paraphernalia, alcohol,
firearms, explosives, or other improper materials such as weapons and sexually explicit materials. Old National
prohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises. In some states, there are additional

permitting team members to perform work from home when possible. The following guidelines explain various scenarios and how the company will pay you when an emergency scenario
occurs. If your business, branch, or department closes during your working hours:
In extreme cases, when inclement weather conditions or another emergency situation develops during the day,
management may decide to close all or part of its business operations. - All team members who are instructed to leave early as a result of closed operations will be paid for their normally
 scheduled hours that day. Team members who are in a role that work can be performed remotely (home or
 another ONB location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on
 determining a remote location to work. - Team members may be asked to work on a day when their department is officially closed. In these circumstances,
 non-exempt team members who work will receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times the team member’s base
 rate of pay. Please contact HR Shared Services for assistance regarding the proper coding of the time. - In departments with flexible scheduling options, non-exempt team members should attempt to make up missed

Team members may be paid their regular pay for up to one week of emergency closure pay per calendar year if they
are unable to perform their job duties from a remote setting. If emergency closures exceed one week per year,
executive leaders will review to determine if additional emergency close pay is warranted. All emergency close pay will be recorded using the Emergency Closing (EMC) pay code for regular hours or the
Emergency Closing Shift (EMS) pay code for shift hours. Emergency Closing Pay will not count as hours worked for
overtime purposes. Please contact HR Shared Services if you have any questions concerning the above. Ergonomics

TEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK 44

The simple act of placing a sheet of paper, an aluminum can or a bottle in a recycling container is the first step in
reducing demand for the earth’s limited resources. The success of this program depends on active participation by all
of us. Team members are encouraged to make a commitment to recycle and be a part of this solution. Many Old
National locations provide special recycling receptacles to promote the separation and collection of recyclable
materials. Other simple steps include the practice of double-sided printed and moving to imaging and electronic document
storage to reduce the use of paper from the onset. If you have any questions or new ideas and suggestions for the sustainability program, please share them with a
member of the Sustainability Department. Required Training and Compliance
Old National expects its directors, officers, and team members to comply with all required regulations and training. Compliance with banking and other regulations is the responsibility of every Old National team member. Disregarding

orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristic
will not be tolerated. As an example, sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of team member misconduct that is demeaning to
another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is prohibited and protected by law. WHAT IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The
law prohibits team members, third party vendors, contractors, as well as supervisors and managers with whom team
members come into contact with from engaging in conduct prohibited by the Act. As defined by the guidelines, sexual
harassment involves: “Unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature when:

 1. Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
 2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for an employment decision
 affecting such an individual, or
 3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or
 creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.”

Examples of prohibited behavior include but are not limited to:

 - Repeated sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions. - Continued or repeated verbal abuse of a sexual nature. - Sexually related comments, jokes, or graphics. - Degrading or inappropriate comments about a team member’s appearance.

remedial action will be taken. Old National will not retaliate against a victim of sexual/unlawful harassment for requesting leave or a reasonable
accommodation regardless of whether the request was granted. If you believe you have been retaliated against, you
should immediately report it to your supervisor, a Talent Partner/Manager, the Chief Ethics Officer, the Chief People
Officer, or the Chief Legal Officer. INTERNAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURES
All complaints will be investigated in a prompt and sensitive manner. This is to encourage the reporting of any
incidents of sexual or other unlawful harassment, and to protect the reputation of any team member wrongfully
charged with sexual or other unlawful harassment. Investigations of a complaint will normally include conferring with
the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses. Every team member shall have a duty to cooperate with
the investigation. All team members are protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination
from filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation. If you believe you have been retaliated against, you should
immediately report it to your supervisor, a Talent Partner/Manager, the Chief Ethics Officer, the Chief People Officer,

Introduction

Welcome and Purpose

The Crouse Medical Practice Employee Handbook summarizes policies, procedures, benefits
and working conditions that will be followed by all employees as a condition of their employment
with Crouse Medical Practice (CMP). These documents are available in full detail to all
employees on a shared drive. Employees will be asked to affirm that they understand where to
access such detailed policies and procedures. Crouse Medical Practice strives to provide an employee-friendly environment in which goaloriented individuals thrive. Our company commitment to serving patients and providing quality
patient care is unwavering. These policies, procedures and working conditions provide a work
environment in which both patient and employee interests are served. We value our employees’ talents, skills and abilities and seek to foster an open, cooperative and
dynamic environment in which we can all excel. Crouse Medical Practice provides an
environment where employees are encouraged to bring ideas and challenges to any level of
management. This handbook contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be
comprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general
policies and procedures described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning
eligibility for a particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should
address your specific questions to the Human Resources Department. No provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical
Practice’s President, or designee. At-Will Employment Statement

Employment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an
employee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time,
for any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it
intended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will
employment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written
contract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual. Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual
right, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it
guarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for
any specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by
Crouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are
disciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to
terminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps. 1 | P a g e

Diversity and Inclusion

 Diversity creates Inclusion. Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and
 those we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be
 successful in his or her work. Diversity isall of the ways we are different as individual people - the characteristics of who
 we are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences. Our culture and values support diversity and inclusion by:

  Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team
  Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s
 and our community
  Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and
 perspectives

Employment

Americans with Disabilities Act

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or
more employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also
requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who
are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform
the essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of
individuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate
against qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,
advancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of
employment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided
without creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given
the same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and
employees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the
requested accommodations result in the following:

  A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace
 and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or
  An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company
ADA policy. 4 | P a g e

The Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including
the resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues. Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation. Employee Classification

Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as
determined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:

  Exempt - Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including
 managerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
 Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or
 part-time status.  Non-Exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards. Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these
 employees. Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their fulltime or part-time status. Employment Resignation and Termination

Termination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons
for termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your
anticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and
exempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice
(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract). Upon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with
an accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year. In the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work
force, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off
(PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be
specifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please
refer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. If you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will
assume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline
Policy #600-002. 5 | P a g e

Employment Status

FULL-TIME - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such
full-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service
have been met. PART-TIME - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be parttime and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who
work on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s
Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other
employee benefits. PER DIEM - Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of
hours. These employees are not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except legally
mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits). CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE - Employees who have a written contract with CMP that defines
the scope of their benefits with the organization. TEMPORARY - Employees engaged to work either part time or full time on Crouse Medical

not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except benefits except legally mandated
benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits). License and Certification

If your job classification requires licensure or certification, during the initial hiring process, you
must present the original copy of licensure/certification to Human Resources or an online
primary source verification must be completed prior to beginning employment with Crouse
Medical Practice. Your continued employment in that classification depends on proper maintenance of the
required licensure or certification. It is also your responsibility to notify the New York State
Education Department, Office of Professional Licensure, and/or other relevant
licensing/certification governing bodies, of things such as: name change and change of address
notification (when applicable). This will ensure you receive renewal notices in a timely manner. Prior to the expiration date, any licensed or certified employee of CMP is responsible for
renewing their license and/or certification in a timely manner. The renewed license
documentation must be provided and/or verified online through a primary source website prior to
the expiration date. If an employee fails to comply with this procedure, they will be unscheduled

Employees should notify their supervisor of the need to use bereavement leave. Within a
reasonable period of time, the employee may be required to provide verification of need, such
as an obituary. Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

As an employee of Crouse Medical Practice, you may be eligible to take unpaid family and
medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Eligible employees may take up to a
total of 12 weeks of job-protected FMLA leave within a rolling 12-month period, measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. If you have questions regarding
FMLA, please contact Human Resources. Eligibility

To be eligible for leave, you must have been employed by the Organization for at least 12
months. In the 12 months immediately preceding the beginning of the leave, you must also have
worked at least 1,250 hours to qualify for federal FMLA. FMLA may be requested for any combination of the following reasons:

  The birth of an employee’s newborn child or the placement of a child with the employee
 for adoption or foster care
  To care for the employee’s spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition
  The employee has a serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform
 the functions of their job
  A qualifying exigency that arises because the employee’s spouse, child or parent is a
 covered military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending
 call or order to covered active duty)
  To care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the employee is
 the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the service member (military
 caregiver leave) (26 weeks)

Such leaves may be taken all at once or, when medically necessary, intermittently or on a
reduced leave schedule. The need for leave must be documented by your treating health care
provider through our medical certification process. In the case where the leave is for an
employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty statement will be required in order
for you to return from a medical leave. Failure to provide the statement will result in a delay in
your return to work. If an employee is provided group health insurance, the employee is entitled
to the continuation of the group health insurance coverage during FMLA leave on the same
terms as if he or she had continued to work. If family member coverage is provided to an
employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. The employee
must continue to make any normal contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. Please contact Human Resources for additional information. 20 | P a g e

employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty statement will be required in order
for you to return from a medical leave. Failure to provide the statement will result in a delay in
your return to work. If an employee is provided group health insurance, the employee is entitled
to the continuation of the group health insurance coverage during FMLA leave on the same
terms as if he or she had continued to work. If family member coverage is provided to an
employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. The employee
must continue to make any normal contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. Please contact Human Resources for additional information. 20|Page

 serious health condition; or
  to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active
 military duty. For further information please refer to CMP’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020. Paid Time Off (PTO)

Crouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away
from work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)
program to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to
decide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule. Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:

  As vacation
  For personal business
  For periods of illness
  For religious observation
  For doctor or dental appointments
  For personal or family emergencies
  In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions

Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual

All full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO
hours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total
amount of PTO time in two equally divided “buckets” to current employees in the beginning of
the first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year. Time allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. - the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):

  Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the
 employee’s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the
 completion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires.  Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an
 exempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If
 they work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than 1
 hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the
 month following the date of hire for new hires. When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to
determine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or
with less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees

leave, and such time shall be taken only at the beginning or end of the employee’s workday as

At all company social functions, employees are responsible for behaving in a professional
manner. While alcohol may be served at company events outside of business hours, employees
should refrain from becoming intoxicated. Even at social events, employees must remember that they are representing the company and
need to ensure that they are upholding the company’s positive reputation at all times. Telephone & Cell Phone Usage

Crouse Medical Practice provides phones to employees to increase efficiency in doing
business. There are important things to consider when using company phones. Please adhere
to the following guidelines, based on the type of call you are making or receiving:

  Business phone calls - Much of our business is conducted over the phone, making our
 telephone communication extremely important. A friendly but professional telephone
 manner should always be projected.  Personal phone calls - We recognize that periodically, personal phone calls must be
 made or received during the business hours. Such calls should be held at a minimum so
 that they do not interfere with the workflow. Additionally, these calls should be made
 outside of any patient care or public area.  Personal cell phone - Unless required for your job, cell phone usage will not be allowed
 for personal calls, text messaging, surfing the Internet, receiving or responding to email,
 checking phone messages or any other purpose during business hours. Please inform
 family and friends that your cell phone will be unavailable during work hours. If there is
 an emergency family/friends should attempt to reach you by calling the office first. Cell phone calls are permitted during lunch or break times in the breakroom or
 outdoors, or in a private office, but not in the general office areas.  Voicemail - Many company telephones are also equipped with voicemail. Voicemail was
 installed to help maintain our high quality of service for patients and to increase
 efficiency throughout the office. Please be sure to check your voicemail regularly and
 respond appropriately to inquiries left via voicemail. In advance of planned absences
 (PTO days), an outgoing out-of-office message should be recorded to inform callers who
 to reach in your absence and/or your return date. For specific details, please refer to CMP’s Telephone & Cell Phone policy #600-007. Travel Reimbursement

Crouse Medical Practice will reimburse travel expenses with correct approval and authorization. All employees and physicians are required to follow the Travel Reimbursement Policy #400-009
which outlines the procedure for prior approval and authorization for reimbursement. 35 | P a g e

pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding), race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and
protected hairstyles), religion, religious creed (including observance, practice, beliefs, and
practices such as, religious dress and grooming practices), color, gender (including gender identity,
gender expression, transgender status, transitioning or perceived to be transitioning), national
origin (including physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics, marriage to or association with
persons of a national origin group, tribal affiliation, membership in or association with an
organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group, name
that is associated with a national origin group, accent, language use, immigration status,
citizenship, and other definitions under state laws), ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical
condition, genetic information, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status, union status, or
any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation. It also prohibits
harassment, disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on the perception that anyone has any
of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of
those characteristics. This policy prohibits unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical, and visual
harassment. It also prohibits retaliation of any kind against individuals who file complaints of
harassment or discrimination, or who assist in an employer investigation. Employees who violate
this policy are subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination. This policy also strictly prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined as (i) unwelcome sexual
advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s employment; or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual; or (3) such
conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual
misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of
authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. Sexual harassment includes many
forms of offensive behavior, and is not excused because the harasser is attracted to the victim of
the harassment. The following is a partial list of the types of conduct which could constitute sexual
harassment:

1. Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual
advances, invitation or comments and comments about any employee’s body or clothing, verbal
sexual propositions via notes, letters or e-mails. 2. Visual conduct, such as leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of derogatory posters,
cartoons, drawings, or gestures. 3. Physical conduct, such as assault, unwanted touching, or interference with work directed
at an employee because of the employee’s sex or other protected characteristics. Prohibited Conduct and Examples of Harassment in Violation of this Policy

this policy are subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination. This policy also strictly prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined as (i) unwelcome sexual
advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s employment; or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual; or (3) such
conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual
misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of
authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. Sexual harassment includes many
forms of offensive behavior, and is not excused because the harasser is attracted to the victim of
the harassment. The following is a partial list of the types of conduct which could constitute sexual
harassment:

1. Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual
advances, invitation or comments and comments about any employee’s body or clothing, verbal
sexual propositions via notes, letters or e-mails. 2. Visual conduct, such as leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of derogatory posters,
cartoons, drawings, or gestures. 3. Physical conduct, such as assault, unwanted touching, or interference with work directed
at an employee because of the employee’s sex or other protected characteristics. ---

4. Threats or demands to submit to sexual requests in order to keep one’s job or avoid some
other loss, and offers of job benefits in return for sexual favors. 5. Any conduct, whether intentionally harassing or not, that has the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile,
or offensive working environment. 6. Communication via electronic media of any type that includes any harassing conduct that
is prohibited by state and/or federal law, or by company policy. 7. Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances. Complaints, Investigation Procedures, Response and Corrective Action

conduct, or if you learn that another individual covered by this policy may have been the subject of
conduct prohibited under this policy, you should immediately report the situation to the Healthcare
Human Resources Department (via the HR Hotline at 833-HR4-HCSG (833-474-4274) or internal

CALL-IN REQUIREMENTS

 Reporting to work on your scheduled workdays and being on time are very important, and
excessive absences or lateness can lead to discharge. If for any reason you will not be able to work a
scheduled shift, or you will be getting to work late, you must call-in as soon as possible so that your
supervisor will have time to try to make adjustments to the schedule. Your supervisor will give you a form with specific instructions about the call-in requirements for
the facility you are working in. You must follow those instructions. If you lose that form, or never
received it, be sure to get one from your supervisor. Note that you must talk to your supervisor directly

 In most instances, overtime compensation will be calculated on the basis of the federal law
requiring payment on the basis of a 40-hour workweek, with no daily overtime rules. Each work week
begins on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday, each week independent of the other for overtime
pay. State laws and collective bargaining agreements may provide for a more favorable lower daily

SICK DAYS

 An eligible full-time employee (as defined by Company policy at each facility) will be paid for a
limited number of sick days missed due to illness. The amount of paid sick days will be based upon
continuous employment and will be determined based upon Company policy at each facility. Whether you are eligible for a paid sick day or not, the following steps must be followed
when reporting off sick:

 1. You must telephone your facility and notify your supervisor of your absence at
 least one (1) hour prior to the start of your shift. Note that you must talk to your
 supervisor directly as part of your call-in responsibilities. 2. If you are out for an extended sick period of time (i.e., absent for 5 or more
 consecutive days that you would have been scheduled to work), a doctor's note
 will be required upon returning to work. (Unless otherwise agreed with your
 supervisor, each day out sick you must follow Step 1.)

 3. Failure to provide a doctor's note upon returning to work from an extended

UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE

 Healthcare provides three types of unpaid leaves of absence, depending upon the
circumstances of the employee's need and the employee's employment status: Military
Leave, Family and Medical Leave, and Personal Leave. Each is described below. Requests for any type of unpaid leave of absence must be submitted to your supervisor at
least one (1) month in advance of the expected starting date, or as soon as reasonably possible. You will need to state the reason for the leave, the requested date of the beginning of the leave,
and the date you expect to return from the leave. Requests normally will be approved or denied
within ten (10) days of receipt of the request. Employees who have been granted unpaid leave are prohibited from working
elsewhere in any capacity that is inconsistent with the reason for their leave, without the
written permission of their supervisor. Violators may be discharged. A. MILITARY LEAVE

 Employees will be granted Military Leave in accordance with applicable law. B. FAMILYANDMEDICALLEAVE

Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid
family or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month
period. Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already
taken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,
as described below. To be eligible for a Family/Medical Leave, an employee must have worked
for the Company for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to
taking the leave, and work at a worksite with 50 or more employees located within 75 miles. Hours
worked means actual hours worked and generally does not include paid or unpaid time off. However, periods of absence from work due to or necessitated by qualifying military service are
counted towards an employee’s eligibility for FMLA leave. The “12-month period” for determining FMLA eligibility is a rolling period, measured backward
from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave."

in a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee’s sole
expense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work. If paid leave
is substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee’s portion
of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If the leave is unpaid, an employee
must pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease
for the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late. If an employee
does not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the
Company for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during
unpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or
other circumstances beyond the employee’s control. Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave

Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a
schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday. 1. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as
 “baby-bonding” leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually
 agreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be
 taken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;

 2. Leave due to an employee’s own serious health condition, to care for an employee’s
 spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service
 member relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where
 medically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;

 3. Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impending
 call to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
 intermittent or reduced work schedule. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits. Medical and Other Benefits

call to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
intermittent or reduced work schedule. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits. ---

Returning From Leave

Generally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same
position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,
subject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to
reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the
Family/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement
following Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates
if an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable
law. If leave is taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition, then the employee must
provide medical certification addressing the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will
not be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided. Legal Compliance

This policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this
policy. Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,
whether or not specifically set forth in this policy. C. PERSONAL LEAVE

Employees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a
period up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also
be requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet
the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by
employees who need a period of leave due to a ""disability"" within the meaning of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (or similar state law). Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a
request for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the
Company will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the
Company's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (and comparable state laws). An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former
position and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions
of employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal
Leave will be returned to his or her former position. Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on
a Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health
insurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND
 ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)

 HIPAA PRIVACY RULE AS IT RELATES TO OUR SERVICES

 The federal government's HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that Personal Health Information
about patients/residents is protected and kept private and secure. Under HIPAA's privacy and
information security section, it is illegal to release health information to inappropriate parties or
fail to adequately protect Personal Health Information from release. The HIPAA Privacy Rule
applies to covered entities - most health care providers - including long term care facilities
and assisted living facilities. Most health care providers do not carry out all their health care activities by themselves. Instead, they often use the services of a variety of other persons and businesses. These other
persons and businesses are called Business Associates in the HIPAA law. Business Associates
perform functions on behalf of the health care provider and are bound by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. From time to time, a Business Associate in performing its duties will come in contact with
Personal Health Information. Rules governing the use and disclosure of Personal Health
Information apply to Business Associates, as well as health care providers. Healthcare is not a Business Associate when it provides Housekeeping/Laundry/
Maintenance services. HIPAA specifically excludes entities that provide
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance services from the law because the work being performed
does not involve the use or disclosure of Personal Health Information. However, since our
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with
Personal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law. Healthcare is a Business Associate when it provides Food Services and is required to
comply with HIPAA. Food Service consists of the development of a meal plan that meets the
patients/residents dietary needs in connection with the over all medical plan developed in
conjunction with the health care facility. In meeting its responsibilities, Healthcare's Food
Service department on a regular basis comes in contact with residents'/patients' Personal
Health Information and must keep this information confidential. The HIPAA Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect individual's medical
records and other Personal Health Information.  It gives patients/residents more control over their health information.  It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.  It establishes appropriate safeguards that workers in a health care facility
 must follow to protect the privacy of health information.  It holds violators accountable. HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND

Violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule carry both civil and criminal penalties for ""wrongful
disclosure"" that can include fines and jail time in certain circumstances. Failing to protect
residents'/patients' information and records by not following our privacy and security policies may
result in disciplinary action. What Is Confidential Personal Health Information? Patients/residents expect that only the people who are caring for them will see their health
information and that it will only be used to help care for them. Confidential Personal Health
Information includes:

  Patient/Resident Identity

  Address

  Age

  Social Security Number

  Any other personal information that patients/residents are asked to provide.  Diagnosis, treatments, and medications that patients/residents may receive, and other
 observations about their conditions or past health conditions. The facility collects Personal Health Information so it can care for the patient/resident and
perform other related functions. Depending upon your job responsibilities, if you do not need to
know confidential Personal Health Information, you will not be given access to it. That means that
you should not look at medical records, either in the computer or in paper form. There are occasions when you will have access to confidential Personal Health Information. For example, if a patient/resident is placed in isolation, you may become aware of why he/she is
there or you may suspect you know why. You may see confidential Personal Health Information

Ways to Protect Confidentiality

Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:

  Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a
 resident's/patient's room.  If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information
 remember to keep it confidential.  If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the
 information desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself.  Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your
 job responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential. Food Service Employees:

  Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private
 by closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so
 that others may not overhear them.  Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have
 access to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public
 areas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor.  Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information
 and are confidential.  Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers
 logged into resident information while they are not at their workstation.  Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away
 from the view of the public or people passing by.  Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it.  Do not store Personal Health Information in common files.  Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the
 facility. Ways to Protect Confidentiality

Protecting confidentiality depends on you. You must not share information that you overhear or
see in the course of your work. Doing so is a violation of the law. When you do see or hear
information in the course of doing your job, remember that the information is confidential and you
are not allowed to repeat it or share it with others. This applies even when you no longer work at
the facility. Reporting Non-Compliance

 Employees are encouraged to report non-compliance to your immediate supervisor. If you
feel that corrective action has not been taken concerning your report, you should contact

the facility's Fire Code (generally a number or color). Locate and use the fire alarm when warranted. Determine whether you can extinguish the fire with the available fire
extinguishers and fire blankets. After being notified, the facility will take charge and notify the Fire
Department, Police Department, and Evacuation Center as necessary. The facility will coordinate its evacuation procedures, including your role, if any. ---

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

 All employees must comply with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act
regulations. Each employee will be trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment. Employees must follow operating practices that will safeguard all employees, and result in a
safe working environment and efficient operation. Any employee who is provided with safety equipment is required to wear such
equipment at all times when doing the work for which the equipment was provided. NEEDLE STICK INJURY PROGRAM

 Needle stick injuries require special handling. Healthcare has engaged Corporate
Wellness, Inc. (""CWI"") to provide a national program to include an information resource and to
administer the program. If you should incur a needle stick on the job, you need to do the
following to protect yourself:

 1. Immediately notify your supervisor of the incident. 2. Go to the nearest handwashing facility and thoroughly wash the exposed area
 with soap and warm water as quickly as possible. 3. Your supervisor will complete a Needle Stick Injury Report and fax it
 directly to CWI. Needle sticks should be reported within one (1) hour of an incident, whenever
possible. CWI is available by pager 24-hours per day, seven days a week. After receiving the
Needle Stick Injury Report, CWI will contact you and provide you with good, accurate
information about the situation. That information includes:

 1. The availability of counseling. 2. The need to be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B, or both. 3. Physician selection options. 4. Treatment options. 5. Risk of infection. 6. Prevention of transmission. 7. Recommended treatments following exposures. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

INFECTION CONTROL

 Because many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and
are more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as
sanitary an environment as possible. By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,
employees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause
infection:

 1. Direct contact with infected person. 2. Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person. 3. The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents. 4. Spread through insects. 5. Inoculation. Some Things to Remember:

 1. Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of all
 resident rooms and bathrooms. 2. All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contact
 will not do the job. 3."

 contents, ingredients, and antidote. 6. No cleaning or working around food while it is being served. 7. Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentation
 which will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution. 8. Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breeding
 grounds. 9. Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry. 10. Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination. 11. Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect any
 communicable disease. 12. Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because the
 disinfecting agents are still at work on your skin. 13. Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs. INFECTION CONTROL

SUBSTANCE ABUSE

 In order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients
and a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be
physically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. Therefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,
illegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient
manner. No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic
beverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in
Company vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the
safety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships
with its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal. Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical
treatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to
their supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another
assignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public. To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever
measures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used
at, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company
believes them to be justified and necessary."

limited to, searches of people and of personal property located at the workplace, possibly by
law enforcement authorities, as well as drug and/or alcohol tests to be conducted when there is
reasonable suspicion of substance abuse. In addition, employees who suffer, or contribute to, a
work-related accident requiring medical treatment for any employee or facility
patient/resident, will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing if it is possible that an
impaired condition could have contributed to the accident. When urinalysis and/or blood tests are requested or necessary, samples will be taken
under the supervision of an appropriate health care professional. The searches and drug tests
will not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit
will result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination. Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily
seek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require
management referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered
by your medical insurance program. Successful treatment will be viewed positively. However,
participation in a treatment program will not prevent normal disciplinary action for a violation
which may have already occurred, nor will it relieve an employee of the responsibility to

Schedules
For purposes of scheduling and pay, the work week begins on Sunday. Your department head
will show you the location of your department bulletin board and the place where work
schedules are posted. Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the work schedule and to report ready to
work, on time. Changes to the schedule may be necessary from time to time. Although an employee is not
required to come in on their day off, your cooperation is appreciated. Working as a team means
that you will cover for a sick employee, knowing that perhaps the situation will be reversed in
the future and that employee will cover for you. If personal circumstances require it, you may request a schedule change. It is your responsibility
to arrange a fill-in for the shift(s) you will miss. The replacement must be from the same
department and requires at least 24-hour advance notice to your department head. Management
has the right to refuse such a change if it causes the replacement to qualify for overtime or
otherwise creates a hardship to the replacement or the department operation. This provision
does not apply to Bereavement leave, Jury Duty, the Family & Medical Leave Act, or scheduled
Military Leave. Remember: It is your responsibility to know and follow your schedule. Overtime
Schedules are determined by the GM or department heads on a weekly basis and employees
should clock in and out according to that schedule. All overtime is to be approved by the
department head or GM prior to the employee working beyond their scheduled time. Overtime
will be paid at the rate of time and a half for hours exceeding 40 between Sunday at 12:01 a.m. and Saturday at 12:00 midnight. Overtime hours will be paid for only once. In no case will there be any pyramiding of overtime

followed for each day of absence. Failure to notify management of an expected absence may be
considered a no-call, no-show situation and will result in a warning notice and counseling on

shift, at a time and place authorized by your department head. Employees on their break are
required to remain on the premises and to perform such duties as may be necessary from time to
time. A thirty-minute lunch break will be allowed during each eight-hour shift, taking place
approximately after half the shift has been completed. Employees are required to punch out for
their half-hour break. Employee Travel and Reimbursement
Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with approved
travel on behalf of the company. Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses and
exercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety. If a circumstance arises that is not
specifically covered in the travel policies, the most conservative course of action should be
adopted. Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned travel is
eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Upon completion of the trip, and
within 30 days, the traveler must submit a Travel Reimbursement Form and supporting
documentation to obtain reimbursement of expenses. Exempt employees will be paid their regular salary for weeks in which they travel. Nonexempt
employees will be paid for travel time in accordance with federal and state wage payment laws. If an employee misses three or more consecutive days because of illness, a written notification
from a physician describing the reason for the illness and absence may be required. This
notification must be submitted before the employee is allowed to return to work to ensure the
employee's health is adequate to perform work duties. If an employee is going to be late for a shift, it is their responsibility to call his/her department
head or supervisor as soon as is known, but in any event at least two hours before the scheduled
starting time. The employee must specify the time he/she may be expected to arrive for work. In
such event, the manager may decide to cancel the employee's shift, at his/her discretion. If you are unable to speak directly to your department head to report that you will be late or sick,
you must leave a message. Within two hours after your start time, you must call back and speak
with your department head or GM

Safety Standards
Accident prevention is one of the most vital concerns, in fact, safety is a prerequisite to
continued employment. It is the intent of management to afford you a safe and productive place
in which to work. Toward this end, all employees are expected to be familiar with and to follow
basic rules of safety. Accidents are usually caused by carelessness or neglect on the part of individuals. Fatigue and a
rush to complete any given task also contribute to accidents. Be aware of any tendencies in
these regards and remember that safety is the priority. We also advise every employee to take
note of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of
your training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct
any unsafe condition or practice. You are to report to your supervisor immediately any situation
which appears unsafe to you and that you cannot correct yourself. ""Safety consciousness"" are key words each of us must remember at all times. Employees with
poor safety records are a hazard to all of us, and are subject to dismissal. While most safety
precautions are simply a matter of common sense and good housekeeping, we have developed a
safety notebook which is available in your department. It is your responsibility to read the
notebook and become familiar with proper safety procedures. Use of Equipment
Employees are not to work with any equipment or machinery which they have not been properly
trained on. Material Safety Data Sheets (M.S.D.S.)

Security is vital to the property. It is everyone's responsibility to take precautions in order to
prevent theft and to ensure the safety of our guests and fellow employees. There are many ways
to make this property a safer place:

 - Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable,
 do not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the
 person if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say
something like, ""Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need
help, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), ""Are you a guest
here?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a
legitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better
to err on the side of caution. - Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. - Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. - Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting
 information about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General
 Manager. - Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may
 offer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor. - Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or
 department. - Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,
 they should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel
 employee. If no answer, they should then crack the door open slightly and repeat their
 identification. - Under no circumstances are any hotel keys to leave the property. - Use of the guest rooms for personal use is strictly prohibited. Fire Procedures

The Hotel reserves the right to inspect all portions of its premises for drugs, alcohol or other
contraband. All employees, contract employees and visitors may be asked to cooperate in
inspections of their persons, work areas, property, and/or living quarters that might conceal a
drug, alcohol or other contraband. Employees who possess such contraband or refuse to
cooperate in such inspections are subject to appropriate discipline up to and including
termination. Workplace Violence

The Hotel is committed to providing a violence-free workplace for its employees and a safe hotel
for its guests. Each employee is responsible to ensure that the premises are safe for both
employees and guests. ---

## Page 19

If an employee becomes aware of any actual violence, imminent violence, or threat of imminent
violence, obtaining emergency assistance must be a matter of first priority. The employee should
immediately contact local law enforcement authorities by dialing 911. Immediately after
contacting the law enforcement authorities for emergency assistance, the employee must report
the incident to the General Manager or Company President immediately. Employees may report
any incidents of violence or threats of violence without fear of reprisal or any kind. Employees who become aware of any threats of workplace violence must report the threats
immediately to the GM or President who will consult with the appropriate resources in order to
complete an assessment of the incident and the surrounding circumstances. In cases where it is determined that an employee has violated this policy by threatening another
individual with violence or engaging in violent behavior, management will determine the
appropriate corrective action, if any, including whether disciplinary action is warranted. If it is
determined that a threat of violence was made or actual violence has occurred, disciplinary
action will be imposed, up to and possibly including immediate termination and/or contacting
local authorities. In situations where it is found appropriate to do so, an individual who violates
this policy may be required to obtain counseling or other available assistance. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

Discipline
Every employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by existing rules
and policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/her duties to the best of
his/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her job description or as otherwise
established. When policies and procedures are not being followed, it is the responsibility of your department
head or the general manager to correct the situation. This will take the form of
coaching/counseling; or more formal verbal and/or written warnings. The Hotel reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending on the facts of
each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching,
counseling and/or training; the employee's work record; and the impact the conduct and
performance issues have on our organization. Initially, when an employee displays unacceptable behavior or his/her performance is not
meeting the job requirements, the employee will be made aware of the situation and be given an
opportunity to correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time. In some cases, this initial
contact may include a verbal warning. A verbal warning will occur if previous coaching has not corrected the problem or if the initial
issue is sufficiently serious. The warning will be noted in the employee's personnel records. A written warning is given when your department head or the general manager believes that an
offense is sufficiently serious or when a verbal warning has proven insufficient."

intent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,

 conflict of interest by compromising any of the following:
 a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more ""senior"" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to
communicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject
that responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral
reassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for
the purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to
prudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior"" positions. There is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In
that event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel. Guest Privacy
Employees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on

Under no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation
unless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Leaving Property during Work Hours
It is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to
conduct personal business. The department head is responsible for maintaining proper staffing at
all times, so if it is necessary to leave the property at any time during work hours, the employee
must do the following:

 1. Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property. 2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning. 3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns. Lost and Found
When an employee finds a lost and found item, they should turn it in to the designated lost and
found location (usually the Front Desk or the Housekeeping Department) as soon as possible. All
items turned in are logged and maintained for a period of time, during which time we will
attempt to locate the rightful owner. Failure to turn in lost and found articles may be cause for
dismissal. Personal Phone Calls and Visitors
Hotel telephones are for business use only. Personal cell phones or other mobile devices may not be used during working hours, except in
the case of an incoming call for an emergency or other urgent situation. Anyone wishing to visit an employee on the job must contact the front desk, who may contact
the employee or department head. If available, the employee may meet his/her visitor in the
lobby or other public area. Visitors will not be permitted in work areas or guest rooms. Nonemployees may be allowed to visit employee areas only with prior approval of management
or as part of a company-sponsored program. These visits should not disrupt workflow. An
employee must accompany the nonemployee at all times. Former employees are not permitted
onto company property except for official company business. Smoking
Smoking is permitted only in designated areas. Your department head will show you these
areas. Transfer/Promotion
Whenever possible, job vacancies will be filled by transfer or promotion from within, by
employees who meet the requirements for the job involved. Transfers/promotions will be based
upon the skill and ability of the employee under consideration to perform the job in question. Normally, an employee should be in a position for at least six months before applying for a
transfer or promotion. Under no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation
unless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Leaving Property during Work Hours

It is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to
conduct personal business. The department head is responsible for maintaining proper staffing at
all times, so if it is necessary to leave the property at any time during work hours, the employee
must do the following:

1. Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property. 2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning. 3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns. Lost and Found

When an employee finds a lost and found item, they should turn it in to the designated lost and
found location (usually the Front Desk or the Housekeeping Department) as soon as possible. All
items turned in are logged and maintained for a period of time, during which time we will
attempt to locate the rightful owner."
Hospitality,General Business,handbook,Alta Peruvian Lodge,HARASSMENT,will|harassment|sexual|employee|policy,2025-11-18T19:09:41.291008,1008,"All
items turned in are logged and maintained for a period of time, during which time we will
attempt to locate the rightful owner. Failure to turn in lost and found articles may be cause for
dismissal. Personal Phone Calls and Visitors
Hotel telephones are for business use only. Personal cell phones or other mobile devices may not be used during working hours, except in
the case of an incoming call for an emergency or other urgent situation. Anyone wishing to visit an employee on the job must contact the front desk, who may contact
the employee or department head. If available, the employee may meet his/her visitor in the
lobby or other public area. Visitors will not be permitted in work areas or guest rooms. Nonemployees may be allowed to visit employee areas only with prior approval of management
or as part of a company-sponsored program. These visits should not disrupt workflow. An
employee must accompany the nonemployee at all times. Former employees are not permitted
onto company property except for official company business. Smoking
Smoking is permitted only in designated areas. Your department head will show you these
areas. Transfer/Promotion

Whenever possible, job vacancies will be filled by transfer or promotion from within, by
employees who meet the requirements for the job involved. Transfers/promotions will be based
upon the skill and ability of the employee under consideration to perform the job in question. Normally, an employee should be in a position for at least six months before applying for a
transfer or promotion. ---

HOTEL NON-HARASSMENT POLICY

The Hotel strives to maintain an environment where all associates will work free from
harassment. The Company will not tolerate harassment of any type. Harassment is any offensive, unwelcome physical or verbal behavior, including but not limited
to, comments or conduct related to a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, disability or veteran status. Sexual harassment, which is unwelcome sexual
advances or other sexual behavior, is also prohibited as set forth in the Hotel’s Policy against
Sexual Harassment. Any employee who is subjected to harassment should report all such incidents directly to
management. A Confidential Report of Harassment is available for employee use. Upon
receiving a harassment complaint, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be conducted
and, if warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken. However, no disciplinary action
will be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts. No employee will suffer retaliation or
any form of punishment for voicing a valid concern. Bullying
The Hotel defines bullying as “repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether
verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the
place of work and/or in the course of employment.” Such behavior violates the company’s intent
that all employees will be treated with dignity and respect. The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors, managers
and executives, that the company will not tolerate bullying behavior. Employees found in
violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination. HOTEL POLICY AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT

The Hotel’s Policy against Sexual Harassment prohibits sexual harassment by employees
(management or non-management) wherever work or work related activities are being
performed. Under the policy, a manager cannot state, suggest or imply that an employee's submission to or
rejection of sexual advances will in any way influence any personnel decision regarding that
employee's employment, wages, advancement, assigned duties, schedule, or any other condition
of employment. Other physical or verbal conduct that creates a sexually offensive work place, whether
committed by management or non-management employees, is also prohibited. Examples of this

Introduction

This handbook is designed to acquaint you with Buchheit and provide you with information about working
conditions, team member benefits, and some of the policies that affect you. You should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. The Handbook describes
many of your responsibilities as a team member and outlines the programs we have developed to benefit our
team members. One of our objectives at Buchheit is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both
personal and professional growth. No team member handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about every one of our policies. Further, there may be situations where the need arises for us to revise, add, or cancel policies. Therefore,
Buchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The
only exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-atwill policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will
notify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur. Purpose of Handbook

The contents of this handbook are not intended to create a contract between Buchheit and any or all of its
team members. Rather, this handbook is provided only for the purpose of providing general information
about the company and its policies. Buchheit reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change any or all such plans, policies or
procedures, in whole or in part, anytime with or without notice. Nothing herein is intended to create any type
of contract or guarantee of continued employment. Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be
discontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice. The Buchheit Story

In 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local
farmers. No superhighways, no GPS units - just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family. To make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back
home had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy’s efforts were an immediate hit, and
Buchheit Trucking was born. Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with
a network connecting continents around the globe. The Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores
offer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest."

there on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it “Rudy’s way.” And no
matter how much farther down the road we go, we’ll never lose sight of it. 7 | P a g e

Buchheit Trucking was born. Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with
a network connecting continents around the globe. The Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores
offer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest. Yet in spite of our success, we’ ve never forgotten the simple principles that drove Rudy back in 1934: get it
there on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it “Rudy’s way.” And no

matter how much farther down the road we go, we’ll never lose sight of it. 7|Page

Customer Relations

Customers are Buchheit's most valuable assets. Each team member represents Buchheit to our Customers
and the public. The way we do our jobs presents an image of our entire organization. Customers judge us by
how they are treated each time they have contact with us. Therefore, one of our top business priorities is to
assist any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,
and prompt in the attention you give to customers. This applies to internal, as well as external, customers. Buchheit will provide customer relations and services training to all team members who have extensive
customer contact. If a customer wishes to make a specific comment or complaint, you should direct that
person to the Manager on Duty for appropriate action. Remember that your contacts with the public in
person, over the telephone, and through all your communications reflect, not only on you, but on Buchheit as
a whole. Positive customer relations will not only enhance the public's image of Buchheit, but also pay off in
greater customer loyalty and increased sales and profit. Buchheit Logistics, Our Promise

At Buchheit, we understand our customers have a choice when it comes to a logistics partner."

A Letter from Rudy

I am pleased that you have decided to join us here at Buchheit! A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to
make it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself
have taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today. I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the
depression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant
loading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education
during these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to
buy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I
did not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25. My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first
inventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of
salt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk. Later, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they
would use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me. They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy."

would use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me. They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy. In return, they would fill their baskets with goods they bought from me. Back then, personalized service meant a lot to my customers, as it still does today. Since there was no advertising, the quality of
service was the best way to keep my customers loyal. By word of mouth, people began to learn of my business here. In the beginning, I lived in the top of the store. In winter, it would get so cold, the soda bottles would freeze. In the summer, we would
open the doors to the stores for a breeze. However, outside was a dirt road, and the dust was so bad, it was almost better to leave the
doors shut. I didn't have many employees - one or two. Many days, I would run the cash register, load customers in the yard, and talk to
salespeople. Things would get kind of hectic. During the evenings, I would still haul livestock to St. Louis, rent a bed in a rooming
house to sleep for a few hours, and come back home. I worked many 24-hour days. A salesperson would call me every two weeks. I would order my supplies and would have to pay cash for what I needed right then. When people would ask for an item, I would try to get it in stock. By filling my customers' needs, I built my inventory up to a business
with a reputation that, ""we have everything you need.""
If you have noticed, our emblem is a wagon wheel. This represents how teamwork is necessary for progress. The hub, or the center of
the wheel, can be viewed as team members pulling together to get things done, just as the hub holds the spokes together so the wheel
can be put into motion. If one spoke is missing, the wheel cannot work. The same is true for our business. If someone does not
contribute as a team member, our business cannot work. With teamwork, it is difficult to run a business today; however, without
teamwork, it is IMPOSSIBLE and will surely fail. The 11 spokes in this wheel represent each of my children. Until the early 1960s, I never took a salary: all the profits went back into the business. I have 11 children. Putting food on the table
often meant using the outdated groceries from the store. When I think back, it seemed to be pretty hard work at times, and you didn't
have much time for yourself. But, I would not have done it if I didn't enjoy it. When my children were big enough to start helping out, they were a big help! With their new ideas, things just seemed to keep
growing. We began to buy a little grain and things in other areas. Our trucking operation expanded to meet our needs, and today, we
are still servicing our customers with a fleet. The feed division has come a long way from the floral print bags. We now manufacture
Premium Brand feeds for the surrounding communities and other custom feeds for a distribution network. In running this business, I have learned many things. One is that mistakes will be made. I feel that it is important to correct these
mistakes as they arise and to take care of our customers. Our family has worked by this motto, which has turned into our business motto:
 Rule #1: The customer is always right. Rule #2: When in doubt, refer to rule #1. No matter what your job is here at Buchheit, it is very important that you are honest, have a positive attitude, respect the company, and
respect the inventory, equipment, and the company's customers. These are the main contributions that make your paycheck possible. I am proud of the history of our company and of the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire Buchheit team. I want you to
take pride in your job and enjoy being part of this team. Rudy Buchheit

The ultimate goal of Buchheit is the profitable sale of merchandise and services to our customers. Not all of
you will be engaged in the sale of merchandise, but the following guidelines should be recognized as the
responsibilities of each team member in doing your part to maintain this goal. 1. Do everything possible to make working with Buchheit Logistics easy for our customer. 2. Recognize the need for a good attendance. You have a job to do and are needed to work your designated
 schedule. Your work is important for you and to Buchheit. When you miss your schedule, the customer
 misses a load, truck maintenance falls behind, customer paperwork suffers, depending on your
 department. A heavier burden is placed on others who work with you. 3. Whatever your assigned tasks, do them well and contribute to the overall teamwork of your fellow team
 members. The cooperation of each team member in his or her working relation with other team

Employment Categories
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Understanding the definitions of the employment classifications at Buchheit is important because your
classification is one of the factors that determines your employment status and benefit eligibility. These
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Since employment with
Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment
relationship at will at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. All team members are in an
introductory period during their first 90 days of employment with us. Depending on your position, you are designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state
wage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT team members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific
provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT team members are excluded from specific provisions of
federal and state wage and hour laws. Your EXEMPT and NONEXEMPT classification may be changed
only with written notification by Buchheit management. In addition to the Exempt and Nonexempt
categories, you also belong to one of the following employment categories:

FULL-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are regularly
scheduled to work the full-time schedule at Buchheit. Generally, regular full-time team members are eligible
for all Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Full-time team members need to work 1,560 hours in a calendar year to maintain their full-time status and
retain their benefits. REGULAR PART-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are
regularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule, but at least 1,040 hours in a year. Regular
part-time team members are eligible for some Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions,
and limitations of each benefit program. Part-time team members who work more than 1,560 hours in a
calendar year will be considered full-time and will be eligible for full-time benefits. PART-TIME team members are team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per
week. These team members may be employed in a temporary status. While part-time team members receive
all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are
ineligible for the other Buchheit benefit programs. TEMPORARY team members are team members who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily
supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in
this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond the initially stated period does not in any way
imply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain that status unless, and until, they are
notified of a change. While temporary team members receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social
Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are ineligible for all other Buchheit benefit programs. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR team members under contract or lease agreement with the company and
are not actual employees of the company. Independent contractors are ineligible for all Buchheit benefit
programs."

To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and team members may be asked to
provide body substance samples (such as urine, breath, and/or blood) to check for the illicit or illegal use of
drugs and alcohol. Drug testing is required as part of the post-offer, pre-employment process. Drug and alcohol testing
is required for ""safety-sensitive"" positions under DOT/FMCSA regulations, and for all team members
upon reasonable suspicion. A pending positive test result will result in a suspension until final results
are received. Test results for alcohol or drugs that are positive, or have been tampered with, will
result in immediate termination of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing will also result in

As a condition of employment, applicants (and current team members) agree to submit to alcohol and
controlled substance testing upon the request of employer with the following conditions to apply:

1. All DOT alcohol and controlled substance tests will be completed at a Buchheit Logistics approved
 collection site. 2. When the physician and/or Medical Review Officer (MRO) receives the results of the alcohol/controlled
 substance test, the results will be forwarded to Buchheit Logistics, who may review the results with any
 persons directly involved with the hiring process, officers of the corporation and the corporate attorney. 3. Applicants testing positive for controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol that are not prescribed by a
 physician will not be considered further for employment or will be dismissed immediately from
 employment. If applicable, the cost of the alcohol/controlled substance test will be deducted from any
 monies that may be owed to the individual. 4. Team members testing positive for any controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol will be
 immediately removed from safety-sensitive activities and disciplined up to and including termination of
 employment. In addition, all persons applying for employment with Buchheit Logistics will be required to
successfully complete a functional employment test (WorkSTEPS). The cost of this procedure will be paid
by Buchheit Logistics. Below is the process that will be followed:

1. Applicants should report to the Recruiting Department to complete the necessary application forms. 2. Authorized team member will interview applicants. 3. Authorized team member will offer employment to those candidates deemed to be the most qualified and
 suitable for the positions sought. The offers of employment will be contingent upon the successful
 completion of a post offer drug/alcohol screen, functional employment test, and DOT mandated
 background checks. 4. Upon receiving conditional offers of employment, applicants will be given written job descriptions and
 additional written information regarding the post-offer/pre-placement test. After carefully reviewing
 this information and/or consulting with their personal physicians, applicants must complete a
 release authorizing Buchheit and WorkSTEPS to conduct the post-offer functional employment
 tests. Requests for accommodations should be noted on the release. Depending on the nature
 of the accommodation sought, further discussions and/or medical documentation may be needed to
 identify an appropriate accommodation. Testing will be delayed until the interactive process aimed at
 identifying appropriate and necessary reasonable accommodations is completed. 5. Once the company receives a fully completed release and any requests for reasonable accommodations
 are resolved, the WorkSTEPS post-offer/pre-placement test will be scheduled. 6. Upon reporting to the licensed WorkSTEPS testing facility, applicants will be examined by a licensed
 occupational or physical therapist and their staff. 7. Applicants who successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be informed of start date
 and time to report for new hire orientation in Scott City, MO. 8. Applicants who fail to successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be notified. Because Buchheit Logistics seeks to make employment decisions based on the best available objective
 medical evidence, applicants who fail tests should provide any additional information they believe
 Buchheit Logistics should consider before withdrawing its conditional offer of employment. Additional Points: The cost of the post-offer WorkSTEPS test is paid by Buchheit Logistics. 17 | P a g e

Conflicts of Interest
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

As a team member of Buchheit, you have the obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit
actual or potential conflicts of interest. In this policy, Buchheit is establishing the framework within which
we operate. These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further
clarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the
Company President or the Chief Executive Officer. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision
that may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with
Buchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or
marriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood
or marriage. There is no ""presumption of guilt"" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if you have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative
that you disclose this fact to an officer of Buchheit as soon as possible. By alerting us to the existence of any
actual or even a potential conflict of interest, we can establish safeguards to protect all parties. The potential for personal gain is not limited to situations where a team member or relative has a significant
ownership in a firm with which Buchheit does business. Personal gains can also result from situations where
a team member or relative receives a kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of a
transaction or business dealings involving Buchheit. Company drivers are not allowed to have direct ownership in over-the-road equipment and are not
allowed to invest in a company which operates in motor carrier transportation, where the employee has
any direct or indirect involvement in the operations of such company. Outside Employment

of any outside job. If we determine that outside work is impacting your performance or the ability to meet
our requirements, which may change over time, you will be asked to terminate the outside job in order to
stay employed at Buchheit. We prohibit outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest. Further, you may not receive any

Wage Administration
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 04/05/2013

The wage administration program at Buchheit was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with
federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive
wages within our labor market. Because we believe that recruiting and retaining talented team members is
critical to our success, we are committed to paying our team members equitable wages that reflect the
requirements and responsibilities of their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly
situated team members at the same performance level in other organizations in the area. Compensation for every position is determined by several factors including the essential duties and
responsibilities of the job, the team member's performance, and wage survey data on pay practices of other
employers. We periodically review our wage administration program and restructure it as necessary. Timekeeping
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Nonexempt team members are responsible for accurately recording the hours they work. This information
also helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of ""time worked"" in order
to correctly calculate team members pay and benefits. ""Time worked"" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties. If you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as
well as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for
personal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours. Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special
circumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device. We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following
actions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with
time records, or recording another team member's time record. If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your
scheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled
ending time. The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from
your supervisor. If corrections or revisions are made to the time record, both the team member and supervisor must approve
the changes on the time record as being accurate. 25 | P a g e

Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Break periods will be allowed according to the schedule below. To the extent possible, break periods will be
in the middle of work periods. Meal periods are required according to the schedule below. Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. During meal periods, you
will be relieved of all work responsibilities and restrictions and will not be compensated for that time. - Team members scheduled 5 hours or less - One 15-minute break
- Team members scheduled between 5 1/2 and 6 1/2 hours - One 30-minute lunch
- Team members scheduled between 7 and 8 1/2 hours - One 15-minute break and one 30-minute lunch
- Team members scheduled 9 hours or more - One 15-minute break and one 60-minute lunch

Retail delivery drivers are required to take a 30-minute lunch each day, and OTR drivers are required a

assignments. Overtime is considered over 40-hours in the work week, however; drivers who transport
“interstate” freight may be excepted from overtime requirements. It is our policy that no overtime can be worked without the approval and authorization of the supervisor. We
try to distribute overtime among all team members who are qualified to perform the required work. All nonexempt team members will be paid overtime compensation in accordance with federal and state wage

productivity and service. In the rare instances when you cannot avoid being late or are unable to work as scheduled, be sure to notify
the location manager on duty, verbally, as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made. You as a team member of Buchheit are responsible to make the notification. Buchheit will in turn have the
team members’ schedules posted in the team member break room for the current week and the upcoming
week. Because unplanned absences can be disruptive to work, a poor attendance record or excessive lateness may
lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. As stated in the Attendance Point
system below, you as a team member, may have the following points deducted from your yearly (based on a
calendar year) total of 8-points for absences that are unapproved. The Attendance Point system is effective for all scheduled hourly team members in all retail store locations
and the Corporate Offices. Attendance Point System Chart:
- Each Absence = 1 point (Absence is defined as arriving to work two hours past your scheduled shift or
 your entire shift without a doctor’s note.)
- Each late in (tardy) or early out = ½ point (Late in is defined as 10 minutes past scheduled shift and early
 out is defined as leaving before the entire shift is completed and is unapproved by management.)
- Each Weekend Day Absence = 2-points per day (Each weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) absences is
 defined by missing your entire shift without a doctor’s note. And any absence of three scheduled days or
 more without a doctor’s note.)
- Each Holiday Absence = 2-points per day. Holidays are defined in policy Holidays, and also include
 business holidays such as Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving)."

Buchheit strives to maintain a positive work environment where team members treat each other with respect
and courtesy. Sometimes, issues can arise when team members may be unaware that their behavior at work
may be disruptive or annoying to others. Very often you can address these day-to-day issues by politely talking with your co-worker to bring the
perceived problem to his or her attention. In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate resolution. Buchheit encourages all team members
to keep an open mind and graciously accept constructive feedback or another team member's request for you
to change your behavior because it may be affecting that person's ability to concentrate and be productive. The following are some workplace etiquette guidelines and suggestions to help you be more conscientious
and considerate of your co-workers and the work environment. These are not necessarily intended to be hard
and fast work rules with disciplinary consequences. - Avoid public accusations or criticisms of other team members. - Address issues privately with those involved or your supervisor. - Try to minimize unscheduled interruptions of other team members while they are working. - Communicate by email or phone whenever possible, instead of walking unexpectedly into someone's
 office or workspace. - Be conscious of how your voice travels and try to lower the volume of your voice when talking on the
 phone or to others in open areas. - Keep socializing to a minimum and try to conduct conversations in areas where the noise will not be

Sexual or other unlawful of unwelcome harassment

Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace
Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice

Unauthorized absence from work area during the workday

Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment

Unauthorized disclosure of business ""secrets"" or confidential information

Violation of personnel policies

Unsatisfactory performance or conduct

Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to
terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause or advance notice, at any time. Problem Solving Process

We encourage team members to work out any problems they have with their peers and their immediate
supervisors on a one-to-one basis. If you believe your problem is not adequately addressed, you may take the
problem to any supervisor/manager in your line of authority. Tf you are unable to work out problems informally, you may briefly describe the problem in writing and
submit it to the corporate loss prevention department. Appropriate personnel will be assigned to look into
the problem and attempt to resolve it completely. Management will respond to the problem by the team
member’s next workday (Mon.-Fri.). If you are not satisfied with the resolution, you may discuss the
problem with senior corporate management. You must call the attention of management to the problem within 30 calendar days of its occurrence. If you
believe you are experiencing sexual harassment, you may raise this problem in the same manner as for any
other problem, except that you have 180 calendar days. When attempting to resolve a problem in person, two company representatives or members of management
must be present. Open Door Policy

Any applicant or employee who believes that there has been a violation of company policy or any applicable
law relating to accommodating a person with a disability should immediately contact the Human Resource
Department. All complaints are promptly investigated. All individuals are expected to cooperate with an
investigation. The information in the course of an investigation is held in confidence and is only disclosed to
individuals who have a need to know. Progressive Discipline

disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the team member for
satisfactory performance in the future. Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to
terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive
discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or
without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of
occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be
followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;
another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of
employment. Buchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify
either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual
progressive discipline steps. While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee
Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or
termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be
examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline. By using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early
stage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit. Problem Resolution

Resignation
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 03/18/2011

Resignation is defined as a voluntary act initiated by a team member to terminate employment with
Buchheit. Although there is no requirement that you give advance notice, doing so can reduce the impact on
your co-workers and productivity. We request a resigning team member submit a written notice of
resignation at least two weeks in advance. Vacation pay may be withheld without two-weeks’ notice, subject
to state law. Vacation time may not be included as part of the two-week notice. Before a team member leaves, we will schedule an off-site exit interview to better understand the reasons for
resignation and to go over any resulting benefit changes. Employment Termination
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of
the reasons for termination are routine. These are some of the most common circumstances for employment
terminations:

opportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of any outstanding
debt to Buchheit, or return of Buchheit-owned property. It is also a time for you to voice any suggestions,
complaints, and questions you may have. Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent,
either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause

Vacation Benefits
 Effective Date: 03/23/2009
 Revision Date: 03/18/2011

 Buchheit offers vacation time off with pay to eligible team members for rest, relaxation, and personal
 pursuits. Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:
 - Full-time team members
 - Regular part-time team members

 Full-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in
 the following schedule:
- After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year. - After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year. - After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year. Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be
 eligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the
 preceding two calendar years. The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a ""calendar year"". A "" calendar year"" is defined as
 the 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended
 for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the
 benefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information. Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the
 schedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued. You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should
 request the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will
 be reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements. Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations
 are granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may
 apply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence. Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any
 special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers
 vacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years’ earnings. We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the
 event that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused
 time. If your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through
 your last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements. 53 | P a g e

Unpaid Time Off Policy
Effective 12/08/2020

All team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment. When unpaid time
off is requested for personal reasons, a team member’s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid
time off can be requested. Unpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number
of consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than
three (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave
of absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence. Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as
the benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit
Retirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and
employer contributions to the plan. Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)
weeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to
properly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be
waived in emergency situations. Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and
communicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks
prior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing
and budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar
year. If request is considered excessive more than 10 days in a calendar year the request maybe denied. Requests may be approved or denied on the basis of these or other reasonable considerations.

Holidays
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 12/16/2020
We provide holiday time off with pay to eligible full-time team members who have completed 180 calendar
days of service as a full-time team member. If you are eligible for paid holidays, your holiday pay will be
calculated on your straight time pay rate. Holiday hours will be calculated as the following:
- Full time team members working 40 hours a week will receive 8 holiday hours
- Full time team members working 32 hours a week will receive 6.4 holiday hours
- Full time team members working 30 hours a week will receive 6 holiday hours

Also, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday
immediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday. If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or
vacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have
applied. If eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday
pay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. A holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team
members. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday. Paid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime. Payment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday. Recognized holidays are:
- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
- Independence Day (July 4)
- Labor Day (first Monday in September)
- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)
- Christmas (December 25)

Holidays
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 12/16/2020

We provide holiday time off with pay to eligible full-time team members who have completed 180 calendar
days of service as a full-time team member. If you are eligible for paid holidays, your holiday pay will be
calculated on your straight time pay rate. Holiday hours will be calculated as the following:

. Full time team members working 40 hours a week will receive 8 holiday hours
. Full time team members working 32 hours a week will receive 6.4 holiday hours
. Full time team members working 30 hours a week will receive 6 holiday hours

Also, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday
immediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday. If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or
vacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have

applied. If eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday
pay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. A holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team
members. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday. Paid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime. Payment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday. Recognized holidays are:

. New Year's Day (January 1)

. Memorial Day (last Monday in May)

. Independence Day (July 4)

. Labor Day (first Monday in September)

. Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)
. Christmas (December 25)

Workers' Compensation Insurance

Effective Date: 03/23/2009

Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Workers’ Compensation provides payment for medical expenses, wage loss, and disability to an
employee in the event of an injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires
medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. The injury must occur in the course and scope of employment. Subject to the applicable legal requirements, this program provides benefits after a short waiting period
or, in the event of hospitalization. The company is concerned about its employees. The Company and the Safety Department will work
with all employees injured on the job. Our priorities are to see that you receive proper medical attention
and return to work as soon as possible. 55|P age

It is critical that you inform your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless
of how minor it might appear at the time. Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for
workers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly. Failure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination. You must report any injury to the Workers’ Compensation Department within 8 hours. No action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees’ behalf until the Safety Department has been
notified. Drivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties
required of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and
performing pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal
vehicle to and from work. Workers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither
Buchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for
injuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activities that we may sponsor. The Safety Department must be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The
Company will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for
emergency situations). If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the
medical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the
United States. Each Workers’ Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed
compensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired. Your weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage."

I. Purpose: To outline the conditions under which an employee may request time off without pay for a
 limited period with job protection and no loss of accumulated service if the employee returns to work. II. Definition: A family or medical leave of absence is defined as an approved absence available to eligible
 employees for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year under particular circumstances that are critical to
 the life of a family. Leave may be taken:
 - on the birth of an employee’s child;
 - on the placement of a child for adoption or foster care with an employee;
 - when an employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;
 or
 - when an employee is unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of his or her position
 because of the employee’s own serious health condition. A “serious health condition” is one that requires inpatient or residential care or continuing treatment by a
health care provider. “Continuing treatment” includes two or more treatments by a health care provider
followed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider. It also
includes treatment of pregnancy or prenatal care, treatment of a chronic health condition of a serious nature,
treatment of a long-term or permanent health condition for which the family member must be under
continuing supervision of a health care provider, or any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a
health care provider either for restorative surgery or a condition, which if untreated, would result in an
incapacity of more than three days. For the purpose of this policy, a ""serious health condition"" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:
- Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
 hospice, or residential medical care facility; or
- A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or any other
 regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health
 care provider; or
- Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care; or
- A period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma,
 diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); or
- Any absences to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by, or on
 referral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three
 consecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.). For the purpose of this policy, health care providers who may provide certification of a serious health
condition include:
- Doctor of Medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State
 in which the doctor practices
- Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists and chiropractors (limited to treatment consisting

- Provide a written notice designating the leave as FMLA leave and detailing specific expectations and
 obligations of a team member who is exercising his/her FMLA entitlements. The team member may use
 the ""Employer Response to Employee Request for Family or Medical Leave"" to meet this requirement. This employer notice should be provided to the team member within one or two business days after
 receiving the team members notice of need for leave and include the following:
 o That the leave will be counted against the team member's annual FMLA leave entitlement
 o Any requirements for the team member to furnish medical certification and the consequences of
 failing to do so
 o The team member's right to elect to use accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave and whether the
 employer will require the use of paid leave, and the conditions related to using paid leave
 o Any requirement of the team member to make co-premium payments for maintaining group
 insurance and the arrangements for making such payments
 o Any requirements to present fitness-for-duty certification before being restored to his/her job
 o Rights to job restoration upon return from leave
 o Team member's potential liability for reimbursement of health insurance premiums paid by the
 employer during the leave if the team member fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave
 o Whether the team member qualifies as a ""key"" team member and the circumstances under which the
 team member may not be restored to his or her job following leave

Eligible team members seeking to use FMLA leave may be required to provide:
- 30-day advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable
- notice ""as soon as practical"" when the need to take FMLA is not foreseeable (at least verbal notice to the
 employer within 1-2 business days of learning of the need to take FMLA leave)
- sufficient information for the employer to understand that the team member needs leave for FMLAqualifying reasons (the team member need not mention FMLA when requesting leave to meet this
 requirement, but may only explain why the leave is needed)
- where the employer was not made aware that a team member was absent for FMLA reasons and the team
 member wants the leave counted as FMLA leave, timely notice (generally within two business days of
 returning to work) that leave was taking for FMLA-qualifying reason

In addition to the information required by the FLSA, a covered employer's records must show the following:
- dates FMLA leave is taken, or hours of leave taken if FMLA leave is in increments of less than a day
- copies of FMLA notices given to and by team members
- documents describing team member benefits and leave policies
- premium payments of team member benefits, and record of any dispute over FMLA leave

The records must comply with confidentiality requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The
company may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first
and second opinions differ, the company may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider,
approved jointly by the company and the employee and paid for by the company. Intermittent or reduced leave. Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule if it is
medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent. If
leave is requested on this basis, however, the company may require the employee to transfer temporarily to a
part-time schedule or an alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits. 63 | P a g e

Request form. The employee must fill out a “Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence” Form in
duplicate. This form must be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate
supervisor for proper approvals, and forwarded to the Human Resources Department (see attached copy of
‘Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence’ form). If possible, the form should be submitted 30
days before the effective date of the leave. All requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness must include sufficient medical
certification stating:
 (1) the date on which the serious health condition began;
 (2) the probable duration of the condition; and
 (3) the appropriate medical facts that the health care provider knows about the condition. In addition, for leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the
amount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care. For leave for an employee illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform at least
one of the functions of his or her position. For certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave
schedule for planned medical treatment, the certificate must state the dates on which such treatment is
expected to be given and the duration of the treatment. A team member who expects or anticipates taking a family or medical leave is required to notify the
Corporate Payroll Department of the date of commencement and the expected duration of the leave at least
30 days in advance of the leave, or, if the need for the leave is not foreseeable, as soon as practicable. In
cases where the need for leave is foreseeable, a team member's failure to provide 30 days’ notice prior to
taking leave may result in denial or delay of leave. A team member requesting leave under this policy should
submit a complete application for leave form to the Corporate Payroll Department. Certain ""key employees"" may not be eligible to be restored to the same or an equivalent position at the
conclusion of their leave. Buchheit will notify such team members of their ""key employee"" status and the
conditions under which job restoration may be denied, if applicable. ""Key employee"", as defined by law, is
typically a management position. An eligible team member may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period
without loss of seniority or benefits. The amount of leave available to a team member at any given time will
be calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the 12-month period immediately
preceding the requested leave. A team member who fails to return to work immediately following expiration
of the authorized leave period will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. All leave taken under this
policy and leave for any other reason which would qualify under FMLA (e.g. worker's compensation leave)
will be counted against the team members leave entitlement under FMLA. During a family or medical leave provided under this policy, team members shall first exhaust all unused
vacation before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. During a leave related to the team member's
serious health condition, the team member should also exhaust any available vacation or short-term
disability before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. Team members will not receive vacation pay in
addition to compensation from disability or worker's compensation insurance. 65 | P a g e

If a team member takes a leave of absence because of the serious health condition of the team member or the
team member's family member, the team member must submit to the Corporate Payroll Department written
medical certification from a health care provider of the serious health condition. Failure to provide such
certification upon request may result in a denial or delay of leave. Buchheit reserves the right to require that
the team member receive a second (and possibly a third) opinion from another health care provider (at
Buchheit's expense) certifying the serious health condition of the team member or the team member's family

recertification of the medical condition for which leave is taken. Before being able to return to work, a team member who is on leave of absence as a result of his or her own
serious health condition must submit a health care provider's written certification that the team member is
able to return to work. Failure to provide such certification may result in the delay or denial of job
restoration. During the team member's leave, Buchheit may also periodically inquire as to the team member's
intent to return to work. Leave taken because of the team member's or family member's serious health condition may be taken on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary. If a team member seeks leave on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis, the team member must submit medical certification, as discussed
above, and additional certification from the health care provider that the intermittent or reduced schedule
leave is medically necessary. Buchheit may require a team member taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave to transfer temporarily to
an alternative available position for which the team member is qualified or may modify the team member's
current position to better accommodate the team member's recurring periods of leave. During the team member's family or medical leave of absence, team members have the option to stop
coverage or stop premium payments during the FMLA leave. If the team member elects to continue

Return to Work Post-Employment Testing
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 01/01/2010

Post-employment examinations are successful tools utilized to create a more safe and secure working
environment for team members. With the advent of sports technology applied to the industrial worker,
comprehensive stress tests monitor heart and musculoskeletal function to detect disease processes, wear and
tear syndromes, and many other problems that lead to injuries and disability. Computerized testing and stress evaluations by licensed professionals in a medical setting typically cost over
$1,000, but Buchheit is willing to pay for such services to help their team members remain safe in the
workplace and to reduce costs associated with injuries. Training provided during the examination increases
body awareness during work activities to prevent cumulative trauma and to successfully reduce injuries. Furthermore, team member turnover and operating expenses are reduced by maintaining properly qualified
personnel in each position. Post-employment tests may be conducted:
- as part of team member's participation in a voluntary wellness program
- to determine a team member's fitness for duty
- in response to a team member's request for reasonable accommodation

Effective June 1st, 2004, all team members employed by Buchheit will be eligible to participate in voluntary
testing once every 12 months if the team member feels that he/she is physically unable to perform their
essential job functions. Team members are not required to participate in voluntary testing and team members
who elect not to participate will not be penalized for failing to participate. Fit-for-duty testing may be required on an as-needed basis should a team member demonstrate difficulty
performing any essential function of their position, or if there is some other reasonable basis, for belief that
an individual's ability to perform essential job functions is limited or impaired by a medical condition. Fit-for-duty testing will be required:
- any time a team member is transferred, either permanently or temporarily, to a position which has a
 physical demand level which is higher than the position that they are currently working
- any time a team member is absent from work for 3 or more days due to illness, medical procedure, or
 injury. Exclusion from fit-for-duty testing if the team member misses more than 3 scheduled days due to
 cold or flu symptoms provided you have a doctor’s note. - any time a team member has been put on restricted or limited duty due to illness, medical procedure, or
 injury, no matter how many days the team member was absent. - any time a team member has been to the emergency room due to illness or injury, no matter how many
 days the team member was absent

Team members must notify their location manager if they have been put on restrictive duty by their
physician. Team members who are put on restricted or limited duty due to a personal illness or injury (not
worker's compensation) may not be allowed to return to work until they have been released to full duty and
have passed the required fit-for-duty testing. Exceptions to this policy are handled on a case-by-case basis

We care about team members' health and well-being and recognize that personal problems can sometimes
disrupt personal and work lives. While many problems can be solved on your own or with the help of family
and friends, there may be times when you need professional assistance and advice. Through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Buchheit provides you and your immediate family
members with confidential access to professional counseling services for help in confronting such personal
problems as alcohol and other substance abuse, marital or family difficulties, financial or legal troubles, and
emotional distress. The EAP offers problem assessment, short-term counseling, and referrals to appropriate community and
private services. The EAP is strictly confidential and designed to safeguard the participant's privacy and rights. The
information you give an EAP counselor can be released only with your written consent, and EAP counselors
are guided by a Professional Code of Ethics. Personal information about EAP participation is maintained in a confidential manner. No information about
your participation in the program is made known to Buchheit. EAP counselors are required by law to notify
the company if the team member, co-workers, or customers are at risk. We offer EAP as a benefit to our team members, and there is no cost to consult with an EAP counselor. If
further counseling is necessary, the EAP counselor will outline available community and private services,
and the cost of these services will be the responsibility of the team member. If you have concerns that are negatively affecting your life, we strongly encourage you to use the Employee
Assistance Program. You can reach a confidential EAP counselor by dialing 1-800-356-0845 or www.paseap.com. Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

Employee Assistance Program

Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 03/18/2011

We care about team members' health and well-being and recognize that personal problems can sometimes
disrupt personal and work lives. While many problems can be solved on your own or with the help of family
and friends, there may be times when you need professional assistance and advice. Through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Buchheit provides you and your immediate family
members with confidential access to professional counseling services for help in confronting such personal
problems as alcohol and other substance abuse, marital or family difficulties, financial or legal troubles, and
emotional distress. The EAP offers problem assessment, short-term counseling, and referrals to appropriate community and
private services. The EAP is strictly confidential and designed to safeguard the participant's privacy and rights. The
information you give an EAP counselor can be released only with your written consent, and EAP counselors
are guided by a Professional Code of Ethics. Personal information about EAP participation is maintained in a confidential manner. No information about
your participation in the program is made known to Buchheit. EAP counselors are required by law to notify
the company if the team member, co-workers, or customers are at risk. We offer EAP as a benefit to our team members, and there is no cost to consult with an EAP counselor."
Logistics,General Business,handbook,Buchheit Logistics,,team|your|that|program|buchheit,2025-11-18T19:09:43.513655,971,"EAP counselors are required by law to notify
the company if the team member, co-workers, or customers are at risk. We offer EAP as a benefit to our team members, and there is no cost to consult with an EAP counselor. If
further counseling is necessary, the EAP counselor will outline available community and private services,
and the cost of these services will be the responsibility of the team member. Tf you have concerns that are negatively affecting your life, we strongly encourage you to use the Employee
Assistance Program. You can reach a confidential EAP counselor by dialing 1-800-356-0845 or www.paseap.com. Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) program that allows team members to have pre-tax
dollars deducted from their salaries to pay for eligible out-of-pocket expenses. The pre-tax contributions
made to the FSA can be used to pay for predictable non-reimbursed health care expenses during the plan
year. Through the FSA program, you can reduce your taxable income without reducing your real income, so that
you can keep more of the money you earn. 71|P age

## Page 73

Full-time team members who have completed 90 days of employment by July 1st are eligible to participate
in the Flexible Spending Account program. Participation in the Health Care FSA is optional and determined on an annual basis for the plan year. You
must enroll for each plan year, which begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th. You determine how much to
contribute to the account, up to a specified maximum, based on anticipated expenses during the plan year. Contributions are directed to the FSA through salary reduction on a pre-tax basis. This tax-free money is
then available to you for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Since the amounts that remain in the
account at the end of the plan year are forfeited, you should take care not to over-fund your account. Details of the Flexible Spending Account program are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). Contact the Payroll Department for more information on the FSA program and to obtain enrollment and
reimbursement forms and worksheets with examples of reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. Team Member Discounts

Special Orders
Special Order items are those items that have not been assigned a Buchheit SKU number. When a Team
Member purchases a Special-Order item the Team Member Retail on that item will be calculated as a
15% margin percentage over Delivered Landed Cost (Delivered Landed Cost is defined as the cost of the
item + Freight + Adders + any additional cost associated with the order) to the store. To calculate the
Team Member Special Order retail, take the total delivered landed cost divided by .85. (Delivered
Landed Cost / .85 = Team Member Retail). Everyday stocked items cannot be treated as special-order
items. Items transferred from Buchheit Agri-Center to the stores under a SKU number will be discounted at the
normal Retail Store Team Member Discount Schedule. Items that are transferred from the Buchheit
Agri-Center that do not have a SKU number will be priced as a special order. Non-Stocked SKUs
Items that are assigned a SKU number but not stocked in the store will be discounted the same as a
stocked item. Team Member Project Bid Pricing
We want to bid your building projects such as deck projects, kitchen cabinet projects, pole building
projects, house projects, fencing projects, etc. To qualify for Team Member Project Bid Pricing, the
total value of the material list must equal or exceed $1000 (before tax) at the normal Team Member
Price Discount. Projects must be submitted to the corporate estimator to be priced. Our corporate estimator will review the materials list and, in some cases, will discount items beyond the

BACKGROUND CHECKS
The Company may conduct a background check on any applicant or employee with their
signed consent. The background check may consist of prior employment verification,
reference checks, education confirmation, criminal background, credit history, or other
information, as permitted by law. Third-party services may be hired to perform these
checks. All offers of employment and continued employment are contingent upon a
satisfactory background check. Refusal to consent to a background check may result in
discipline, up to or including termination. AT-WILL NOTICE
The employment relationship between the Company and employees is at-will. This means
that employees are not hired for any specified period of time and their employment may
be terminated at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either
the Company or the employee. Company policy requires that all employees are at-will;
any implied, oral, or written agreements or promises to the contrary are void and
unenforceable, unless approved by an officer with the power to create an employment
contract. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other
Company document or written or verbal statement or policy. ANNIVERSARY DATE AND SENIORITY
The employee’s date of hire is their official employment anniversary date. Seniority is the
length of continuous service starting on that date. Should an employee leave the
Company and then be rehired, previously accrued seniority will be lost and seniority will
begin to accrue again on the date of rehire. With the exception of certain protected leaves
and paid time off, seniority does not accrue during leaves of absence that exceed 30
calendar days. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE
All employees are required to complete Section 1 of Form I-9 on their first day of
employment, and produce, within three business days, acceptable proof of their identity
and eligibility to work in the United States. Failure to produce the proper identifying
documents within three days will result in termination. INTRODUCTORY PERIOD
The employee's first 90 days of employment with the Company are considered an
introductory period. This introductory period will be a time for getting to know fellow
employees, managers and the tasks involved in the position, as well as becoming familiar
with the Company's products and services. The supervisor or manager will work closely
with each employee to help them understand the needs and processes of their job. This introductory period is a try-out time for the employee and the Company. During this
introductory period, the Company will evaluate employees' suitability for employment
and employees can evaluate the Company as well. At any time during this first 90 days,
employees may resign. If, during this period, employee work habits, attitude, attendance,

employee's job performance with them. During the course of the discussion, employees
are encouraged to give their comments and ideas as well. Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment for any
specified period of time, nor does it require that an employee be discharged only for
cause. Completion of the introductory period also does not imply that employees now
have a contract of employment with the Company, other than at-will. Successful
completion of the introductory period does not alter the at-will employment relationship. A former employee who has been rehired after a separation from the Company of more
than one year is considered an introductory employee during their first 90 days following

The Company has established the following employee classifications for compensation
and benefit purposes only. An employee's supervisor or manager will inform the
employee of their classification, status, and responsibilities at the time of hire, re-hire,
promotion or at any time a change in status occurs. These classifications do not alter the
employment at-will status. Regular Full-Time Employee
An employee who is regularly scheduled to work no less than 30 hours/week. The
employee may be exempt or non-exempt and is generally eligible for all employment
benefits offered by the Company. Regular Part-Time Employee
An employee who is regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours in a workweek and
may be eligible for some benefits. Temporary Employee

Non-Exempt
Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid
a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked. Unless notified
otherwise in writing by management, all employees of the Company are non-exempt. PERSONNEL RECORDS
The Company maintains various employment files while an individual remains an
employee of the Company. Such files may include employee personnel files, attendance
files, I-9 files, and files for medical purposes. Employees are required to notify their
manager should any of their personal information change (e.g., address, phone number,
last name) so the appropriate updates can be made to the files. The Company will take
reasonable precautions to protect employee files and employees' personally identifiable
information in its records. Employee files are restricted based on who reasonably needs access to all or parts of the
files. Employees may review their own personnel file by making a written request to their
manager or Human Resources. The written request will become a part of the employee's
personnel file. Review of files must take place in the presence of the employee's manager
or Human Resources. EMPLOYEE REFERENCES
All employee reference check requests should be forwarded to Human Resources; only
authorized members of management or Human Resources may provide this information. When the Company is contacted for a reference check or employment verification,
generally only positions held and dates of employment will be confirmed. In some

 during working hours in work areas. Such activity by employees during non-working
 time, including meal and rest periods, is not restricted so long as such activity does
 not interfere with the regular operation of business, is orderly, lawful, in good taste,
 conducted in an orderly manner, and does not create a safety hazard or a mess. Nonemployees are prohibited from all forms of solicitation on Company property at all
 times. SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT
The Company is committed to providing a work environment free of harassment in any
form, including inappropriate and disrespectful behavior, intimidation, and other
unwelcome conduct directed at an individual because of their inclusion in a protected
class. Applicable federal and state law defines harassment as unwelcome behavior based
on someone's inclusion in a protected class. Sometimes language or actions that were not
expected to be offensive or unwelcome actually are, so employees should err on the side
of being more sensitive to the feelings of their co-workers rather than less. The following are examples of harassment; behaviors not in this list may also be
considered harassment:

- Unwanted sexual advances;
- Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;
- Retaliation or threats of retaliation for refusing advances or requests for favors;
- Leering, making sexual gestures or jokes, or commenting on an employee's body;
- Displaying sexually suggestive content;
- Displaying or sharing derogatory posters, photographs, or drawings;
- Making derogatory epithets, or slurs;
- Ongoing teasing about an employee's religious or cultural practices;
- Ongoing teasing about an employee's sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity;
- Physical conduct such as touching, assault, or impeding or blocking movements

Sexual harassment on the job is unlawful whether it involves coworker harassment,
harassment by a manager, or harassment by persons doing business with or for the
Company, such as clients, customers or vendors. Retaliation
Any form of retaliation against someone who has expressed concern about any form of
harassment, refused to partake in harassing behavior, made a harassment complaint, or
cooperated in a harassment investigation, is strictly prohibited. A complaint made in good
faith will under no circumstances be grounds for disciplinary action. Individuals who make
complaints that they know to be false may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and

Enforcement
All managers and supervisors are responsible for:

- Implementing the Company's harassment policy;
- Ensuring that all employees they supervise have knowledge of and understand the
 Company policy;
- Reporting any complaints of misconduct to the designated company representative,
 the HR Manager, so they may be investigated and resolved internally;
- Taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when necessary
 to ensure compliance with the policy; and
- Conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the policy. Addressing Issues Informally
Employees who witness offensive behavior in the workplace - whether directed at them
or another employee - are encouraged, though not required, to immediately address it
with the employee whose behavior they found offensive. An employee who is informed
that their behavior is or was offensive should stop immediately and refrain from that
behavior in the future, regardless of whether they agree that the behavior could have
been offensive. Harassment Complaint Procedure
Employees are encouraged to use the Complaint Procedure to report behavior that they
feel is harassing, whether or not that behavior is directed at them. The Complaint
Procedure provides for immediate, thorough, and objective investigation of claims of
harassment. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against those who are
determined to have engaged in harassing behavior. ABUSIVE CONDUCT
Abusive conduct means malicious conduct in the workplace that a reasonable person
would find hostile or offensive and unrelated to an employer’s legitimate business
interests. Abusive conduct may include repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the
use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets, verbal or physical conduct that a
reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating, or the sabotage
or undermining of a person’s work performance. A single act will generally not constitute
abusive conduct, unless especially severe. The Company considers abusive conduct in the workplace unacceptable and will not
tolerate it under any circumstances. Employees should report abusive conduct to a
manager or Human Resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that employees are
not subjected to abusive conduct. All reports will be treated seriously and investigated
when appropriate. Employees who are found to have engaged in abusive conduct will be
subject to discipline, up to and potentially including termination. Retaliation against an
employee who reports abusive conduct or verifies that it took place is strictly prohibited. Enforcement

COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
The Company has established a procedure for a fair review of complaints related to any
workplace controversy, conflict, or harassment. Employees may take their complaint
directly to the person or department listed in Step 2 if the complaint is related to their
supervisor or manager or if the employee feels the supervisor or manager would not
provide an impartial resolution to the problem. Step 1
The complaint should be submitted orally or in writing to a supervisor or manager within
three working days of the incident or as soon as possible. Sooner is better, as it will assist
in a more accurate investigation, but complaints will be taken seriously regardless of
when they are reported. Generally, a meeting will be held within three business days of
the employee's request, depending upon scheduling availability. Attempts will be made
to resolve the issue during the meeting, but regardless of whether there is an immediate
resolution, the supervisor or manager will give the employee a written summary of the
meeting within three business days. Resolution may take longer if further investigation of
the complaint is required. If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution, they may
proceed to Step 2. Step 2
The employee may submit an oral or written request for review of the complaint and Step
1 resolution to the HR Manager or a designated investigator. This request should be made
within three working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The HR Manager
or the designated investigator will review the complaint and resolution and may call an
additional meeting to explore the problem. If warranted, additional fact-finding will be
undertaken. A final decision will be rendered within 10 working days after receiving the
Step 2 request, and a written summary of the resolution will be provided to the employee
who filed the complaint. CORRECTIVE ACTION
A high level of job performance and professionalism is expected from each employee. In
the event that an employee’s job performance does not meet the standards established
for the position, they violate company policies or procedures, or their behavior is
otherwise unacceptable, corrective action may ensue. Corrective action may include, but
is not limited to: coaching, oral or written warnings, performance improvement plans,
paid or unpaid suspension, demotion, and termination. The type and order of actions
taken will be at management's sole discretion and the Company is not required to take
any disciplinary action before making an adverse employment decision, including
termination. CompPLAINT PROCEDURE

PAY PERIODS
The standard seven-day payroll workweek for the Company will begin at 12:00 a.m. Sunday. The designated pay period for all employees is weekly. Paydays are every Friday. Except as otherwise provided, if any date of paycheck distribution falls on a holiday,
employees will be paid on the preceding scheduled workday. TIMEKEEPING (NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES)
All non-exempt employees are required to use the timekeeping system to record their
hours worked. For the purpose of this policy, all forms of timekeeping will be referred to
as clocking in or out. Employees should clock in no sooner than five minutes before their scheduled shift and
clock out no later than five minutes after their scheduled shift. Additionally, employees
are required to clock in and out for their designated lunch periods. The length of the lunch
period will be designated by the employee’s manager; alteration or waiver of the lunch
period requires manager approval. Lunch periods are unpaid time when employees are
relieved of all duties. Waiver of the lunch period requires prior approval of the employee’s
manager. Under no circumstance may the waiver of the lunch period result in overtime
work. Accurate timekeeping is a federal and state wage and hour requirement, and employees
are required to comply. Failing to enter time into the timekeeping system in an accurate
and timely manner is unacceptable job performance. Employees may not ask another
employee to clock in or out for them. Should an employee miss an entry into the
timekeeping system, they must notify their manager as soon as possible for correction. Non-exempt employees are not permitted to work unscheduled time without prior
authorization from their manager. This includes clocking in early, clocking out late, or
working through scheduled break or lunch periods. REPORTING TIME PAY (NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES)
Non-exempt employees who are required to report to work and are subsequently sent
home by the Company without completing their assigned shift due to a lack of work will
be paid any applicable reporting time pay. Employees will be paid for no less than one hour. All time worked prior to dismissal counts
toward these totals. Reporting time pay will be compensated at the employee’s regular

OVERTIME (NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES)
The Company complies with all applicable federal and state laws with regard to payment
of overtime work. Non-exempt employees are paid overtime at the rate of one and onehalf times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Employees are required to work overtime when assigned. Any overtime worked must be
authorized by a supervisor or manager, in advance. Working unauthorized overtime or
the refusal or unavailability to work overtime is not acceptable work performance, and is
subject to discipline, including but not limited to termination. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS (EXEMPT EMPLOYEES)
The Company complies with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) and does not make improper deductions from the salaries of exempt employees. There are, however, certain circumstances where deductions from the salaries of exempt
employees are permissible. Such circumstances include:

- When an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days for
 personal reasons other than sickness or disability
- When an exempt employee is absent for one or more full days due to sickness or
 disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide sick leave plan that

Insurance benefits, not a leave entitlement. The Family Leave Insurance benefits program
does not establish the right of a covered individual to be restored to employment
following a period of leave from work to participate in providing care for a family member

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS
If the Company is made aware of an employee's disability and resulting need for
accommodation, Human Resources or the employee's manager will engage with them in
the interactive process. This process will determine what, if any, accommodations are
necessary and reasonable in order to assist the employee in doing the essential functions
of their job. Whether an accommodation is reasonable will be determined based on a
number of factors, including whether it will effectively assist the employee in doing the
essential functions of their job, the cost, and the effect on business operations. In most
cases, employees will be required to provide documentation from an appropriate
healthcare provider. Human Resources will provide employees with the necessary form. All employees are required to comply with safety standards. Employees who pose a direct
threat to the health or safety of themselves or others in the workplace may be temporarily
moved into another position or placed on leave until it is determined if a reasonable
accommodation will effectively mitigate the risk. INJURY AND ACCIDENT RESPONSE AND REPORTING

that manager. When any accident, injury, or illness occurs while an employee is at work,
regardless of the nature or severity, the employee must complete an injury reporting form
and return it to Human Resources as soon as possible. Reporting should not be allowed
to delay necessary medical attention. Once the accident is reported, follow-up will be
handled by Human Resources or the designated Safety Officer, including a determination
as to whether the injured employee may return to work. Questions asked by law enforcement or fire officials making an investigative report should
be answered giving only factual information and avoiding speculation. Liability for
personal injury or property damage should never be admitted in answering an
investigatory question asked by law enforcement or fire officials. In addition to compliance with safety measures imposed by federal Occupational Safety
and Health Act (OSHA) and state law, the Company has an independent interest in making
its facilities a safe and healthy place to work. The Company recognizes that employees
may be in a position to notice dangerous conditions and practices and therefore
encourages employees to report such conditions, as well as non-functioning or hazardous
equipment, to a manager immediately. Appropriate remedial measures will be taken
when possible and appropriate. Employees will not be retaliated or discriminated against
for reporting of accidents, injuries, or illnesses, filing of safety-related complaints, or
requesting to see injury and illness logs. WORKERS' COMPENSATION

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS

If the Company is made aware of an employee's disability and resulting need for
accommodation, Human Resources or the employee's manager will engage with them in
the interactive process. This process will determine what, if any, accommodations are
necessary and reasonable in order to assist the employee in doing the essential functions
of their job. Whether an accommodation is reasonable will be determined based on a
number of factors, including whether it will effectively assist the employee in doing the
essential functions of their job, the cost, and the effect on business operations. In most
cases, employees will be required to provide documentation from an appropriate
healthcare provider. Human Resources will provide employees with the necessary form. All employees are required to comply with safety standards. Employees who pose a direct
threat to the health or safety of themselves or others in the workplace may be temporarily
moved into another position or placed on leave until it is determined if a reasonable
accommodation will effectively mitigate the risk. INJURY AND ACCIDENT RESPONSE AND REPORTING

 continuing a business relationship with a client or vendor
- An employee selecting a relative's company as a supplier when they have not
 produced the best proposal
- An employee taking a second job working for a competitor and sharing confidential
 company information with the competitor

Because how things appear, whether accurate or not, has a significant impact on the
Company's reputation, employees should also avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest. If questions arise as to whether a certain activity or behavior is a conflict of
interest, employees should speak with their manager or HR. BUSINESS GIFTS
Employees are prohibited from directly or indirectly requesting or accepting a gift for
themselves or the company that has a value of $50 or more. If an employee is offered or
given anything of value from any client, prospective client, vendor, or business partner in
connection with company business, they should alert their manager immediately. OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
Employees may engage in outside employment during non-working hours, provided
doing so does not interfere with their job performance or constitute a conflict of interest. Prior to accepting outside employment, employees should notify their manager in writing. The notice must include the name of the Company, the title and nature of the position,
the number of working hours per week, and the time of scheduled work hours. If the
position constitutes a conflict of interest or interferes with the employee’s job at any
time, they may be required to limit or end their outside employment. This policy does not prevent employees from using their approved breaks and rest periods
to solicit outside of working areas and is not intended to infringe an employee's Section
7 rights. Those not employed by the company are prohibited from solicitation on
company property at all times. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

A conflict of interest arises when an employee is engaged in activity that could be
detrimental to the company. This includes when an employee improperly uses their
position with the company for personal gain or the gain of someone with whom they have
a relationship. /mproper use includes behavior that is illegal, as well as behavior that is
unethical or questionable to a reasonable person. These are some examples of a conflict
of interest:

e An employee requesting or requiring gifts or discounts in exchange for starting or
continuing a business relationship with a client or vendor

e An employee selecting a relative's company as a supplier when they have not
produced the best proposal

e An employee taking a second job working for a competitor and sharing confidential
company information with the competitor

e An employee taking a second job that interferes with their ability to do their work
for the Company at their full potential, whether due to scheduling, exhaustion, or
some other factor

Because how things appear, whether accurate or not, has a significant impact on the
Company's reputation, employees should also avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest. If questions arise as to whether a certain activity or behavior is a conflict of
interest, employees should speak with their manager or HR. BusINess GIFTS

to infringe on an employee’s Section 7 rights and any adverse action taken in accordance
with this policy will evaluate whether employees were engaged in protected concerted
activity. Avoiding Harassment

status protected by state or federal law. Avoiding Defamation
Employees must not post anything they know or suspect to be false about the Company
or anyone associated with it, including fellow employees and clients. Writing something

RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION
The company will consider all requests for religious accommodations. Such requests may include time off
for attendance at religious services, an absence for observance of a religious holiday, or an employee’s
attire. Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s religious beliefs, unless such an
accommodation results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION
The company will consider all requests for disability accommodations to individuals who are otherwise
qualified to perform the essential functions of a job. When an employee has a need for an accommodation,
the employee must let the Human Resources Manager know that an adjustment or a change at work is
needed for a reason related to a medical condition. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first
step in an informal, interactive process between the employee and the company. The company will make
an attempt to accommodate the employee’s need for workplace changes with the company’s need to
maintain an efficient, productive workplace. Before addressing the merits of the accommodation request, the company will determine if the employee’s
medical condition meets the definition of a disability, a prerequisite for the employee to be entitled to a
reasonable accommodation. The term disability means, with respect to an individual:

 - A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the
 individual
 - A record of such an impairment; or
 - Being regarded as having such an impairment

Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,
concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of a
major bodily function, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth,
digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive
functions. The company may require documentation showing that the employee has a covered disability and stating
any functional limitations. The documentation must be sufficient to substantiate that the employee has a
covered disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested. Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s disability, unless such an accommodation
results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. An undue hardship
will be based upon an individualized assessment of current circumstances. RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION

TRAINING

THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS
At each of our restaurants, you will hear repeatedly: Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance,
Product Quality and Speed with Service. These are the principles that our brands were built on and are the
standards for our daily operation. If we can provide our guests with great service, we can keep their loyalty
and they will come back. We want to provide our guests with an atmosphere that is fun, casual, and comfortable. Each of our
restaurants has been designed with the guest in mind, in order to make our guests’ stay a truly enjoyable
one. Great service begins and ends with you----we want to have Customer Maniacs working for B&G. Cleanliness: To ensure that our guests have a dining experience that is both pleasant and healthy, we
constantly clean and maintain the entire restaurant - the exterior, the dining area, the counter area, the
restrooms, and the kitchen. We really never have a “spare” moment, because whenever business slows
down, we are cleaning. Hospitality: We treat our customers as if they were guests in our own home. We will go that extra step to
make guests feel welcome. We strive to provide good service because it makes our job more pleasant and
also improves our business. Taco Bell along with the other YUM Brands spend millions of dollars each
year on advertising, but the attentiveness, courtesy, and friendliness you display toward our guests is our
most important form of marketing. Product Quality and Accuracy: Our menu items are the product of a great deal of research and
development, but we rely on you to make sure that every one of our guests enjoys a hot, tasty, and perfectly
prepared meal every time they visit one of our restaurants. We are famous for the quality of our food, so
we will insist that you follow specific food preparation procedures that are both efficient and sanitary. Speed with Service: One thing always to keep in mind is that efficient guest service is our number one
priority. Everything we do is for our guest because our guests are our business. Guests come to Taco Bell

THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS

At each of our restaurants, you will hear repeatedly: Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance,
Product Quality and Speed with Service. These are the principles that our brands were built on and are the
standards for our daily operation. If we can provide our guests with great service, we can keep their loyalty
and they will come back. We want to provide our guests with an atmosphere that is fun, casual, and comfortable. Each of our
restaurants has been designed with the guest in mind, in order to make our guests’ stay a truly enjoyable
one. Great service begins and ends with you----we want to have Customer Maniacs working for B&G. Cleanliness: To ensure that our guests have a dining experience that is both pleasant and healthy, we
constantly clean and maintain the entire restaurant - the exterior, the dining area, the counter area, the
restrooms, and the kitchen. We really never have a “spare” moment, because whenever business slows
down, we are cleaning. Hospitality: We treat our customers as if they were guests in our own home. We will go that extra step to
make guests feel welcome. We strive to provide good service because it makes our job more pleasant and
also improves our business. Taco Bell along with the other YUM Brands spend millions of dollars each
year on advertising, but the attentiveness, courtesy, and friendliness you display toward our guests is our
most important form of marketing. Product Quality and Accuracy: Our menu items are the product of a great deal of research and
development, but we rely on you to make sure that every one of our guests enjoys a hot, tasty, and perfectly
prepared meal every time they visit one of our restaurants. We are famous for the quality of our food, so
we will insist that you follow specific food preparation procedures that are both efficient and sanitary. Speed with Service: One thing always to keep in mind is that efficient guest service is our number one
priority. Everything we do is for our guest because our guests are our business. Guests come to Taco Bell
expecting fast and friendly service, so we expect you to be efficient, attentive, courteous, and respectful at
all times. ---

TEAMWORK

Teamwork plays a big role within each individual restaurant operation. Also, the spirit of teamwork makes
the job a great deal more enjoyable, which in turn is passed along to our guests. Think of teamwork as you would playing a game. One great star does not necessarily do everything it takes
to help the team win. It is only when all of the players pull together and enjoys the team’s performance
again and again. We accomplish a great team performance through proper training. THE TRAINING PROGRAM
The Company training program is implemented in the stores to ensure that employees build the skills
needed to serve our customers. - Doing more for and giving more to customers than the competition. - Learning the processes and procedures required to meet/exceed expectations and standards. - Improving performance to ensure the Restaurant’s continuous growth and success. - Developing employees’ self-sufficiency in running the Restaurant. Training Systems: Web-based training systems are designed for trainees who are new to their jobs. The
training systems help trainees develop the skills and knowledge they need to meet and maintain our high
restaurant operating standards. Trainees must be certified in each position that they train for. Your manager
will explain all aspects of the Company’s training programs. Individuals are constantly encouraged to improve their performance, expand the scope of their
responsibilities, and provide training to other employees who need it. That is the only way that restaurant
employees can become self-sufficient and successful. Your managers will explain all aspects of the Company’s training program. TEAMWORK

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Eligibility - If you work at a company location with 50 employees within 75 miles and have at least 12
months of service and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the preceding 12 months, you may be eligible
for up to 12 weeks of medical leave of absence for certain family care and medical reasons, during any
rolling 12-month period. Generally, employment periods prior to a break in service of seven years or more
will not be counted in determining whether the employee has completed at least 12 months of service. The
12-month period will be measured backward from the date you use leave and include both paid and unpaid
leaves. Each time you use leave, the remaining leave available will be the balance of the 12 weeks that has
not been used during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Description of Qualified Leaves - You may be entitled for up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave
for the following reasons:

o the birth of a son or daughter and to care for the newborn
o placement of a son or daughter for adoption or a foster child with you. (Leave for such purposes must be taken in one consecutive period and must be completed within
 12 months following the birth or placement. However, this leave does not have to be taken
 immediately following the birth or placement of the child.)
o To care for your spouse, son, daughter, or parent (not in-laws) with a serious health condition. Employees who are not eligible for family and medical leave will not be allowed an unpaid personal
 leave of absence for the illness of a parent. o For your own serious health condition that prevents you from performing your job duties and
 responsibilities. o For a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that your spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered
 military member defined as:
 - National Guard or Reserves or retired member of the Regular Armed Forces or Reserves on
 federal active duty in a foreign country or is called to federal active duty in a foreign country,
 provided that such duty is in support of a contingent operation; or
 - Regular Armed Forces deployed to a foreign country or international waters regardless of the
 nature of the service performed in that foreign country or international waters and regardless
 of whether it is in support of a contingent operation. Absences due to a work-related injury or illness, whether paid or unpaid, which qualify as a serious health
condition will be considered absences under this policy, and time off will be deducted from the maximum
annual 12-week leave entitlement period. You may be entitled for up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period if you are the spouse, son,
daughter, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember and must care for that

for up to 12 weeks of medical leave of absence for certain family care and medical reasons, during any
rolling 12-month period. Generally, employment periods prior to a break in service of seven years or more
will not be counted in determining whether the employee has completed at least 12 months of service. The
12-month period will be measured backward from the date you use leave and include both paid and unpaid
leaves. Each time you use leave, the remaining leave available will be the balance of the 12 weeks that has
not been used during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Description of Qualified Leaves - You may be entitled for up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave
for the following reasons:

othe birth of a son or daughter and to care for the newborn

o. placement of a son or daughter for adoption or a foster child with you. (Leave for such purposes must be taken in one consecutive period and must be completed within
12 months following the birth or placement. However, this leave does not have to be taken
immediately following the birth or placement of the child.)

o To care for your spouse, son, daughter, or parent (not in-laws) with a serious health condition. Employees who are not eligible for family and medical leave will not be allowed an unpaid personal
leave of absence for the illness of a parent. o For your own serious health condition that prevents you from performing your job duties and
responsibilities. o Fora qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that your spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered
military member defined as:

= National Guard or Reserves or retired member of the Regular Armed Forces or Reserves on
federal active duty in a foreign country or is called to federal active duty in a foreign country,
provided that such duty is in support of a contingent operation; or

= Regular Armed Forces deployed to a foreign country or international waters regardless of the
nature of the service performed in that foreign country or international waters and regardless
of whether it is in support of a contingent operation. Absences due to a work-related injury or illness, whether paid or unpaid, which qualify as a serious health
condition will be considered absences under this policy, and time off will be deducted from the maximum
annual 12-week leave entitlement period. You may be entitled for up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period if you are the spouse, son,
daughter, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember and must care for that
servicemember. A covered servicemember who has a serious illness or injury incurred in the line of duty
on active duty for which he or she is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in outpatient
status, or is on the temporary disability retired list. Coverage also includes a servicemember’s serious
illness or injury that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty which was aggravated
by service in the line of duty on active duty. A covered servicemember includes a member of the Armed
Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves or a member of the Armed Forces, the National Guard or
Reserves who is on the temporary disability retired list. Covered servicemember also includes a veteran
discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable, who is undergoing medical treatment,

An eligible employee will be entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks of all type of FMLA leave. The
“single 12-month period” referenced above begins on the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave
to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12 months after that date, regardless of the method used to
determine the 12 workweeks for other FMLA qualifying reasons. If Both Spouses Work for the Company - If both spouses are employed by the company, a combined
total of 12 weeks is available for the birth of a son or daughter or to care for the child after birth, placement
of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, or to care for the employee’s parent with a serious
health condition. Spouses employed by the company are limited to a combined total of 26 weeks for leave
during the relevant 12-month period if the leave taken is to care of a covered servicemember and for the
birth or placement of a health child or care for parent with a serious health condition. The military caregiver
leave does not alter the 12-week limitation that applies to leave taken by spouses employed by the same
employer for leave for the birth or placement of a healthy child or to care for a parent with a serious health
condition, even if the spouses combined took fewer than 14 weeks of leave to care for a covered
servicemember. Compensation - All available sick leave must be taken at the commencement of the leave period, prior to
beginning unpaid leave status, if the leave is due to a serious health condition. All available vacation must
be taken at the commencement of a leave of absence, after the use of available sick leave and prior to
beginning unpaid leave status. The maximum amount of leave time available will be 12 weeks, (or 26
weeks for Military Caregiver Leave) including both paid and unpaid leave. An employee who incurs a
work-related illness or injury cannot substitute paid vacation or sick leave for workers’ compensation
payments. Requesting Leave - In the event of foreseeable leaves, you must provide 30 days’ notice, or as much notice
as is practicable, by completing a “Request for Medical Leave of Absence Form” at the Restaurant Support
Center. If 30 days’ notice is not possible, you must provide notification no later than the next business day
after learning of the need for the leave. Medical Certification - When leave is taken due to a serious health condition of either you or a covered
family member, you must provide the certification form completed by a health care provider within 15 days
of the request. If the certification is incomplete or insufficient, the Human Resources Representative will
notify you and allow you up to 7 days to cure the certification deficiency. The Human Resources
Representative may seek clarification from your health care provider regarding the information contained
on the certification form with your written authorization provided to the company and to your health care
provider. The Company reserves the right to request a second and/or third opinion, at the Company’s
expense, from a health care provider chosen by the Company. Additionally, a recertification verifying the
need for leave may be requested by the Company to support a continuing medical leave every 30 days or
at the expiration of the minimum duration of the condition, whichever is later. Such recertification can be
requested at any reasonable interval but not less than every 30 days unless:

 ◼ You request an extension of leave;
 ◼ Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly; or
 ◼ Company management receives information that casts doubt on the continuing validity of the most
 recent certification. In the event that appropriate certification or recertification is not provided, the leave of absence will not be
granted or continued, and you will be subject to the company’s policies regarding unexcused absences.

must notify the Restaurant Support Center at least two days prior to your expected date of return, or if you
will not be able to return when expected. Failure to do so may result in denial or delay of the leave or

OUR WORK HOURS
You are responsible for knowing the work hours of the restaurant where you work. The workday begins
two hours before the restaurant opens and ends approximately one hour after closing. Crew members are
to work the hours determined and scheduled by the General Manager. YOUR WORK SCHEDULE
Work schedules for crew members are made up each week to fit the restaurant’s operating needs. Schedules
are posted a minimum of one week in advance for the following week. You must give the General Manager
advance written notice of any pending changes in your availability or inability to work specific times prior

jobs. To minimize confusion, each station has been divided into substations where you can concentrate on
smaller groups of job tasks at one time. You will be assigned a work position based on the immediate needs of your restaurant. Any additional
training will be determined by the business needs of the restaurant and by your performance. We have found that the closest teamwork is achieved when everyone understands each person’s job. For
that reason, you may eventually be trained at several stations. Your General Manager will follow your
progress at each station. Together you will decide when you are ready to move to the next training step. CASH REGISTER POLICY

LOUISIANA STATE MINOR VIOLATION POLICY
 Any minor who violates the state’s minor break policy will receive a written warning for his/her first
 violation. If a minor commits a second state policy violation, he/she will be suspended for one week with
 no pay. If a minor commits a third state policy violation, he/she will be terminated immediately. Louisiana State Minor Violation Policy regarding GM’s, AGM’s, and Shift Leaders: If a state minor
 violation is committed the MIC will receive a written warning and a one-day suspension without pay. If a
 MIC received his/her second minor violation within 30 days of the first they will receive 1 week suspension
 with no pay. GM’s who are not present at the time a minor violation occurs will receive the following disciplinary action:
 (1) A written warning for the first state violation. (2) If a second state policy is broken within 30 days of
 the first the GM will be suspended one-day without pay. (3) If a third minor violation is committed within
 60 days of the first violation the GM will be suspended one-week without pay. It is the Area Coach’s’ responsibility to ensure that there are no minor violations in their market. If minor
 policies are not followed in a market, and if adequate procedures are not implemented and followed, the
 Area Coach will be held responsible. After a written warning, the Area Coach risks being removed for
 repeated violation. Minors represent a vital part of our operations. Without them it would be next to impossible to run our
 stores, but if we cannot manage this very important “Human Resource” we will be forced to abandon using
 workers under the age of 18 because the financial constraints (fines up to $500 per infraction) will leave us
 no alternative. TAKING A BREAK
You are expected to take your breaks in the restaurant lobby only. The Manager-in-Charge will specify the
time for breaks. If you are paid on an hourly basis, you are to record your time out for breaks and your time back in upon
return to work. In cases where business volume suddenly increases and the Manager-in-Charge needs help from you while
on break, you are expected to help with the temporary workload. When the increase in volume has been
handled, the Manager-in-Charge will allow you to resume the break. If a meal is interrupted, it will be
replaced at no charge. (This policy does not include Louisiana Minors who must take an uninterrupted
break.)

In cases where business volume suddenly decreases, the Manager-in-Charge may ask you to clock out and

SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEE PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION

It is the Company’s intent to safeguard employee personal and private information. Examples of personal
information include social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, emergency
contact information, medical information or any other personal or private information to which the public
does not have general access, or which may directly identify an individual. In the course of performing
their job duties, some employees may have access to gain the personal and private information of other
employees (i.e., setting up payroll, medical benefits, etc.). These employees are expected to only use such
information in the course of performing their job. It is expected that all employees maintain confidentiality
of the personal or private information of other employees. Employee personal or private information may
only be released for business-related reasons on a need-to-know basis with approval from the Human
Resources Representative, or as required by applicable law. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
You should recognize your responsibility to avoid any conflict between your personal interest and those of
the Company’s business interests. A conflict of interest exists when you, knowingly or unknowingly,
engage in any activity that may compromise you, another employee, or the company in its relationship with
a customer, vendor, or competitor. Also, a conflict of interest occurs when the Company’s interests
interfere, or appear to interfere, with your ability to make sound business decisions on behalf of the
Company. Nothing in this policy is to be interpreted as applying to concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection under the National Labor Relations Act. You are prohibited from engaging in any activity, practice, or act which conflicts with, or appears to conflict
with, the interests of the Company, its customers, or vendors. Full disclosure should be made to the
Manager-in-Charge of any potential conflict of interest, before it occurs, is required. You should not have additional employment in a competitive restaurant or other business which could
interfere with your ability to work or to provide your best performance for the Company, and such
employment must never result in a conflict of interest. You should inform you Manager-in-Charge if you
decide to obtain employment in addition to your job with the Company. Additionally, personal relationships which may result in a conflict of interest are discouraged and, as such,
employees must comply with the following policies:

 - Employees are not permitted to fraternize socially with fellow employees, if such personal
 relationships would result in conflicts of any type. - It is not permitted for a Manager to fraternize out-side of the workplace with an employee under
 his or her authority. - It is not permitted for any Manager to give a ride to an employee under his or her authority. EMPLOYEE DATING
Dating between employees is discouraged by company management. If such relationships occur and create
any type of disruption in the workplace, the company reserves the right to transfer or terminate one or both
employees involved. Managers and supervisory personnel are prohibited from dating or engaging in intimate personal
relationships with employees reporting to them either directly or indirectly. SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEE PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION

SECURITY
The security of the Company is every employee’s responsibility. The Company takes a very positive
approach when security matters arise. You should discuss with the Manager-in-Charge and/or the Director
of Operations any problem which may arise with regard to security. The back door of every restaurant should always have its alarm on and be locked. The back door should
never be opened after dark. Under no circumstances is anyone not working allowed in the restaurant
before or after business hours. This includes off-duty crew, family, and friends. Violation of this
important safety procedure will needlessly endanger the lives of your co-workers and may result in
your immediate termination. Security policies and devices should not be discussed with anyone outside the Company. You are
responsible for understanding and following the Company’s established security procedures. A violation
of the safety policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Once the lobby is closed at night, never open the door for anyone, including the owner or any of B &
G’s Staff, unless they have made prior arrangements. Most robberies occur when employees allow someone
in after the lobby is locked. SAFETY IS IMPORTANT
It is the Company’s policy to provide a safe and healthful workplace. Company safety procedures must be
followed at all times to ensure that crew members and guests enjoy safe restaurant conditions. It is your
responsibility to read and understand the safety policies located in each restaurant. The policies cover
information on restaurant equipment, knives, electrical, material handling, storage, employee
health/sanitation, building exterior, severe wind, fires, robbery, and vehicles and driving. The safety policies apply to all employees. You are required to observe all safety rules and procedures,
properly use the safety equipment provided as required, practice safety at all times, not create any safety
hazards, and report all safety hazards to the Manager-in-Charge immediately. You are to observe the safety rules contained in the safety program in every phase of your work. You are
required to participate in the safety effort of the Company by working safely and attending and participating
in safety sessions when offered. Safety sessions are held every quarter. Incidents involving personnel are
reviewed on a regular basis to identify any possible safety hazards. If you should have an incident or injury,
report it to your Manager-in-Charge immediately no matter how insignificant it may seem. If you seek
medical attention for a work-related injury, a drug screen is required during the first visit. B&G has
recommended medical facilities and are posted in each location. If you use another facility the General
Manager MUST be notified immediately. Your particular job requirement may include additional specific

ATTENDANCE, PUNCTUALITY AND TIME RECORDS
 All employees are expected to be at work at the time scheduled for their attendance and be at their work stations at
the scheduled time for work to begin. When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to
telephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may
be absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin
when they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee’s time
sheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance
approval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to
discipline. Upon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the
reason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor’s certificate, to substantiate the
absence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or
written reprimand, or termination of employment. Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early
departures as well as absence for an entire day. An employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to
have voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY. Employees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records. Employees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log
out for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business
purposes as part of their job duties. Tampering with another employee’s time records, including logging another
employee in or out, is prohibited and may result in immediate termination."

practice,” that is by no means sufficient reason to assume that such practice is acceptable at E.N.D JEWELRY. There is no way to develop a comprehensive, detailed set of rules to cover every business situation, therefore this
policy is intended to outline some basic guidelines to be followed. Whenever employees are in doubt, they should
consult with their manager. Conflicts of interests or unethical behavior may take many forms including, but not limited to, the
acceptance of gifts or compensation from competitors, vendors, potential vendors, or customers of E.N.D
JEWELRY. Gifts may only be accepted if they have a nominal retail value , but employees are not to accept any
form of compensation. Employees are prohibited from engaging in financial participation, outside employment or
any other business undertaking that is competitive with, or prejudicial to, the best interests of E.N.D JEWELRY. Employees may not use proprietary and/or confidential information for personal gain or to E.N.D JEWELRY'S
detriment, nor may they use E.N.D JEWELRY'S assets or labor for personal use. If an employee or someone with whom the employee has a close personal relationship has a

of interest exists. Employees are encouraged to seek assistance from the General Manager with any legal or ethical
concerns. However, E.N.D JEWELRY realizes this may not always be possible. As a result, employees may

employment is deemed to have a negative impact or creates a conflict of interest, the employee may be asked to
terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain employed at E.N.D JEWELRY. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

E.N.D JEWELRY is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Equal employment opportunity is not only good

protected by state or federal law. Furthermore, E.N.D JEWELRY will make reasonable accommodations for
qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Employees are expected to use good judgment, adhere to high ethical standards and avoid situations that
create an actual or perceived conflict between their personal interests and those of E.N.D JEWELRY
requires that the transactions employees participate in are ethical and within the law, both in letter and in spirit. Employees are expected to not engaged in, directly or indirectly on or off the job, any conduct which is disruptive,
competitive, or damaging to E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that different organizations have different codes of ethics. However, just because a certain action may be acceptable by others outside of E.N.D JEWELRY as “standard
practice,” that is by no means sufficient reason to assume that such practice is acceptable at E.N.D JEWELRY. There is no way to develop a comprehensive, detailed set of rules to cover every business situation, therefore this
policy is intended to outline some basic guidelines to be followed."

consult with their manager. Conflicts of interests or unethical behavior may take many forms including, but not limited to, the
acceptance of gifts or compensation from competitors, vendors, potential vendors, or customers of E.N.D

form of compensation. Employees are prohibited from engaging in financial participation, outside employment or
any other business undertaking that is competitive with, or prejudicial to, the best interests of E.N.D JEWELRY. Employees may not use proprietary and/or confidential information for personal gain or to E.N.D JEWELRY'S
detriment, nor may they use E.N.D JEWELRY'S assets or labor for personal use. If an employee or someone with whom the employee has a close personal relationship has a
financial or employment relationship with a competitor, vendor, potential vendor, or customer of E.N.D

what course of action must be taken to resolve any conflict it believes may exist, up to and including requesting the
employee to tender his/her resignation. E.N.D JEWELRY has sole discretion to determine whether such a conflict
of interest exists. Employees are encouraged to seek assistance from the General Manager with any legal or ethical
concerns. However, E.N.D JEWELRY realizes this may not always be possible. As a result, employees may
contact Human Resources to report anything that they feel they cannot discuss with their manager. ---

NON-FRATERNIZATION

 While the Company encourages friendly relationships between members of management and non-management
employees, it recognizes that involvement in a romantic relationship may compromise or create a perception that
compromises a member of management’s ability to perform his or her job. Any involvement of a romantic nature between a
manager or supervisor and anyone he or she supervises, either directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Violation of this policy
may lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination of the management individual involved in the relationship. OPEN COMMUNICATION

 At E.N.D JEWELRY, communication is at the heart of good employee relations. Employees should share
their concerns, seek information, provide input, and resolve work-related issues by discussing them with their
supervisors until they are fully resolved. It may not be possible to achieve the results an employee wants, but the
supervisor needs to attempt to explain in each case why a certain course of action is preferred. If an issue cannot be
resolved at this level, the employee is welcome to discuss the issue with the Human Resources Manager, General
Manager, or Chief Executive Officer. Regardless of the situation, employees should be able to openly discuss any work-related problems and
concerns without fear of retaliation. Managers and supervisors are expected to listen to employee concerns,
encourage their input, and seek resolution to the issues and concerns. Often this will require setting a meeting in the
near future. Managers and supervisors are to set these meetings as quickly as possible, and employees are expected
to understand that issues and concerns may not always be addressed at the moment they arise. Discussing these
issues and concerns with management will likely help to find an acceptable solution for nearly every situation. If an employee has a concern about harassment or discrimination, E.N.D JEWELRY has set up special
 procedures to
 report and address those issues. The proper reporting procedures are set forth in the Harassment and Discrimination
 policy. OVERTIME

 All overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor and noted on the time reporting system. Holidays, personal leave and other personal absences will not be counted as working hours when computing
overtime pay. Overtime compensation will be one and one-half (1 ½) times the Employee's regular pay rate and will
not include any special form of compensation or bonuses. PAY PERIODS

 Employees are paid on a Bi-weekly basis every other Friday. Day shift employees will receive their
paycheck on Friday. Night shift employees will receive their paycheck on Thursday night after 8:00 pm. When such
payday falls on a holiday or a non-business day, payday will be the preceding business day. If any error

Holiday Market and Its Relationship to Spartan Stores

 Holiday Market is an independent grocer and a member of the Spartan Stores grocery collective. Spartan
Stores is a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: SPTN) that was formed in 1917 by nineteen independent retailers who
joined forces to collectively buy groceries to obtain lower prices. Until that time, each of the independent grocers
purchased food products separately from manufacturers at higher prices and competed with the more powerful chains
(A&P and Kroger) individually. They did not fare well against the bigger chain stores until they got together. Just as with earlier generations of independent grocers, Holiday Market’s membership in Spartan Stores
gives us certain advantages. First and foremost, our Spartan affiliation gives us buying power, and behind-the-scenes
support in areas such as advertising, merchandising, and computerized inventory and pricing. By concentrating our
purchasing through Spartan Stores, Inc., we strengthen our company and strengthen other Spartan markets, thus
insuring low-cost purchasing. As an independent, family-owned local retailer, Holiday Market believes that good people working together
toward a common goal can accomplish anything they want to do. In this spirit, we set our goal to give the best service
we can and to fulfill the needs of our customers. Every action we take should be made with this in mind, as our first
responsibility is our customers. To help us achieve this goal, we feel we must meet the needs of our own associates. We owe our associates
the same degree of respect, loyalty, and commitment we ask of them. We hope to provide opportunities to grow
personally and professionally by providing proper training and a good work environment. We are guided by a strong sense of social responsibility to the community where our store is located and

Holiday Market and Its Relationship to Spartan Stores

Holiday Market is an independent grocer and a member of the Spartan Stores grocery collective. Spartan
Stores is a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: SPTN) that was formed in 1917 by nineteen independent retailers who
joined forces to collectively buy groceries to obtain lower prices. Until that time, each of the independent grocers
purchased food products separately from manufacturers at higher prices and competed with the more powerful chains

(A&P and Kroger) individually. They did not fare well against the bigger chain stores until they got together. Just as with earlier generations of independent grocers, Holiday Market’s membership in Spartan Stores
gives us certain advantages. First and foremost, our Spartan affiliation gives us buying power, and behind-the-scenes
support in areas such as advertising, merchandising, and computerized inventory and pricing. By concentrating our
purchasing through Spartan Stores, Inc., we strengthen our company and strengthen other Spartan markets, thus

insuring low-cost purchasing. As an independent, family-owned local retailer, Holiday Market believes that good people working together
toward a common goal can accomplish anything they want to do. In this spirit, we set our goal to give the best service
we can and to fulfill the needs of our customers. Every action we take should be made with this in mind, as our first

responsibility is our customers. To help us achieve this goal, we feel we must meet the needs of our own associates. We owe our associates
the same degree of respect, loyalty, and commitment we ask of them. We hope to provide opportunities to grow

personally and professionally by providing proper training and a good work environment. We are guided by a strong sense of social responsibility to the community where our store is located and
where we live and work. We will seek to accomplish this responsibility through voluntary corporate and individual
efforts. We share with our suppliers the goal of bringing quality products to the marketplace, and consider them equal

partners in this task. Our goal is to offer consumers state-of-the-art shopping with a service-oriented emphasis. We hope to make
shopping a unique experience worth repeating, time after time/ Holiday Market is proud to be part of the Spartan
family, and pleased to have the opportunity to extend our quality services and products to you and all shoppers in the

communities we serve. Thank you for choosing us as your place of employment. Welcome to Holiday Market. Page 6 of 38

Workplace Searches

For the safety and security of our associates, visitors, customers and property, Holiday Market reserves the right to
inspect the contents of all vehicles, packages, purses, bags, lockers, contains and other items brought onto company
premises or used/possessed while engaged in company business. Under certain circumstances involving reasonable
suspicion of improper conduct (violation of the Workplace Violence and Weapons Policy, violation of the
Alcohol/Controlled Substances Policy, etc.,) the company may request associates to submit to a search of their
personal effects. Refusal to consent to any search or cooperate in any investigation may result in disciplinary action up
to and including discharge. All searches will be conducted with due regard for the privacy of the persons involved. Harassment-Free Work Place

Holiday Market expects all of its associates to conduct themselves with dignity and respect for fellow associates,
customers, the public and others. Each associate has the right to work in an environment free from unlawful
harassment and discrimination in any form, from any source. Unlawfully harassing anyone, including but not limited
to sexual or racial harassment, will not be tolerated. Unlawful harassment is serious and pervasive unwelcome
conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based on a person’s race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin,
height, weight, marital status, veteran status, disability or other protected characteristic. The company prohibits harassment of any employee. Sexual harassment is prohibited because it is intimidating and an
abuse of power and is inconsistent with the Company’s policies, practice and management philosophy. Sexual
harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can take the following forms:
- Sexual conduct that interferes with another person’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or
 offensive work environment. - Personnel decisions (promotion, raises, scheduling etc.) made by a manager or boss based on the associate’s
 submission to or rejection of sexual advances

- Submission to a sexual advance used as a condition of keeping or getting a job, whether expressed in explicit or
 implicit terms. This policy covers associate conduct not just in the workplace, but also at clients’ place of business, and at Companysponsored social events. Holiday Market does not permit harassment whether engaged in by fellow associates,
mangers, customers, vendors or other non-associates who conduct business with Holiday Market. Any associate who
violates this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge. Compliant Procedure for Harassment

Employees who have been subjected to or have witnessed harassment should report it immediately to the Human
Resources Department or to one of the owners. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated
thoroughly, immediately and as confidentially as practicable. Prompt and appropriate remedial action will be taken to
eliminate harassment from the work place. No associate will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith. All management representatives are required to notify the Human Resources Department or a company owner should
an instance of discrimination or harassment be brought to their attention. Failure to do so could result in discipline, up
to and including discharge

No Retaliation

We cannot try to remedy claimed harassment or retaliation unless you inform us about it. Failure to report such claims
prevents us from taking steps to remedy the problem. No associate will be subject to, and the Company prohibits, any
form of discipline or retaliation for good faith reporting of perceived violations of this policy, pursuing any such claim,
or cooperating in the investigation of such claims. If you believe someone has violated this no-retaliation policy,

whom the Company determines has violated this policy will be subject to discipline, including possible termination. Qualified Individuals with Disabilities

Holiday Market complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Persons with Disabilities Civil
Rights Act protecting qualified individuals against discrimination in employment. We also provide reasonable
accommodation for such individuals with disabilities in accordance with these laws. If an employee believes that
accommodation of a disability is necessary to perform the essential functions of a position, Michigan law requires the
employee to notify Holiday Market of this need in writing within 182 days after the employee knows or reasonably
should have known of the need for accommodation. All requests for reasonable accommodation must be referred to
your Human Resources representative. Relatives/Personal Relationships in the Workplace

 1. Restrictions on Employing “Family Members”: Holiday Market is a family-owned business. Therefore, we
 understand the value of hiring and working with relatives. We subscribe to a practice of “full disclosure” when
 employing someone who may be related to an existing associate, and/or with whom that associate has a closer
 personal relationship. This includes blood relatives, relatives by marriage, individuals living in your household,
 or those with whom you have an intimate or personal relationship. The appropriateness of such parties working
 together will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Normally, this individual will be prohibited from working in
 the department of and being managed by their “relative.” Managers who may, from time to time, have relative
 or close friend working in their department will be restricted from participating in employment decisions such
 as discipline, training, or promotions regarding this person. In those cases, a company owner or another
 assigned manager will oversee those personnel decisions. 2. Exceptions for Family Members Employed on Seasonal Basis: Sometimes, a family member will possess prior
 training in a department, such as cashiering or deli, and be hired by us during a holiday season."

Required Customer Service Behaviors

 1. Locating a Product: Approach customers who seem confused for any reason and ask, “May I help you find
 anything?” When a customer requests information on a product area, take them to it personally or call a store
 manager to help them. Do not point in its general direction and walk away. When talking to a customer, give
 them your undivided attention. Answer, or obtain an answer, to all customer questions. 2. Checking on an Item: Holiday Market has built its reputation on customer service. Therefore, when you make a
 promise to check on an item, be sure you do so. This might mean that you have to take their name and phone
 number down to give to a store manager. Research shows that customers remember negative experiences more
 than they remember positive ones."

 number down to give to a store manager. Research shows that customers remember negative experiences more
 than they remember positive ones. Help us build positive customer service experiences by keeping your
 commitment to our customers. 3. Providing Customer Focus: Your total attention must be directed to the customer. The only thing that should
 prevent you from assisting a customer is conversations with another associates when a customer is in ear shot, or
 that you are assisting another customer. Focus on the customer! 4. Avoiding Distractions: Personal conversations with other associates must never interfere with customer service. Also, NEVER discuss controversial topics such as religion and politics with associates while working, and
 NEVER make personal remarks to or about any customer (or employee.) This may cause immediate termination. 5. Building Relationships: Make it personal by addressing customers by their name, if you know it. Help us build
 relationships. Last-Minute Shoppers
Treat last-minute shoppers with courtesy and respect. Never rush a customer. The customer who comes in 10 minutes
before closing time or 5 minutes after you started your shift deserves the same respect and courtesy as the customer
who shops during the middle of the day. Never make unkind remarks to the other store associates about “last-minute shoppers.” Inappropriate comments could
result in disciplinary action. Tips

Customer Returns
Customer returns must be handled by the manager of the department where the product originated. For example, a
cake return should be handled by the Bakery Manager. If the department manager is not available, call the Store
Manager to authorize the return. Never Argue with a customer. Treat them graciously until the manager takes over. Customer Complaints
Regardless of the type of complaint brought to you - LISTEN! Do not interrupt the customer. Be understanding. Thank them for bringing the matter to your attention and apologize for any inconvenience. Explain to the customer
that the Store Manager, or Department Manager will be happy to help them. Create an atmosphere of helpfulness. Show your gratitude for the chance to correct a mistake. When you do so, the
customer will leave feeling satisfied. Service Policy
All of our customers are to receive the same efficient, friendly, courteous service, regardless of race, color, religion,
age, gender, disability, height, weight, marital status, physical appearance or any other characteristic. Do not hesitate
to help a customer in need. Remember, our fellow associates are also customer. Treat them with the same courtesy you would a non-associate. Customer Accidents
Accidents demand immediate action. In all cases, alert the Department Manager or Store Manager at once, regardless
of whether you think medical attention is required. Give all possible assistance to the customer. Under no
circumstances are you to make any promise or statement that would obligate you or this company for payment of
medical expenses or damage. It is very important that you never make a statement acknowledging responsibility. If a
customer’s clothing is soiled, torn or otherwise damaged, do not take it upon yourself to promise payment. In an
emergency, stay with them until it is resolved or until you are excused from the scene. Breakage of Merchandise in the Store or Parking Lot
If a customer breaks an item, approach the customer and put them at ease by saying “Not to worry, accidents happen.”
Tell the customer they should continue to shop, and you will take care of the damaged merchandise. It is very
important that the customer is not made to feel guilty. Accidents tend to happen. Begin the clean-up, but call
maintenance to help/finish up with the clean-up. Store Cleanliness
A clean store attracts and retains customers. All of us need to help keep our store clean. Please try to be aware of any
papers or debris in the aisle or parking lot, and take a few extra seconds to pick them up and discard or put back in the
proper location. The cleanliness of a store is a direct reflection of its associates. Donations
Refer any customer asking for donations or discounts to a store owner or store manager. Associates are prohibited
from authorizing such transactions. Page 14 of 38

Associate Purchases

We want our associates to shop at Holiday Market. You’re some of our best customers! However, because you
are an associate, we require that you follow these rules:

 1. Do your shopping after you punch out: Only shop during breaks/lunches, or at the end of your shift. 2. Pay for it first: All purchases are to be paid for at the cash register before they are consumed or taken
 home. Failure to do so could lead to immediate discharge. 3. Keep your receipt: Please keep receipts for all your purchases throughout the day. We spot-check
 associates to determine if the product you are eating/taking out of the store has been paid for. Associates
 who cannot produce a receipt will be disciplined, up to and including discharge. 4. Take purchases to your car: All purchases for home consumption must be rung through the register and

 relative or person residing in your household, or friend. Please advise them of this to avoid embarrassment. 6. Never mis-price an item: Anyone who labels a more-expensive item as a cheaper item so that it rings up

who cannot produce a receipt will be disciplined, up to and including discharge. Take purchases to your car: All purchases for home consumption must be rung through the register and

Resignation Policy

time earned as of January 1st of the calendar year of employment. Associates who do not provide a two weeks’ notice
and/or who fail to work their schedule will not receive payout for unused time. Layoff Policy

Unfortunately, circumstances may arise that require layoff. If the company, in its sole discretion, determines that a
layoff is necessary, affected associates will be notified of the effective date, pertinent benefits information, and
specified possibility of recall (if any) as soon as it is practical. All layoffs and recalls will be based upon company
needs and associate’s ability, as determined by the company. After 30 days on layoff status, associates will be
automatically terminated. Discipline

injury/death. Accordingly, associates are prohibited from reporting to work in an unfit condition. This includes while under the
influence/impaired by alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances in their system. No associate may possess, sell or
distribute alcohol, drugs or controlled substances while on company property or company time. To prevent controlled substances, drugs, alcohol and other contraband from being brought onto the company premises,

a safe workplace. Associates will cooperate in all investigations of suspected rule violations or workplace safety. Shoplifting

Customer, vendor and associate theft is a serious problem and must be handled by experienced personnel to avoid
difficulties. If you see anyone hiding merchandise in their clothing or in a packaging they are carrying, then quietly

label chemicals that you transfer from their original container to a smaller container (for example, to a mop bucket or
spray bottle.) If you are uncertain about the safety of any chemical/material, or how to properly label chemicals that
are transferred to small containers, then please see the department manager. If something is broken or malfunctioning
you must contact the department manager or a store director immediately. Injury Reporting

 attempt to operate it. If you do so, you will be discipline, up to and including discharge. 4. Fire Suppression Equipment & Exits: Fire extinguishers, inside and outside sprinkler system control valves,
 outside fire department connections and alarm bells, and all exits must be kept clear of obstructions at all times. If
 a fire extinguisher is discharged, even by accident, notify a store director immediately. Once a fire extinguisher is
 sprayed, it loses its pressure and won’t spray a second time. This is why you need to tell us, whenever at

guards are in place. Do not bypass or remove guards, unless for maintenance, cleaning or repair purposes. Safety
laws require power lockout procedures to prevent the unexpected startup of power equipment while cleaning or
servicing machines. This is known as “lock-out, tag out.” If a machine is tagged for repair or lock-out, do not
attempt to operate it. If you do so, you will be discipline, up to and including discharge. Fire Suppression Equipment & Exits: Fire extinguishers, inside and outside sprinkler system control valves,
outside fire department connections and alarm bells, and all exits must be kept clear of obstructions at all times. If
a fire extinguisher is discharged, even by accident, notify a store director immediately. Once a fire extinguisher is
sprayed, it loses its pressure and won’t spray a second time. This is why you need to tell us, whenever at
extinguisher is discharged."

Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy or under the company’s sick leave
policy are encouraged to speak with the Human Resources Department. The company may require an employee to
provide a doctor’s certification of serious health condition. If an employee takes a leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition or develops a condition that
is a serious health condition, the company may designate all or some portion of related sick leave taken as leave under
this policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications. Except in the case of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness, an eligible employee
can take up to 12 weeks of leave under this policy during any 12-month period. The company will measure the 12month period by a “rolling” 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee used any FMLA leave as
provided by the FMLA in its regulations. A husband and wife who are eligible for leave under this policy and are employed by the same covered employer are
permitted to take only a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken:

- For the birth of a child/to care for the child after birth
- For placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement
- To care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. Each time an employee takes leave the company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this
policy and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is
entitled to take at that time. Eligible employees can take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered
service member with a serious injury or illness. A single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of leave entitlement
described in this paragraph occurs using the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee’s first
FMLA leave to care for the covered service member begins. Page 30 of 38

Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy or under the company’s sick leave
policy are encouraged to speak with the Human Resources Department. The company may require an employee to
provide a doctor’s certification of serious health condition. If an employee takes a leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition or develops a condition that
is a serious health condition, the company may designate all or some portion of related sick leave taken as leave under
this policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications. Except in the case of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness, an eligible employee
can take up to 12 weeks of leave under this policy during any 12-month period. The company will measure the 12month period by a “rolling” 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee used any FMLA leave as
provided by the FMLA in its regulations. A husband and wife who are eligible for leave under this policy and are employed by the same covered employer are
permitted to take only a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken:

- For the birth of a child/to care for the child after birth
- For placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement
- To care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. Each time an employee takes leave the company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this
policy and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is
entitled to take at that time. Eligible employees can take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered
service member with a serious injury or illness. A single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of leave entitlement
described in this paragraph occurs using the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee’s first
FMLA leave to care for the covered service member begins. Page 30 of 38

Employee Status & Benefits During Leave
While an employee is on leave, the company will continue the employee’s health benefits. If the employee chooses not to return to work for reasons other than a continued serious health condition or reasons
beyond the employee’s control, Holiday Market will require the employee to reimburse the company the amount paid
for health insurance while the employee was on leave. Under current company policy, employees must make a
premium payment (their weekly payment) to Holiday Market at the same time as a payment that would be made if it
was a normal payroll deduction. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee’s health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of
leave. In the event that a payment is not received, the company will mail a notice of late payment to the employee 15
days before the date that coverage would be dropped, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specific date at least
15 days after the date of the letter. If the employee contributes to any other type of insurance/disability plan, the employer will continue to make payroll
deductions while the employee is on paid leave. While the employee is on unpaid leave, they must continue to make
those payments in the same manner prescribed in the paragraph above, along with health care payments. If the
employee does not continue these payments, the company may cancel coverage during the leave period, or will
recover the payments at the end of the leave period, in a manner consistent with the law. Employee Status After Leave

An employee who takes leave under this policy will be able to return to the same position when leave commenced, or
to an equivalent position as provided by the FMLA and its regulations. The equivalent position will have the same pay,
benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites, and status. Under certain circumstances the company may deny the employee to come back if:

 1. The employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested. 2. The employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee’s inability to attend a necessary
 course or renew a license as a result of the leave, despite being given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill those
 conditions upon return to work. 3. The employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the job due to a physical or mental condition,
 including the continuation of a serious health condition with or without a reasonable accommodation. 4. The employee is a “key employee” and the restoration of the employee would result in substantial and grievous
 economic injury to the company. The term “key employee” refers to any salary eligible employee who is
 among the highest paid 10% of all employees within 75 miles."

If the employee has accrued paid leave (Vacation, Sick, Personal,) that accrued paid leave will be substituted against
part or all of the approved 12-week FMLA. The employee may elect to retain a bank of up to 80 hours of accrued
leave. Leave taken under the company’s long-term disability plan or workers compensation plan is considered paid
sick leave for purposes of FMLA. Page 31 of 38

Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule

The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day
periodically when needed over a year,) or under certain circumstances may use the leave to reduce the work week or
work day, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 weeks over a 12month period. Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatments so as not to disrupt
the employer’s operations. The company may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and
benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule. For the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, the company and the employee must mutually agree to the schedule
before the employee may take the leave intermittently or work a reduced hour schedule. Leave for the birth, adoption,
or foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the birth or placement of the child. The company may require certification of the medical necessity."

The company may ask for you to provide certification of the serious health condition within 5 business days after the
request is made in the case of foreseeable leaves and within 5 business days after the leave commences in the case of
unforeseeable leaves. The employees should try to respond within 15 days of the request, or provide a reasonable
explanation for the delay. Failure to provide certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical
Certification should be provided by using the Medical Certification Form that is available in the HR department. Certification of the serious health condition shall include: The date when the condition began, its expected duration,
diagnosis, and a brief statement of treatment. For medical leave for the employee’s own medical condition, the
certification must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform work of any kind or a statement that
the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the employee’s position. For a seriously ill family
member, the certification must include a statement that the patient requires assistance and that the employee’s presence
would be beneficial or desirable. The company has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to doubt the certification the company will pay
for the employee to get a certification from a second doctor, whom the company will select and who is not a company
employee. The company will also reimburse the employee or family member for any reasonable “out of pocket” travel
expenses incurred to obtain the second and third medical opinions. If necessary, to resolve a conflict between the original certification and the second opinion, Holiday Market will
require the opinion of a third doctor. Holiday Market and the employee will jointly select the third doctor, and Holiday
Market will pay for the opinion. The third opinion will be considered final. Procedure for Requesting Leave

Except where leave is not foreseeable, all employees requesting leave under this policy should submit the request in

When an employee plans to take leave under this policy, the employee must give the company 30 days’ notice. If it is
not possible as is practicable. An employee undergoing planned medical treatment is required to make a reasonable
effort to schedule the treatment to minimize disruptions to the company’s operations. While on leave, employees are requested to report either very 2 weeks or every 30 days to the company, regarding the
status of the medical condition, and their intent to return to work. If the employee does not return at the end of the
leave period, the employee’s notification of his/her intent not to return will be the COBRA qualifying event. The company may request recertification as provided in the FMLA regulations. Military Caregiver Leave
Holiday Market permits a spouse, son/daughter, parent or next related to take up to 26 weeks of leave during a 12month period to care for a covered service member who suffers from a serious injury/illness incurred on active duty. A covered service member is a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard, or Reserves,
who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the
temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. Qualifying Urgent Matters

An employee may take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave for a “qualifying urgent matter” arises when a souse, a parent or
child is currently on or has been called to active duty. Qualifying Urgent Matter leave may be taken for the following
reasons:

Short Notice Deployment: Occurs when notice of the call for deployment is received within 7 days of the deployment. Leave can occur for any purpose and is limited to seven calendar days beginning on the date of a covered military member
is notified of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation. Military Events: To attend a ceremony, program, or event sponsored by the military that is related to the active duty or call
to active duty of a covered service member, and to attend family support or assistance programs and informational briefings
sponsored or promoted by the military, military service organizations, or the American Red Cross that are related to the
active duty or callup. Childcare and School Activities: To arrange for alternative childcare for a child of a covered servicemember, provide
childcare on an urgent, immediate need basis (but not on a routine), to enroll or transfer the service member’s child to a new
school or day care facility, and to attend meetings at a school or daycare regarding parent-teacher conferences, disciplinary
matters or counseling for the service member’s child. Financial and Legal Arrangements: To make or update financial or legal arrangements to address the service member’s
absence, such as the preparation of wills or execution of powers of attorney. Counseling: To attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for the employee, the covered
service member or their child arising from the call-up to active duty. Rest and Recuperation: To spend time with a servicemember who is on short-term rest and recuperation leave during a
period of deployment. These leaves are limited to 5 days for each instance of rest and recuperation. Page 33 of 38

employee agree that such leave shall qualify as an Urgent Matter, and agree to both the timing and duration of leave. Qualifying Urgent Matter Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. Holiday Market will seek
certification of Qualifying Urgent matter Leave the first time an employee requests such leave. Holiday Market will require
employees to provide a copy of active-duty orders or other documentation issued by the military indicating that the covered
military member is on or called to active duty and the dates of service. Additionally, Form WH-384 must be completed in
connection with Qualifying Urgent Matter leaves. Military Leave

The companies will comply with the Uniform Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. S 4301 et seq. pertaining to military leave. As the laws change, or as interpretations of the laws change, military leave
benefits for companies’ employees may change accordingly. No attempt is made in this policy to cover all possible
situations and circumstances that may arise when an employee is ordered to active duty. Therefore, as military leave
situations arise, employees should consult with their manager for current and complete details regarding their military leave
rights as a company employee and should make sure the Benefits Office is contacted regarding any continuation of benefits. Military Leave - Continued

Pension Benefits: Time spent on military leave (paid or unpaid) is not considered a break in employment for pension
benefit purposes. The returning service member who is eligible for reinstatement under USERRA has up to 3 times the
length of military leave (up to a max of 5 years) to make the retirement contribution payments he or she would have
made to establish retirement credit. USERRA does not permit double credit in two retirement systems for the same
military leave. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to purchase credit in company if he/she receives credit in any
other public retirement system, except federal social security system. Re-Employment Rights: USERRA places a 5-year limit (with some exceptions) on the cumulative length of time a
person may voluntarily serve in the military and remain eligible for re-employment rights. The USERRA
reinstatements rights do not extend, however, to employees who are employed for brief, non-recurrent periods with no
reasonable expectation that employment will continue indefinitely. Under certain circumstances employees that are
eligible to be reinstated to their former position unless company establishes that the circumstances have so changed as
to make re-employment impossible or unreasonable. If on military leave for 90 days or less, eligible employees may
be reinstated to their own position or a similar position of like seniority, status or pay. Upon return from military leave,
employees must comply with the current provisions of the law in regards to notification of and time frame in which
they must return to work. These limits are specified in 38 USC S4312 and vary depending on the length of service. COBRA Insurance

In certain situations, employees and their families are offered the opportunity for a temporary extension of health
coverage at group rates where coverage under their plan would otherwise end. If you’re an employee of the company
otherwise covered by the plan, you have a right to choose this continuation coverage if you lose your group health
coverage because of a reduction in your hours of employment, or the termination of your employment (for reasons
other than gross misconduct on your part.) If you choose to continue coverage, you will be required to pay a monthly
premium which will be indicated to you before you make your decision. Spouses/Children: If you are the spouse or child of an employee covered by the plan, you have the right to choose
continuation coverage for yourself if you lose group health coverage under the plan for any of the following 4 reasons:
a. The death of the spouse/parent, b. Termination of the spouse/parent’s employment (for reasons other than gross
misconduct) or reduction in the spouse/parent’s hours of employment, c. Divorce or legal separation, or d. Your
spouse/parent becomes eligible for Medicare. Qualifying Events: Each employee or family member has the responsibility to inform the plan administrator of a
divorce, legal separation, or a child losing dependent status under the plan within 60 days of the event or the date on
which coverage would be lost because of the event. The company has the responsibility to notify the plan
administrator of the covered worker’s death, termination, reduction in hours, or entitlement of Medicare. Length of Coverage: If you do not choose continuation coverage, your group health insurance coverage will end. If
you choose continuation coverage, the company is required to give you coverage which, as of the time coverage being
provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family
members. The law requires that you afforded the opportunity to maintain continuation coverage for 36 months unless
you lost group health coverage because of a termination of employment, or reduction in hours. In that case, the
required continuation coverage period is 18 months."

required continuation coverage period is 18 months. If you become disabled as defined by the social security act at any
time during the first 60 days of continuation coverage following termination or reduction in hours, the continuation
coverage period is 29 months. In additi0on, family members of the disabled individual are entitled to the 29-month
extended coverage period, whether or not they are disabled. Moreover, continuation coverage may be extended from
18 months to 36 months for those individuals who were qualified beneficiaries under the group health plan at the time
of the original qualifying event, where a second qualifying event (death or divorce etc..) occurs during the original

military leave. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to purchase credit in company if he/she receives credit in any
other public retirement system, except federal social security system. Re-Employment Rights: USERRA places a 5-year limit (with some exceptions) on the cumulative length of time a
person may voluntarily serve in the military and remain eligible for re-employment rights. The USERRA
reinstatements rights do not extend, however, to employees who are employed for brief, non-recurrent periods with no
reasonable expectation that employment will continue indefinitely. Under certain circumstances employees that are
eligible to be reinstated to their former position unless company establishes that the circumstances have so changed as
to make re-employment impossible or unreasonable. If on military leave for 90 days or less, eligible employees may
be reinstated to their own position or a similar position of like seniority, status or pay. Upon return from military leave,
employees must comply with the current provisions of the law in regards to notification of and time frame in which
they must return to work. These limits are specified in 38 USC $4312 and vary depending on the length of service. COBRA Insurance

In certain situations, employees and their families are offered the opportunity for a temporary extension of health
coverage at group rates where coverage under their plan would otherwise end. If you’re an employee of the company
otherwise covered by the plan, you have a right to choose this continuation coverage if you lose your group health
coverage because of a reduction in your hours of employment, or the termination of your employment (for reasons
other than gross misconduct on your part.) If you choose to continue coverage, you will be required to pay a monthly
premium which will be indicated to you before you make your decision. Spouses/Children: If you are the spouse or child of an employee covered by the plan, you have the right to choose
continuation coverage for yourself if you lose group health coverage under the plan for any of the following 4 reasons:
a. The death of the spouse/parent, b. Termination of the spouse/parent’s employment (for reasons other than gross
misconduct) or reduction in the spouse/parent’s hours of employment, c. Divorce or legal separation, or d. Your
spouse/parent becomes eligible for Medicare. Qualifying Events: Each employee or family member has the responsibility to inform the plan administrator of a
divorce, legal separation, or a child losing dependent status under the plan within 60 days of the event or the date on
which coverage would be lost because of the event. The company has the responsibility to notify the plan
administrator of the covered worker’s death, termination, reduction in hours, or entitlement of Medicare. Length of Coverage: If you do not choose continuation coverage, your group health insurance coverage will end. If
you choose continuation coverage, the company is required to give you coverage which, as of the time coverage being
provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family

members. The law requires that you afforded the opportunity to maintain continuation coverage for 36 months unless
you lost group health coverage because of a termination of employment, or reduction in hours. In that case, the
required continuation coverage period is 18 months. If you become disabled as defined by the social security act at any
time during the first 60 days of continuation coverage following termination or reduction in hours, the continuation
coverage period is 29 months."
Retail,General Business,handbook,Holiday Market,COBRA,your|coverage|continuation|that|plan,2025-11-18T19:09:41.481211,1014,"In that case, the
required continuation coverage period is 18 months. If you become disabled as defined by the social security act at any
time during the first 60 days of continuation coverage following termination or reduction in hours, the continuation
coverage period is 29 months. In additi0on, family members of the disabled individual are entitled to the 29-month
extended coverage period, whether or not they are disabled. Moreover, continuation coverage may be extended from
18 months to 36 months for those individuals who were qualified beneficiaries under the group health plan at the time
of the original qualifying event, where a second qualifying event (death or divorce etc..) occurs during the original
18month period. Page 35 of 38

## Page 37

An individual who receives the extended coverage period due to a disability must notify the plan administrator when it
is determined that the individual is no longer disabled within the definitions of the social security ace. The law also states that your continuation coverage (18, 29, 36 months) may be cut short for any of the below reasons:
 1. If the company no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees
 2. If the premium for your continuation coverage is not paid
 3. If you become covered under another group health plan which covers your pre-existing condition
 4. If you become eligible for Medicare
 5. If you were divorced from a covered employee and subsequently remarry and are covered under your new
 spouse’s group health plan. 6. If there is a final determination that you are no longer disabled (in the case of beneficiaries who qualified for an
 extra 11 months of continuation coverage based upon their disability.)

COBRA Insurance - Continued

You do not have to show that you are insurable to choose continuation coverage. However, you may have to pay all or
a part of the premium for your continuation coverage. This notice is provided as a matter of information only. It does not, and is not intended to create any contractual, legal
or other rights. Rather, your rights are only as expressly set forth in the plan and in federal/state law. The company
reserves the right to amend and/or change the plan as permitted by the terms of the plan. In addition, a subsequent
qualifying event and initial qualifying event can extend the period of coverage for qualified beneficiaries. For further information about this law, contact your human resources representative. Worker’s Compensation Insurance

In case of injury on the job or occupation disease, Holiday Market pays Workers’ Compensation pursuant to state
regulations. Workers’ Compensation helps cover doctor bills and provides your family with a continuing income
should you be temporarily or permanently disabled. You are required to promptly report any accident, injury or illness occurring while you are at work to your manager no
matter how trivial you think it may be. This is essential. If you do not report an accident, injury or illness, you may
forfeit some or all of your state compensation benefits. Page 36 of 38

not intended to create, and should not be construed as creating, a contract between the Company and
any one or all of its employees. All employees are employed on an at-will basis. At-will employment
means that either the Company or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any
time, with or without prior notice, for any reason not otherwise prohibited by law. Any representation
to the contrary is not binding on the Company unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized
representative of the Company. Please read this handbook carefully. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and
outlines the programs developed by the Company for your benefit. One of our primary objectives for
our employees is to create an environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth. We believe you will find an abundance of resources in this handbook that will help you achieve your
personal and professional goals. Our employee handbook cannot possibly anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise, and
it should not be considered as the only or final source of information. It does replace all prior handbooks
and related publications previously distributed. As questions arise, we ask that you consult with your
manager or a human resources representative for further information about a policy, guideline, or any
other information regarding your employment that may or may not be contained in this publication. As we continue to grow, and as our business environment continues to change, there may be a need to
change the policies, guidelines, and benefits described in this handbook. As such, we reserve the right to

Respect means honoring all the diversity in our work environment and includes coworkers, customers,
vendors, and our communities. It means consideration of others’ feelings, concerns and ideas. “People with humility don’t think less of themselves, they just think about themselves less.”

 “Sometimes when the numbers look right the decision is still wrong.”

Innovation means continually striving to improve our processes, our products, and our quality, and
helping our coworkers do their job better. “Managing only for profit is like trying to play tennis with your eye on the scoreboard and not on
 the ball.”

OUR HISTORY
Both Lunds and Byerlys have a rich history, beginning as Minnesota companies founded by local families. Lunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove’s, a local supermarket back
in 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store
on Lake Street in Minneapolis. Don Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden
Valley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single
Company in 1997. The new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is
owned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr.

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued
prosperity for the 21st century and beyond. MEDIA PHILOSOPHY
It is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or
other public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we
speak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a
Company-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your
location manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding
the media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office. III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
Our Company recognizes and values the benefits of diversity in people, ideas and cultures. Accordingly,
our Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment
free from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a
policy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender,
age, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with
regard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law. Page 6 of 42

This commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including
selection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,
and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all
classifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment. If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or
process that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your
department manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources. You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal
employment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your
complaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be
engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES
Our Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting
discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any
qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such
individual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential
functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a
qualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us
aware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her
position. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue
hardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate
disclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the
confidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information
is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at
management’s discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the
essential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This
policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions
necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE
Our Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are
authorized to work in the United States. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility
Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired with the Company must recertify their employment eligibility by

includes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or
classes of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might
be displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by
reporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It
also includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory

deemed necessary by the Company to ensure that the harassment and/or offensive behavior stops. All
complaints of this nature will be kept confidential with information being disclosed to only those
persons who have a legitimate need to know. All managers must notify the human resources department of any harassment complaints that they

that appropriate and timely action is taken to investigate harassment complaints and respond with
actions that effectively resolve the situation and prevent recurrence of the behavior. False and malicious complains of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as opposed to complaints
that, even if erroneous, are made in good faith) may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL
All employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an
employment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment
relationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you

It is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect
that all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate
integrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of
conduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the
safety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive
discipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all
possible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of
behavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship. For more information, contact your
manager or a human resources business partner. Rudeness to a customer
As a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely
committed to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a
considerate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe
you are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to
treat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be
tolerated. Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift
When you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are
expected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption
caused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in
advance of your shift as possible. Failure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is
inexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action. If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your
supervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment. Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or
manager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of
absence or disciplinary suspension. Page 11 of 42

Taking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is
forbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be
consumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be
visible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and
prosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible. Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not
worked is considered theft and could cost you your job. Working off the clock
We value the work that you do and it’s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you
perform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to
accurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools
accurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be
tolerated and could cost you your job. Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants
You may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including
inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the
job. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee
allowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,
including inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants. We encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or
alcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees
who violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for
assistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked
to submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of
alcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment."

affect your ability to work safely, you should not perform your job duties if doing so will pose a threat to

physical threats or threatening behavior or other behavior intended to cause or causing apprehension
on the part of another employee or customer. Fighting or other acts of threatening or violent behavior
that is threatening to yourself or others or results in injury to yourself or others or damage to property

For more information, please review the attendance policy and/or speak with your manager. Misappropriation of money or propertytheft

Taking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is
forbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be
consumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be
visible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and
prosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible. Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not
worked is considered theft and could cost you your job. Working off the clock

We value the work that you do and it’s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you
perform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to
accurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools
accurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be
tolerated and could cost you your job. Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants

You may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including
inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the
job. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee
allowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,
including inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants. We encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or
alcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees
who violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for
assistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked
to submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of
alcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Any such test will be at the Company’s expense and by a physician and/or
testing facility selected by the Company and in full compliance with state and federal law. If you are under a physician’s guidance and are taking prescription drugs or other medication which may
affect your ability to work safely, you should not perform your job duties if doing so will pose a threat to
your own safety or the safety of others. You must review this with your manager. Fighting, threatening or violent behavior

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. prohibits all forms of violence including, but not limited to, any verbal or
physical threats or threatening behavior or other behavior intended to cause or causing apprehension
on the part of another employee or customer. Fighting or other acts of threatening or violent behavior

customers that exceed expectations and are of the highest value. We expect every employee to adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity and

regulations wherever they do business. Employees may not use a consultant, broker or other third party

calendars are at each service counter. Non-solicitation
Solicitation, posting or distribution of material, handbills, printed or written literature of any kind,
including internet or phone communications, by an employee to another employee is prohibited during
working time and in all employee working areas. Working time does not include non-work time such as ,

HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME, AND EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS
Hours of work, overtime, and employment classifications are explained in detail in the LFHI non-union
benefits summary or your applicable union contract. Note that for overtime purposes, the work week is
defined as Monday through Sunday, or as noted per your Union contract. Questions regarding hours of
work, overtime, and employment classifications should be directed to your location manager or the
human resource department. JOB DESCRIPTIONS
Job descriptions are available for many positions. They contain valuable information about a position’s
purpose, essential functions and primary responsibilities. Ask your manager for a copy of the job
description for your position. As your position changes and evolves, be sure to note those changes on
the job description and advise your manager so revisions can be made. WORK SCHEDULES
In most retail and production facilities the work schedules will be posted in advance. If you would like to
request a change in your work schedule, you will need to notify your manager one week prior to the
posting of the new schedule. Complete consideration will be given to all scheduling requests in
conjunction with consideration for the needs of the business. Work schedules for office positions will be communicated to you by your manager. These work
schedules generally remain consistent from week to week. If you would like to change your work
schedule, please discuss it with your manager as early as possible. Your request will receive
consideration along with consideration for the coverage and production needs of the department. BREAK PERIODS
The Company provides all employees with the opportunity to enjoy paid break periods and unpaid break
periods. Since we have employees who work a variety of shifts, both full and part-time, specific break
assignments will be communicated to you by your manager. To avoid service interruptions, it is
important for everyone to closely adhere to their scheduled break periods. TIME CLOCK USE
If you are in a position that is paid by the hour, you will be asked to record your time by using a time
clock or other timekeeping device. All hours worked must be recorded on the time clock or timekeeping
device; working off the clock is not allowed. It is important that you clock in slightly prior to the start of
your shift so you are ready to work at your scheduled start time. Advance approval from your manager
is required if you plan on working hours other than those that have been scheduled for you. To assure that there is no interruption in customer service, we ask that you do not leave your work area
to clock out until the time that your scheduled shift ends. If you work in a retail or production facility
where continuing operations are essential, please do not leave your work area unattended if there is no
one to relieve you; rather, call a manager for assistance. It is important that you follow accurate
timekeeping procedures for starting and ending times as well as paid rest breaks and unpaid breaks. Your manager will explain this process in greater detail. Your time record indicates what you believe to be an accurate account of the schedule and hours that
you have worked in a given pay period. Misrepresenting your hours in any way, falsifying your time

defined as Monday through Sunday, or as noted per your Union contract. Questions regarding hours of

the job description and advise your manager so revisions can be made. WORK SCHEDULES

TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF AND TAKING CARE OF OTHERS
Let’s face it, we seldom think about the possibility of sustaining a disabling injury while at work. But all it
takes is one little misstep, miscalculation or mistake and your life or another’s can be forever changed. The things that matter most - your health, your family, play time and work - can all be compromised
in an instant. Your personal safety cannot be taken for granted - it’s something that you need to work
at and we hope you will. The information that follows represents our guidelines to help ensure your personal safety and the
safety of others. Please take the time to read this information and discuss any questions with your manager or safety
representative. Did You Know?  Regardless of our job titles, we all have the same three job responsibilities:
 1) Keep the environment safe and clean. 2) Create sensational service for our customers. 3) Do the job you were hired to do. Did You Know?  You can help prevent accidents by correcting a hazard when you see one or telling your
 manager about it? SAFETY RESOURCES
Reporting Injuries - If you’re injured on or off the job, let your manager know right away. If your injury
is work-related, he or she will want to help you and take care of any hazards. Your manager will ask you
to participate in an accident investigation to help us prevent similar incidents. He or she will also
complete paperwork to investigate and document the injury. If you need medical care, you’ll be referred to the designated clinic and be asked to bring back a returnto-work form from the physician. If you have physical restrictions that limit the type of work you can do, your manager may assign you to
a Temporary Alternate Duty (TAD) job until you’re able to return to your regular assignment. This allows
you to continue working during your recovery. Finally, if you’ve missed time, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Once again, your
manager will help you with this process. Safety Committee - The safety committee’s role is to help make your workplace safe and prevent

of these products, you’ll participate in training that covers guidelines you need to follow. For example, we require our customers to present identification to verify that they are at least 21 years
old to purchase alcohol. The cashier or server must verify that the customer is of legal age to purchase
these products. Not following these guidelines can be expensive for you and the Company. You can be subject to costly
fines and legal fees and the Company could be fined and lose its license to sell these products. If you

Retail,General Business,handbook,Lunds Byerlys,WARN,equipment|never|that|before|emergency,2025-11-18T19:09:42.911308,1020," Never remove a tag or lock from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so.  Always check to see that equipment and tools are working properly.  Apply lockout/tagout before cleaning or servicing powered equipment.  Never put hands, fingers or other body parts into running equipment. Emergency Action Plan - At times there may be an emergency situation such as threatening weather,
fire, bomb threat, chemical spill or another emergency when you may be asked to go to a safe area
inside or outside the building. An emergency procedure flip chart is available and posted at each facility. Locate the flip chart at your
location and become familiar with its content. Working with Equipment and Hand Tools - Before beginning work with any equipment:
  Inspect equipment
  Ensure safety guards are in place
  Follow standard operating procedures
  Obey warning signs
  Don’t operate defective equipment
  Lockout/tagout defective equipment
  Report defective equipment to your manager

Lockout/Tagout - Before cleaning, servicing or adjusting any powered equipment that exposes you to
moving parts, you must either unplug or lockout and tagout the equipment. This is designed to keep you
and others safe from the unexpected start-up or release of stored energy. If you work with certain
powered equipment, you’ll be trained on specific lockout/tagout procedures. Apply a lock and tag to any
equipment that needs repair and report it to your manager immediately. Never remove a tag or lock
from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so. Working with Sharp Objects - If your job assignment requires you to use a box cutter, knife, slicer or
other sharp object, you’ll receive training that covers safe handling procedures. Some safety tips
include:
  Verify safety guards are in place
  Cut away from body
  Retract blade before storing or place in knife sheath or holder
  Wear cut-resistant gloves

Did You Know? Never remove a tag or lock from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so. Always check to see that equipment and tools are working properly. Apply lockout/tagout before cleaning or servicing powered equipment. Never put hands, fingers or other body parts into running equipment. Emergency Action Plan - At times there may be an emergency situation such as threatening weather,
fire, bomb threat, chemical spill or another emergency when you may be asked to go to a safe area
inside or outside the building. An emergency procedure flip chart is available and posted at each facility. Locate the flip chart at your
location and become familiar with its content. Working with Equipment and Hand Tools - Before beginning work with any equipment:
e Inspect equipment
e Ensure safety guards are in place
e Follow standard operating procedures
e Obey warning signs
e Don’t operate defective equipment
e Lockout/tagout defective equipment
e Report defective equipment to your manager

Lockout/Tagout - Before cleaning, servicing or adjusting any powered equipment that exposes you to
moving parts, you must either unplug or lockout and tagout the equipment. This is designed to keep you
and others safe from the unexpected start-up or release of stored energy. If you work with certain
powered equipment, you'll be trained on specific lockout/tagout procedures. Apply a lock and tag to any
equipment that needs repair and report it to your manager immediately. Never remove a tag or lock
from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so. Working with Sharp Objects - If your job assignment requires you to use a box cutter, knife, slicer or
other sharp object, you'll receive training that covers safe handling procedures. Some safety tips
include:

Verify safety guards are in place

Cut away from body

Retract blade before storing or place in knife sheath or holder

Wear cut-resistant gloves

Store items securely

Discard razor blades in designated container for disposal

Never attempt to put hands, fingers or other body parts near or into moving equipment

  Never place sharp objects or knives in soapy water

 Did You Know?  It’s everyone’s responsibility - from the president to the deli clerk to the cleaning staff - to
 make sure the food we sell is safe and wholesome for our customers. Working with Chemicals - Chemicals, when used properly and safely, pose no harmful effects. But when
spilled or used without caution, they can present a possible hazard to you and others in the work area. You have the right to know about any chemical you encounter in the workplace. To learn about and
work safely with chemicals, refer to and follow guidelines on the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), listed
alphabetically and located in the Safety Center. You may receive a copy of a SDS by asking for one. If we
do not have a SDS for a product, we’ll request one from the supplier. Labels and SDS - These provide you with important information to keep you and others safe. Take the
time to carefully read chemical labels and MSDS before you handle a chemical. The Safety Data Sheets will tell you everything you need to know about a chemical, including if you need
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). It will also tell you about a chemical’s reactivity level or if the
chemical is stable. For example, if you mix household ammonia and bleach together, deadly chlorine gas
is produced. Never mix chemicals together that are not designed for mixing. If you find a container that
is not labeled, don’t use it and never smell it to determine its identity. Questions about a chemical? Ask
your manager. Personal Protective Equipment - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is designed to keep you safe
while working with chemicals or equipment, or during other work activities. Examples of PPE include eye
goggles, gloves and boots. Questions about PPE? Ask your manager where PPE can be found in your
department. Body Fluids - Cleaning a restroom, cleaning up when someone has been sick, or helping bandage a cut
are activities that require you to take precautions. For your personal safety, always wear gloves and other protective gear to ensure that you do not come
in contact with any type of body fluid. Bodily fluids such as blood, vomit, urine and feces are all
contaminates that may expose you to communicable diseases. Wash thoroughly before and after removing gloves and engaging in these activities. If you come in
contact with bodily fluids, report it to your manager. Working with Pallet Jacks and Forklift Trucks - The use of pallet jacks and forklift trucks is limited to
employees who have been trained and certified to use this equipment. Ask your manager about training

Stretching and Mini-Breaks - Stretching increases flexibility and helps to promote circulation and range
of motion while decreasing muscle stiffness and fatigue. When you do stretches, you ultimately
decrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static
stretching - which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-30
seconds - is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as “warm-ups”
to those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:

  Head/Neck Roll - Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling. Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times.  Shoulder Shrugs - Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles-up, forward,
 down and backward. Repeat 3-5 times.  Elbow Press for Middle Back - Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly
 backward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times.  Back Extension - Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for
 support. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times.  Leg Stretches - While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the
 same with your left leg."

Repeat 3-5 times. Caution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them. Did You Know?  The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe
 lifting techniques. Keeping Your Back Injury-Free - Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from
injury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items. Use these safe lifting
techniques:
  Stretch
  Lift safely
  Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like Shoes For Crews®
 - ask your manager about them.  Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs.  Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting.  Know your limits - don’t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for
 help; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips. Regular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise
program, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises. Page 40 of 42
