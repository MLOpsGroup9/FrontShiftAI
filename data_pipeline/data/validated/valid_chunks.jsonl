The conduct prohibited by this policy includes conduct in any form, whether verbal, non-verbal,\nvisual, written, or physical. This includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, voice mail, Internet activity, text\nmessages, pictures, images, objects, writings, words, gestures, or physical contact. In general, discrimination and harassment can be de\ufb01ned as conduct that disparages or shows\nhostility or aversion toward a protected status. It can take many forms, including: epithets or slurs;\nthreats; derogatory names, comments, objects or visual depictions; jokes or teasing; and other\nverbal, nonverbal, written, visual or physical conduct that is based on a protected status. Sexual harassment in particular can include a range of subtle or blatant behaviors and may involve\nindividuals of the same or di\ufb00erent gender. It can be generally de\ufb01ned as: unwelcome sexual\nadvances, requests for sexual favors, and/or conduct of a sexual nature including, but not limited to,\nsexually-related images, jokes, teasing, uninvited touching or other sexually-related conduct when:\n\n- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of anindividual's employment;\n\n- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis foremployment decisions a\ufb00ecting such individual; or\n\n- such conduct has the purpose or e\ufb00ect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's workperformance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or o\ufb00ensive working environment. Sexual harassment does not need to be motivated by sexual desire to be unlawful or to violate this\npolicy. For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of their gender, gender identity or\nexpression, or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment, regardless of whether the\ntreatment is motivated by sexual desire. Additional examples of sexual harassment include:\n\n- Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:o Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another\nemployee\u2019s body or poking another employee\u2019s body;\no Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults. - Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:o Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target\u2019s\njob performance evaluation, a promotion or other job bene\ufb01ts or detriments;\no Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities. - Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or comments about a person\u2019s sexuality orsexual experience, which create a hostile work environment. - Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered inappropriate simplybecause they may not conform to other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a\nparticular sex should act or look. *The key symbolizes ownership and trust. As a Home Bank*\n*team member, you are entrusted with representing us well.*\n\n---\n\n- Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual\u2019s sex, sexual orientation,gender identity or the status of being transgender, such as:\no Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person\u2019s workstation, tools or equipment, or\notherwise interfering with the individual\u2019s ability to perform the job;\no Sabotaging an individual\u2019s work;\no Bullying, yelling, name-calling.

It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at bank-sponsored\nevents.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [8724, 13560], "sentence_count": 19, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["sexual", "conduct", "such", "other", "physical"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "21e198c75f76ae7b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.372186", "token_count": 991}}
{"text": "Harassment, whether sexual or based on another protected status, is not limited to the physical\nworkplace itself. It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at bank-sponsored\nevents. Calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees can also constitute workplace\nharassment, even if they occur away from the workplace, on personal devices, or during\nnon-working hours. Those in supervisory or leadership positions are expected to have a high level of consciousness\nregarding this policy and must promptly advise Human Resources of any potential incidents of\nharassment or discrimination. Speci\ufb01cally, with respect to sexual harassment, no supervisor,\nmanager, or o\ufb03cer shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that any individual\u2019s\nsubmission to or rejection of sexual advances will in any way in\ufb02uence any personnel decisions\nregarding that person\u2019s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or\nany other term or condition of employment. Individuals must remain mindful that when conduct that may violate this policy occurs, it is not the\nintent of the person(s) engaging in the conduct that matters. Rather, it is the nature of the conduct,\nhow that conduct is perceived, and the impact that conduct has on others that matters. A victim of discrimination, harassment or other similar conduct does not have to be the intended\nrecipient of the behavior. It can be anyone who \ufb01nds the behavior o\ufb00ensive and feels a\ufb00ected by\nsuch behavior. If you believe you have been subject to conduct prohibited by this policy or become\naware of such conduct, you should report the situation immediately to your supervisor, Human\nResources, or any member of management with whom you feel comfortable. This applies whether\nthe party involved is an employee, someone in management, a customer, a vendor, or any member\nof the public with whom you come in contact as part of your employment. Anyone witnessing or\nreceiving a report about possible harassment must report the situation to Human Resources\nimmediately. Home Bank will investigate all reports promptly and fairly and in accordance with any legal\nrequirements. While the Bank will maintain con\ufb01dentiality to the extent possible, complete\ncon\ufb01dentiality cannot be guaranteed, as the duty to investigate and take appropriate action may\nrequire the disclosure of information to individuals with a need to know. If Home Bank determines that discrimination, harassment, or other prohibited conduct has occurred,\nappropriate action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees should also know that if they engage\nin unlawful harassment, they can be held personally liable for the misconduct. Retaliation or adverse action will not be taken against an employee who, in good faith, reports or\nparticipates in an investigation under this policy. Retaliation occurs when an employee experiences a\nnegative consequence because they, in good faith, \ufb01led a complaint or participated in an\ninvestigation. Retaliation is illegal and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination, even if no evidence of harassment discrimination, or related conduct is found. ---\n\nHome Bank takes its commitment very seriously to provide an environment free of harassment,\ndiscrimination, and retaliation, and our policy is meant to ensure employees feel comfortable asking\nquestions or raising concerns. You are encouraged to contact your supervisor or Human Resources\nfor any questions or concerns. You may also seek additional information about harassment and\ndiscrimination from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as the applicable\nstate agency:\n\n- Florida Commission on Human Relations\n- Louisiana Commission on Human Rights\n- Mississippi Department of Employment Security\n- Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission\n- Texas Workforce Commission\nOur commitment to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination is unwavering, and\nit is the responsibility of every single employee at Home Bank to foster a welcoming and respectful\nenvironment that is aligned with this commitment. ###### Reasonable Accommodations\n**Accommodations for Disability**\nHome Bank is committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for quali\ufb01ed persons with\ndisabilities who can perform the essential functions of their job, with or without reasonable\naccommodation, provided such accommodations impose no undue hardship on the Bank. Unless\nyou inform us otherwise, Home Bank assumes that you can perform the essential functions of your\njob without any accommodation. If you are a quali\ufb01ed individual with a disability and you require a\nreasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of your job, notify your\nsupervisor or Human Resources. Whether accommodation is required, whether it is feasible, and the type of accommodation that is\nprovided is dependent upon many factors. To facilitate this process, you may be asked about the\ntype of accommodation you believe is necessary, the functional limitations caused by your disability,\nand/or permission to obtain information from your healthcare provider.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "char_span": [13560, 18810], "sentence_count": 28, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0002", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0004", "keywords": ["that", "this", "conduct", "your", "human"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "21e59d475f216e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.377267", "token_count": 1015}}

To facilitate this process, you may be asked about the\ntype of accommodation you believe is necessary, the functional limitations caused by your disability,\nand/or permission to obtain information from your healthcare provider. **Accommodations for Pregnancy**\nSimilarly, an employee may have a need for a reasonable accommodation due to pregnancy or\nconditions related to pregnancy. In accordance with applicable law, the Bank will work with\nemployees to provide reasonable accommodations, provided the accommodation does not impose\nan undue hardship on the Bank. Such accommodations may include: more frequent or longer\nbreaks; time o\ufb00 to attend to a pregnancy complication or recover from childbirth; acquisition or\nmodi\ufb01cation of equipment or seating; a temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position;\nprivate non-bathroom space for expressing breast milk; assistance with manual labor; and\nmodi\ufb01cation of work schedule. Employees should discuss their need for accommodation with their\nsupervisor or Human Resources so the Bank can work with the employee to explore options. **Religious Accommodations**\nReasonable accommodation for an employee\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, and\npractices may be provided when a need for such accommodation is identi\ufb01ed and is possible. A\nreasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the con\ufb02ict between an employee\u2019s religious\nbeliefs, observances, or practices and the employee\u2019s job requirements, without causing undue\nhardship to the Bank. Employees needing this type of accommodation should speak with their\nsupervisor or Human Resources. ---\n\n###### We Own Our Intellectual Property\nThe protection of con\ufb01dential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and\nsuccess of Home Bank. Con\ufb01dential information is any and all information disclosed to or known by\nyou because of employment with the company that is not generally known to people outside the\ncompany about its business. Con\ufb01dential information includes, but is not limited to, customer or\nemployee information and \ufb01nancial data. If an employee has a question about whether any\ndocument or information is con\ufb01dential in nature, they should treat such documents or information\nas con\ufb01dential unless expressly advised otherwise by HR or a member of management. An employee who improperly uses or discloses trade secrets, con\ufb01dential business information,\nclient or employee information will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment and legal action, even if they do not actually bene\ufb01t from the disclosed information. Home Bank information (including but not limited to documents, notes, \ufb01les, records, computer \ufb01les\nor similar materials) may not be removed from our premises without permission from Home Bank. **Con\ufb01dential Information Regarding Customers and Others**\nYou must take all reasonable measures to protect the con\ufb01dentiality of non-public information about\nus or our subsidiaries and our customers, shareholders and suppliers obtained or created in\nconnection with your activities and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such information unless\nrequired by applicable law or regulation or legal or regulatory process. ###### Con\ufb01dential Information\nThe integrity of Home Bank necessitates that each of us maintain the highest degree of\ncon\ufb01dentiality when handling internal matters. Con\ufb01dential Information includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- corporate planning data;\n- pending projects and proposals;\n- proprietary information;\n- research and development designs and strategies;\n- sales or marketing strategies;\n- business operations, \ufb01nancial data, and conditions;\n- pricing and cost data;\n- computer software systems, speci\ufb01cations, and related data;\n- vendor, supplier, or customer lists and transactions; and\n- other similar information.

Remember,\nat Home Bank we do the right thing (always). Business dealings that create, or appear to create,\ncon\ufb02icts of interest either for Home Bank or you are unacceptable. Home Bank recognizes your right\nto engage in private activities that are unrelated to our work. However, you must disclose any\npossible con\ufb02icts so that Home Bank may assess and prevent potential con\ufb02icts from arising. A\ncon\ufb02ict of interest occurs whenever you are in a position to in\ufb02uence a decision that may result in a\npersonal gain for yourself, a family member, or anyone else with whom you have a close personal\nrelationship. This may include making loans, waiving NSF fees or late charges, waiving document\nrequirements such as \ufb01nancial statements, collateral documents or any other similar matter. **Outside Employment**\nIn general, outside work activities are not allowed if it:\n\n- Prevents the employee from fully performing the work for which they were employed byHome Bank, including overtime assignments. - Involves organizations that are doing or seek to do business with Home Bank, includingexisting or potential vendors. - Involves organizations that are in direct competition with Home Bank. - Violates provisions of law or Home Bank\u2019s policies or procedures. **Acceptance of Gifts**\nYou should not accept entertainment, gifts, services, or other valuables from a third party seeking a\n\ufb01nancial relationship with Home Bank. Nominal items that are a mere token of the relationship and\nnot connected to or a suggestion of any business activity or transaction are acceptable (valued\nunder $200, cash is never acceptable), including Christmas gifts or awards from charitable\norganizations. Nominal items must be within your ability to reciprocate on a personal basis, or with\nlegitimate claim to Home Bank for reimbursement under similar circumstances. Although it is not possible to specify every action that might create a con\ufb02ict of interest, this policy\nsets forth those which frequently present problems. If you have any question whether an action or\nproposed course of conduct would create a con\ufb02ict of interest, you should immediately contact HR\nto obtain advice on the issue to avoid potentially engaging in an undisclosed con\ufb02ict of interest. ---\n\n###### Code of Ethics\nEveryone at Home Bank is required to maintain a consistently high standard of business conduct,\nethics and social responsibility. It is imperative that we behave in a manner that inspires public trust\nand con\ufb01dence. Each of us must strive to avoid situations that might cause a con\ufb02ict of interest\nbetween Home Bank, our customers, and ourselves. Our code of ethics provides guidelines that set\ngeneral directions for our conduct. We sincerely believe that the personal growth and development\nof our employees and our organization depend on continued demonstration of high levels of\nintegrity, ethics and social responsibility. In addition, the \ufb01nancial institution business is regulated to such an extent that many actions\nconsidered unethical in another business may be illegal in our work environment. Criminal penalties\nas well as civil money penalties can be incurred for such violations. In the event you are in doubt\nabout whether some action would violate a law or regulation or this policy, you should ask your\nsupervisor or the Internal Audit Director beforehand.

Home Bank may review or change employee classi\ufb01cations at any time. **FLSA Status - Exempt vs. Nonexempt**\n\n- Exempt: Exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis and are not eligible to receive\novertime pay. - Nonexempt: Nonexempt employees are paid on an hourly basis and are eligible to receive\novertime pay for overtime hours worked. **Full-Time**\nIf you are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week and maintain continuous\nemployment status, you are considered to be full-time. Generally, as a full-time employee, you are\neligible for our full-time bene\ufb01ts package and are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of\neach program. **Part-Time**\nIf you work a regular schedule of 10 hours or more but less than 30 hours per week, then you are\nconsidered part-time. As part-time, you may be eligible for some bene\ufb01ts and are subject to the\nterms, condition and limitations for each program. Some part-time employees may also be classi\ufb01ed\nas \u201cseasonal\u201d and work hours during holiday seasons and college breaks. **Temporary Employees.**\nIf you are hired for a speci\ufb01ed project or time frame and may work an irregular schedule, you are\nconsidered temporary. Temporary employees are not eligible for bene\ufb01ts provided by Home Bank,\nexcept those required by law, regardless of the number of hours worked. ###### We Are Invested in Your Career at Home Bank\nWe like to promote from within the organization. What does this mean to you? It means we\ndeveloped a job-posting program that allows you an easy way to apply for di\ufb00erent positions within\nHome Bank. All you need to do is watch ADP (Myself, Talent, Career Center) for postings. We do\nhave some guidelines around these promotions and job transfers though. You need the knowledge,\nskills, abilities and minimum quali\ufb01cations required by that position and we recommend that you\nwork in your current position for approximately one year. ###### How Do I Access My Personnel File? Personnel \ufb01les are maintained by HR and are considered con\ufb01dential. Managers and supervisors\nmay only have access to personnel \ufb01le information on a need-to-know basis. If you wish to review\nyour personnel \ufb01le, please contact the Human Resource Department. Employee \ufb01les may not be\ntaken outside of the department. Certain documents may not be eligible for review. Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources are limited. However, we must comply with\ncertain requests, including but not limited to subpoenas from authorized law enforcement agencies,\nor local, state, or federal courts or agencies conducting litigation, o\ufb03cial investigations or audits. ---\n\nHome Bank takes seriously its duty to protect the con\ufb01dential information it maintains on employees,\nsuch as social security numbers, dates of birth, direct deposit banking information, and all medical\ninformation. In addition to its own rigorous policies to protect this information, Home Bank complies\nwith all legal obligations concerning the use and storage of this information. **Important Note**\nWe need your help making sure your information is up to date in our \ufb01les. If you have a life-changing\nevent, log into ADP and update your record. This could include something as simple as changing\nphones to having a child. ###### Payment of Wages & Overtime\nHome Bank\u2019s pay period for all employees is biweekly and will be paid every other Friday. If payday\nfalls on a federal holiday, you will receive your paycheck one workday prior to the holiday. You will be paid through direct deposit to either a savings or checking account at Home Bank or at a\nbank of your choosing. You are required to activate direct deposit through ADP prior to your \ufb01rst\npaycheck. You can view your detailed pay information including gross pay, statutory deductions, and\nvoluntary deductions through ADP. In the event of an error in funds deposited, or if there are any\nother discrepancies, HR must be noti\ufb01ed immediately. You are responsible for con\ufb01rming your\npaycheck funds are in your bank account prior to using them. Due to the needs of the business, occasionally you may be required to work overtime.

{"text": "You are responsible for con\ufb01rming your\npaycheck funds are in your bank account prior to using them. Due to the needs of the business, occasionally you may be required to work overtime. Overtime is\nactual hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. Nonexempt employees will be paid time and\none-half their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40. Paid leave such as holiday,\nPTO, bereavement time, sick, extended leave and jury duty do not apply towards hours worked. All\novertime must be approved by your immediate supervisor. Any unapproved overtime hours worked,\nmay result in disciplinary action up to possible termination. Pursuant to wage and hour laws,\nnonexempt employees must be paid for all hours worked and may not \u201cbank\u201d time o\ufb00 in lieu of\nreceiving overtime pay. Business needs may require employees to work on a holiday. Should this be the case Home Bank\nwill pay time and one-half for working on a holiday or will allow the employee to take another day o\ufb00\nwithin the calendar year following the scheduled holiday. ###### Time Records\nWhether you are an exempt or nonexempt employee, you are required to record hours in ADP. Nonexempt employees will use the timeclock and the Time O\ufb00 Request feature in ADP, while\nExempt employees will use the Time O\ufb00 Request feature. These records may be required by\ngovernmental regulations and are used to calculate regular and overtime pay when applicable. If you\nforget a time punch, you must immediately notify your supervisor in order to correct your time. Under no circumstances are you allowed to clock in or out for another employee or clock yourself\nout and continue working. You are also not allowed to use the ADP phone app to clock in/out unless\nspeci\ufb01cally approved by HR. In addition, clocking in/out for work should always be on a work\ncomputer, never on a mobile device. ---\n\nPaid time o\ufb00, tardiness, absences and early departures must be recorded on the ADP time system\nand approved by your supervisor. Managers are required to review and approve employee time in\nADP. Any violations of these guidelines may be subject to disciplinary action including termination. While all hours worked will be compensated appropriately, an employee\u2019s failure to report hours\naccurately in ADP, whether too low or too high, may result in disciplinary action. Nonexempt employees are NOT permitted to work \u201co\ufb00 the clock,\u201d which includes after-hours\ncompany email or cell usage on a personal device. No supervisor or manager shall participate in,\nencourage or even permit a nonexempt employee to work o\ufb00 the clock in violation of this policy. Employees should immediately report any violation of this policy to HR. ###### Work Hours & Breaks\nWork hours are established by each department manager based on Home Bank and customer\nneeds. Generally, you are permitted one hour unpaid meal break each day. However, sta\ufb03ng and\ncoverage concerns may require you to limit your break to 30 minutes. If a nonexempt employee is\nrequired to work through a meal break, they will be paid for the time period. You may also be\nallowed up to two 10-minute rest periods each day, but know that all breaks should be approved\nand scheduled by your manager to ensure proper coverage in the facility. During any unpaid break period, nonexempt employees are not permitted to perform any work for\nor on behalf of Home Bank. Generally, employees may not combine break periods or shorten or skip their meal break to o\ufb00set a\nlate arrival or early departure. Occasional exceptions may be made with manager approval. **Lactation Breaks**\nIn accordance with applicable law, Home Bank will provide reasonable break time for an employee\nto express breast milk for their nursing child for the period of time prescribed in applicable law. Employees should check with their supervisor for speci\ufb01c information, including the location where\nthe break may occur and how to account for the break time. ###### Payroll Deductions & Corrections\nThe government requires us to make certain deductions from employee paychecks. These include\nthe Federal Income Tax (FIT), Federal Social Security (FICA), Medicare Tax, and State Income Tax\n(SIT). Other deductions may be made when required to comply with a court order, such as child\nsupport. The amount of these deductions is summarized on your paystub in ADP and your W-2.

If you leave before the overage is\nrepaid, the balance due may be deducted from your \ufb01nal paycheck to the extent permitted by law. **Deductions in Salary for Exempt Employees**\nExempt employees are paid on a salary basis and are generally paid their full salary for any week in\nwhich they perform work. However, their salary may be reduced at the discretion of Home Bank in\nthe following circumstances:\n\n- Employees who are absent for at least a full day because of sickness, disability, or personalreasons may not be paid for that day unless they have accrued bene\ufb01ts under the Bank\u2019s paid\nleave policies. Their pay will not be reduced if they are absent for less than a full day for these\nreasons, but an employee\u2019s leave balance may be reduced by the amount of time the employee is\nabsent from work, even if the time absent is less than a full day. - Employees who are absent from work for jury duty, attendance as a witness at a trial, or temporarymilitary leave may have their pay reduced by the amount of payment they receive in the form of\njury fees, witness fees, or military pay. Their pay will not be reduced by the number of hours or\ndays they are absent from work unless they perform no work in a given week. - Employees may be suspended without pay if they are found to have violated one of the Bank\u2019spolicies regarding proper workplace conduct, but only in full-day increments. - Employees who work less than a full week during their \ufb01rst or last week of employment will be paida proportionate part of their salary for the time actually worked. - Actual time taken o\ufb00 for Family and Medical Leave (FMLA). ###### Complaints or Questions Regarding Wages or Deductions\nAny employee who believes that amounts have been wrongfully deducted or withheld from his/her\npay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal, state, or local law should report\nthe deduction to HR. In addition, employees are required to immediately notify HR in the event they believe they have\nbeen improperly classi\ufb01ed as exempt from the FLSA requirements, have not properly recorded all\ntime worked, have not been properly paid wages or overtime due to them, or if there is a mistake in\ntheir paycheck or any expense reimbursement, regardless of whether the mistake is to the bene\ufb01t of\nthe employee or Home Bank. Home Bank prohibits retaliation or reprisal against any employee, who in good-faith, raises\nquestions or concerns regarding their pay. ---\n\n# Our Investment\n\n---\n\n```shell\n# Our Investment\n# in You\n# Our Investment in You\n```\n\nAs an employee of Home Bank, you may become eligible for a variety of bene\ufb01t programs designed\nto assist you and your eligible dependents in meeting the \ufb01nancial burdens that can result from\nillness and disability and to help you plan for retirement.

PTO requests must be submitted through ADP and subject to approval by management. Home Bank\nwill try to accommodate PTO requests; however, all PTO requests are subject to availability and\nsta\ufb03ng needs. In an e\ufb00ort to accommodate the desires of our employees who would like to take\nPTO earlier in the year, employees may be permitted to borrow against the PTO they expect to\naccrue over the course of the calendar year. However, if your employment with Home Bank is\nterminated for any reason prior to the time that you have accumulated the number of PTO days\ntaken during that calendar year, you are responsible for reimbursing Home Bank for the amount of\nused but unaccrued PTO. A deduction will be processed for employees who have a negative PTO as\nof 12/31, annually. These deductions will be made on the \ufb01nal payroll, for terminated employees, and\non the last payroll of the year for active employees. Unused PTO at year-end will be forfeited, unless prohibited by state law. Upon termination, all PTO\naccrued as of the previous January 1, and not yet taken will be payable with the employee\u2019s \ufb01nal\npaycheck. ###### Holidays\nHolidays are selected by Home Bank annually and usually follow the federal holiday schedule. Home Bank may also close locations early or otherwise for various occasions. You can view holiday\nupdates on ONENET>Bank Calendar. All full-time employees will receive their regular rate of pay for approved holidays (not to exceed hours). A holiday will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime. Part-time employees who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible to receive holiday pay if\nthat holiday falls on their regularly scheduled day (for example, Sally works 5 hours a day on\nMonday, Wednesday and Fridays. Labor Day is scheduled on a Monday, so that means Sally will\nreceive 5 hours of holiday pay.)\n\nPTO or Time O\ufb00 Awards on the day before and/or after a bank paid holiday should always be\nscheduled in advance and is subject to management approval. If an employee calls in sick and/or\nschedules it as a sick day, a doctor\u2019s note may be required in order to utilize any available sick time. If an employee calls in for personal reasons (not sick and not pre-approved), then any available\naccrued PTO or Time O\ufb00 Award would be used, and the employee would be subject to disciplinary\naction.

Upon receipt of the notice to\nserve jury duty, you should immediately provide a copy of your summons to your supervisor. ###### Military Leave\nHome Bank supports the military obligations of all employees and grants leaves for uniformed\nservice in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. Any employee who needs time o\ufb00 for\nuniformed service should immediately notify HR and their supervisor. If an employee is unable to\nprovide notice before leaving for uniformed service, a family member should notify the supervisor as\nsoon as possible. Upon return from military leave, you will be granted the same seniority, pay, and bene\ufb01ts as if you\nhad worked continuously. Failure to report for work within the prescribed time after completion of\nmilitary service will be considered a voluntary resignation from Home Bank. All employees who enter military service may accumulate a total absence of \ufb01ve years and still retain\nemployment rights. Employees should also refer to the Leave under the Family and Medical Leave\nAct for further rights and responsibilities regarding military leave. ###### Family & Medical Leave (FMLA)\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees the opportunity to\ntake unpaid, job-protected leave for certain speci\ufb01ed reasons. The maximum amount of leave an\nemployee may use is either 12 or 26 weeks within a 12-month period, depending on the reasons for\nthe leave. To be eligible for family/medical leave, you must have worked for the bank for at least 12 months and\nfor at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before leave is to begin. Additionally, you must work in a\nlocation where there are at least 50 employees within 75 miles of that location. *Acorns grow into massive oak trees. Though we start out small, let\u2019s*\n*remain rooted in humility together as we grow into our full potential.*\n\nAdditional bereavement time o\ufb00 or time o\ufb00 for other family relationships, may be requested through\nHuman Resources and the request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Home Bank understands\nthat circumstances vary in times of grief and will work with employees seeking additional time o\ufb00,\nwhich may include requesting personal leave of absence. ---\n\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:\n\n- birth of a child, or to care for a newly-born child (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- to care for an immediate family member (employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent) with a serious healthcondition (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- because of the employee\u2019s serious health condition that makes the employee unable to performthe employee\u2019s job (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness related to certain types ofmilitary service (up to 26 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or\n\n- to handle certain qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son,daughter, or parent is on duty under a call or order to active duty in the Uniformed Services (up to\n12 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details). The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in a 12-month period for all reasons combined is weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a covered service member, the maximum combined\nleave entitlement is 26 weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those\n26 weeks. Note that in cases where the Bank employs spouses, the spouses are limited to a combined total of\n12 weeks of FMLA due to the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child or to care for a\nparent with a serious health condition. Additional parameters apply for spouses who work for the\nBank, so these employees should work with Human Resources to determine exactly how much time\neach spouse is eligible for under FMLA, depending on the circumstances of the leave. **De\ufb01nitions**\nA *serious health condition* is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that\ninvolves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care\nprovider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the\nemployee\u2019s job, or prevents the quali\ufb01ed family member from participating in school or other daily\nactivities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement includes an incapacity\nof more than three full calendar days and two visits to a health care provider or one visit to a health\ncare provider and a continuing regimen of care; an incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal\nvisits, a chronic condition, or permanent or long-term conditions; or absences due to multiple\ntreatments.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0012", "char_span": [54861, 59684], "sentence_count": 23, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0011", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0013", "keywords": ["leave", "care", "employees", "that", "service"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "PTO"], "hash_64": "29c599474b336671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.417922", "token_count": 1027}}

A *covered service member* is a customer or veteran of the Armed Forces, including the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in\noutpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. The term *serious injury or illness* means an injury or illness incurred by the customer in the line of\nduty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the customer medically un\ufb01t to\nperform the duties of the customer\u2019s o\ufb03ce, grade, rank, or rating or one that existed before the\nbeginning of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty. With\nregard to veterans, the injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed\nveteran status. ---\n\n*Qualifying exigencies* include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging\nalternative childcare, making \ufb01nancial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and\nrecuperation, counseling, and post-deployment debrie\ufb01ngs. **Identifying the 12-Month Period**\nThe 12-month period in which 12 weeks of leave may be taken is a rolling 12-month period measured\nbackward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA leave for the birth or placement\nof a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12 months of the birth or placement. **Using Leave**\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks\nof time), or by reducing the normal work schedule when medically necessary for the serious health\ncondition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a covered service member,\ntheir injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for\nmilitary qualifying exigencies. Intermittent leave is not permitted for the birth of a child, to care for a\nnewly born child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Employees who require\nintermittent or reduced-schedule leave must try to schedule their leave so that it will not unduly\ndisrupt the Bank's operations. **Use of Accrued Paid Leave**\nTo the extent you have any accrued PTO and/or sick time, you are required to use it concurrently\nwith your FMLA leave. Bene\ufb01ts received under other income replacement programs, such as disability or workers\u2019 compensation also run concurrently with FMLA and do not extend the period of\nFMLA. However, employees may be able to supplement these paid bene\ufb01ts with available vacation\nand/or sick, to a maximum of 100% of their regular base pay for the week. **Maintenance of Health Bene\ufb01ts**\nIf you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, the Bank will maintain coverage during\nyour FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. You must make arrangements\nto pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave prior to beginning leave, unless the need\nfor leave in unforeseeable, in which case you must make arrangements as soon as possible. In some\ninstances, the Bank may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other bene\ufb01ts for\nyou and your family. **Notice and Medical Certi\ufb01cation**\nWhen seeking FMLA leave, you are required to provide:\n\n- su\ufb03cient information and documentation for us to determine if the requested leave quali\ufb01es forFMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. You must also inform the\nbank if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certi\ufb01ed;\n\n- if the need for leave is foreseeable, this information must be provided 30 days in advance of theanticipated beginning date of the leave.

The bank will require this certi\ufb01cation to address whether you can perform the\nessential functions of your position.

{"text": "Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. **Employer Responsibilities**\nTo the extent required by law, the bank will inform employees whether they are eligible under FMLA. Should an employee be eligible for FMLA, the bank will provide them with a notice that speci\ufb01es any\nadditional information required as well as the employee\u2019s rights and responsibilities. If employees are\nnot eligible, the bank will provide a reason for the ineligibility. The bank will also inform employees if\nleave will be designated as FMLA and, to the extent possible, note the amount of leave counted\nagainst the employee\u2019s leave entitlement. If the bank determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected,\nthe bank will notify the employee. **Job Restoration**\nUpon returning from FMLA leave, eligible employees will typically be restored to their original job or to\nan equivalent job with equivalent pay, bene\ufb01ts, and other employment terms and conditions. **Exemption for Key Employees**\nCertain key employees may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if\ndoing so would cause substantial economic injury to the bank. Key employees are salaried and among\nthe highest paid 10 percent of all employees. The bank will notify you if you qualify as a key employee\nand if the bank intends to deny reinstatement and your rights in such instances. **Failure to Return After FMLA Leave**\nAny employee who fails to return to work as scheduled after FMLA leave or exceeds the 12-week\nFMLA entitlement (or in the case of military caregiver leave, the 26-week FMLA entitlement), will be\nsubject to the bank\u2019s standard leave of absence and attendance policies. This will result in\ntermination if you have no other bank-provided or legally mandated leave available to you that applies\nto your continued absence. Likewise, following the conclusion of your FMLA leave, the bank\u2019s\nobligation to maintain your group health plan bene\ufb01ts ends (subject to any applicable COBRA rights). **Fraud**\nProviding false or misleading information or omitting material information in connection with an FMLA\nleave will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. **Employers\u2019 Compliance with FMLA and Employee\u2019s Enforcement Rights**\nFMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA, or discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice\nmade unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. While the Bank encourages employees to bring any concerns or complaints about compliance with\nFMLA to the attention of management, FMLA regulations require employers to advise employees that\nthey may \ufb01le a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or bring a private lawsuit against an\nemployer. ---\n\nFurther, FMLA does not a\ufb00ect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, nor does it\nsupersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or\nmedical leave rights. **Limited Nature of This Policy**\nThis policy should not be construed to confer any express or implied contractual relationship or\nrights to any employee not expressly provided for by FMLA. The Bank reserves the right to modify\nthis or any other policy as necessary, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law. State or\nlocal leave laws may also apply. **Military-Related Federal FMLA Leave**\nFMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related\nmedical and nonmedical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The \ufb01rst is\nMilitary Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is\ndetailed below. **Military Caregiver Leave**\nUnpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family\nmembers who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty.

Military Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in this FMLA policy (requirements\nregarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice, use of accrued paid leave, etc.). Military Caregiver\nLeave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations,\nand nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations. **Qualifying Exigency Leave**\nEligible employees may take unpaid *Qualifying Exigency Leave* to tend to certain *exigencies* arising\nout of the duty under a call or order to active duty of a *covered military customer* (i.e., the\nemployee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent).

These situations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the law, to\ndetermine if approval of additional leave time can be granted. We will attempt to reinstate employees returning from a leave to their same or similar position;\nhowever, depending on the nature and length of the leave, there may not be a guarantee that we\nwill be able to return an employee to any position upon completion of their leave. In making these\ndecisions, Home Bank complies with all applicable laws regarding reinstatement. Employees who fail to return to work the day after an approved leave ends will be deemed to have\nvoluntarily resigned from their employment. For complete information about leaves of absence, please contact Human Resources. ###### Additional Leaves\n###### The leave rights outlined in this handbook are applicable to all employees, provided they meet\n###### the eligibility requirements for a particular leave (which may include the requirement that the\n###### employee be full-time). States, however, may have additional leave protections that certain\n###### employees may be entitled to receive. If you have the need for time o\ufb00 that is not covered under\n###### a policy listed in this Handbook, please discuss your need with Human Resources so that we can\n###### determine if your request is protected under any additional state law.

Everyone has the opportunity and responsibility to contribute to a safe work environment by using\ncommonsense rules and safe practices and by notifying Facilities when health or safety issues are\npresent. Everyone is encouraged to partner with Facilities to ensure maximum safety for all. Everyone is scheduled to receive safety and robbery training and is required to attend any training\nsession provided by Home Bank that is related to workplace safety and security. In the event of an emergency, notify the appropriate emergency personnel by dialing 9 for an\noutside line, then dial 911 to activate the medical emergency services. All accidents must be reported\nto Facilities and HR. You can report accidents through OneNet>Knowledge>Forms>Facilities>\nAccident/Incident Report Form. Failure to report any accidents may lead to disciplinary action up to\ntermination. Additionally, notify management of any emergency situation, including accidents,\nmedical situations, threats of violence, etc., as well as any accident or injury of a visitor on the\nproperty. ###### Workplace Violence\nWe are committed to providing a safe workplace. We do not tolerate violent behavior whether committed by or against an employee. Violent or threating behavior may take many forms, including\nphysical acts, oral or written statements, email messages, phone calls, or gestures and expressions. Examples include, but are not limited to, intimidation, bullying, threats, physical attacks, property\ndamage, or other direct or indirect conduct that threatens personal safety or property or could be\ninterpreted as an intent to cause harm to person(s) or property. Even casual remarks, joking,\nhorseplay, and unintentional conduct may violate this policy and will be taken seriously.

Kevin Kinyon\nPresident\n\n---\n\n##### Introduction\n\nThis Employee Handbook (\u201cHandbook\u201d) is a compilation of personnel policies, practices and\nprocedures currently in effect at Kinyon Construction (\u201cCompany\u201d); Amongst them is the\nCompany\u2019s Health, Safety and Environment Manual (\u201cHS&E\u201d).

Your employment is strictly \u201cat will\u201d. The purpose\nof the Handbook is simply to provide you with a convenient explanation of present policies and\npractices at the Company.

Our policy reflects and affirms the\nCompany\u2019s commitment to the principles of fair employment and the elimination of all\ndiscriminatory practices. Details of our equal employment opportunity policies are further\nexplained in Anti-Discrimination & Harassment below. Equal employment opportunity will be\nextended to all persons in all aspects of the employer-employee relationship, including\nrecruitment, hiring, upgrading, training, promotion, transfer, discipline, layoff, recall and\ntermination. ##### Employment Policy - At Will Employment\n\nKinyon Construction\u2019s employment policy is \u201cat-will.\u201d Under the \u201cat-will\u201d policy, neither you\nnor the Company is committed to continuing the employment relationship for any specific term. Rather, the employment relationship will continue at will. Either side may terminate the\nrelationship at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice. Also the Company\nretains the right to demote, transfer, change job duties, and change compensation at any time with\nor without notice and with or without cause in its sole discretion. In deciding to work for the\nCompany, or continuing to work for the Company, you must understand and accept these terms of\nemployment. **This Employee Handbook is not a contract.** It does not create any agreement, express or implied,\nguaranteeing you any specific terms or conditions of employment. Nothing contained in\nthis Handbook should be construed as creating a contract guaranteeing employment for any\nspecific duration, nor does the Handbook obligate you to continue your employment for a specific\nperiod of time. Unless you have entered into a written employment agreement that supersedes this\ndocument, either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The Handbook does not guarantee any prescribed process for discipline and discharge. No manager or other representative of the Company, other than the President, has the authority to\nenter into any agreement guaranteeing employment for any specific period. No such agreement\nshall be enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the President and the employee. ##### Recruitment and Hiring\n\nKinyon Construction\u2019s primary goal when recruiting new employees is to fill vacancies with\npersons who have the best available skills, abilities or experience needed to perform the work. Decisions regarding the recruitment, selection and placement of employees are made on the basis\nof job-related criteria. ---\n\nWhen positions become available, qualified current employees are encouraged and are welcome\nto apply for the position. As openings occur, notices relating general information about the position\nare announced. The manager of the department with the opening will arrange interviews with\nemployees who apply. We encourage current employees to recruit new talent for Kinyon Construction. ##### Employment Classifications\n\nThe following terms will be used to describe employment classifications and status:\n\n**Probationary Employees**\n\nEmployees are hired by the company on a trial basis for a period of 60 calendar days for the\npurpose of assessing their ability to perform assigned tasks. Such employment may be terminated\nat any time, with or without cause, at any time during or after the 60-day period if such action is\ndeemed appropriate by the employee or the Company. The 60-day period may be extended by the\nCompany, in its sole discretion, if it determines that such an extension is desirable or appropriate\nfor any reason. **Full-Time Employee**\n\nFull-time employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week that\nare not hired on a temporary basis. **Part-Time Employee**\n\nPart-time employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week\nthat are not hired on a temporary basis. Part-time employees are not eligible for Company paid\nbenefits, with the exception of the 401(k) plan, except as required by law. Any employee who\nworks 1,000 hours per year or more may participate in the 401(k) plan. **Temporary Employee**\n\nEmployees hired for an interim period of time, usually to fill in for vacations, leaves of absence,\nor projects of a limited duration. Temporary employees are not eligible for Company paid benefits,\nexcept as required by law. **Seasonal Employee**\n\nSeasonal employees are those hired into a position for which the customary annual employment\nis 6 months or less. Seasonal employees are generally not eligible for benefits. If your status changes from temporary or seasonal to part-time or full-time, you are considered\n\n---\n\nhired on the date you become a full-time or part-time employee for purposes of calculating\neligibility for benefits that require a minimum term of employment. **Exempt Employees**\n\nExempt employees include all regular employees who are classified by the company as exempt\nfrom the overtime provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and any applicable state\nlaws.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md", "company": "Kinyon Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Kinyon Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0001", "char_span": [5274, 10535], "sentence_count": 34, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0000", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0002", "keywords": ["employment", "employees", "company", "will", "without"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "OVERTIME"], "hash_64": "29c5895747236e6b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.274181", "token_count": 1024}}
{"text": "**Exempt Employees**\n\nExempt employees include all regular employees who are classified by the company as exempt\nfrom the overtime provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and any applicable state\nlaws. Such employees include employees who qualify as exempt executive, administrative or\nprofessional employees or as outside salespersons. **Non-Exempt Employees**\n\nNon-exempt employees include all regular employees who are covered by the overtime provisions\nof the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act or any applicable state laws. Employees in this category\nare entitled to premium pay for work in excess of 40 hours in a workweek or eight hours in a\nworkday. Such employees include, but are not limited to, hourly, clerical, and secretarial workers. ##### Immigration Law Applicable to All Employees\n\nKinyon Construction complies with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 by\nemploying only U.S. citizens and non-citizens who are authorized to work in the United States. All employees are asked on their first day of work to provide original documents verifying the\nright to work in the United States and to sign a verification form required by federal law (Form I1. . If you cannot verify your right to work in the United States within three (3) days of hire,the Company is required by law to terminate your employment. ##### Hours of Work\n\nOur standard workweek begins at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ends at 12 midnight the following\nSunday. Work schedules for our employees are established within this framework. A normal\nworking schedule for regular full-time employees consists of 40 hours each workweek. Each\nemployee\u2019s supervisor will advise the employee regarding his specific working hours and any\nchange in working hours will be announced as far in advance as possible by the supervisor. Punctual and consistent attendance is a condition of employment. Employees must take all meal\nperiods and breaks. Employees must record all work time via timesheet and in/out forms and never\nwork off the clock. As part of our responsibility to our clients, the public, and to other employees, we expect our\nemployees to be at work as scheduled, to arrange their personal schedules to accommodate our\nestablished working hours, and to notify us as early as possible if they expect to be absent or tardy. Employees are expected to be at work, ready to begin work, at the beginning of their assigned\nshift. ---\n\n##### Overtime Hours\n\nEmployees shall be paid for their hours worked in accordance with all legal requirements. Employees who qualify as administrative, executive, or professional employees within the\nmeaning of the state and federal wage and hour laws are exempt from overtime pay and are not\nsubject to this policy. Because of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the\nCompany requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible. Overtime hours by a non-exempt employee must be approved in advance by an employee\u2019s\nsupervisor. Because unauthorized overtime is against company policy, employees who work\nunauthorized overtime are subject to discipline, possibly including termination. Sick time and\nholiday hours paid but not worked are not included in calculating overtime. Overtime is based only\non actual hours worked as required by law. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee\u2019s regular rate for all hours over\neight hours in one workday or 40 hours in one workweek. Overtime is computed on the basis of a\nnon-exempt employee\u2019s total hours worked in a workday and a workweek. Hours paid for that are\nnot worked (e.g. sick days) do not count as hours worked for overtime purposes. Overtime hours in excess of twelve in one workday are paid at double-time for non-exempt\nemployees. Hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a week are calculated at one and onehalf times the non-exempt employee\u2019s regular rate. Hours worked performed over eight hours on\nthe seventh consecutive day of work also are paid at the non-exempt employee\u2019s double time rate. ##### California Meal and Rest Period Policy\n\nKinyon Construction complies with federal and state legal requirements concerning meal and rest\nperiods. The Company recognizes that employees perform at their best when they have the rest and\nnourishment they need. This policy explains when the Company expects employees to take meal\nand rest periods. Any employee, supervisor, or manager who fails to observe meal and rest period policies will be\nsubject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this policy\nshould be reported to any supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Every report will be\nfully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report\nalleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the Company\u2019s investigation of such reports. Any form of retaliation in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md", "company": "Kinyon Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Kinyon Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [10535, 15643], "sentence_count": 43, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["employees", "hours", "work", "overtime", "will"], "policy_tags": ["MEAL", "OVERTIME", "REST"], "hash_64": "38cfed474b667e73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.278733", "token_count": 1021}}

The Company provides a second 30-minute meal period to employees who work more than\n10 hours in a workday, unless they work twelve or fewer hours total, did not waive the first meal\nperiod, and elect in writing to waive the second meal period. Employees should take their first\nmeal period before the end of the fifth hour of work and should take their second meal period\nbefore the end of the tenth hour of work. Meal periods cannot be taken at the beginning or end of\nshifts. Employees will be relieved of all of their duties during meal periods and are allowed to\nleave the office or location of their work in the field.

{"text": "The goals of this policy would be severely compromised by drug or alcohol abuse in the work\nplace. The Company has therefore adopted a strict policy regarding the inappropriate use or\n\n---\n\npossession of drugs or alcohol. There are two components to this policy. The first involves a\ngeneral prohibition against conduct that is detrimental to the objectives of the policy and the\ninterests of the Company and its employees. The second involves methods of detecting\ninappropriate drug or alcohol use, including the testing of job applicants and employees for\nsubstance abuse. 1. General Rules\nEmployee involvement with alcohol or drugs can be extremely disruptive and harmful to the work\nplace. It can adversely affect the quality of work and the performance of employees, pose serious\nsafety and health risks to the user and others, and have a negative impact on work efficiency and\nproductivity. Accordingly, the Company requires all employees to report for work fit to perform\ntheir duties and prohibits the use or possession of alcohol or illegal drugs. All employees must\nadhere to the rules stated in this policy. The use, possession, distribution, transfer or sale of illegal drugs or alcohol, or being under the\ninfluence of drugs or alcohol, is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on the Company's premises\nor while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment owned or leased by the Company. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and possibly including\nimmediate discharge. Any employee who is under the influence of any prescribed medication must advise his supervisor\nof that fact, and the precise type of medication involved, before reporting to work. 1. Pre-employment Testing\nAll job applicants applying for employment with the Company must submit to and pass a drug\nscreening test. All offers of employment are conditioned upon the successful completion of the\ntesting procedure. 1. Reasonable Suspicion Testing\nIn cases when an employee's supervisor or other Company superior has reasonable suspicion to\nbelieve that the employee possesses or is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol and such use\nor influence may adversely affect the employee's job performance, or the safety of the employee\nor co-workers, alcohol and/or drug screening may be ordered. This suspicion must be based on\nany objective symptoms, such as factors related to the employee's appearance, behavior, speech\nand/or other facts. If an employee is on medically-prescribed medication, it is the employee's\nresponsibility to advise his supervisor of this fact before he reports to work. Testing may also be required if an employee is found to be in possession of physical evidence, i.e.,\ndrugs, alcohol or paraphernalia, possibly connected with the use of an illicit drug. Testing may\nalso be required if illicit drugs and/or alcohol are found in the employee's immediate work area. However, it should be emphasized that possession of drugs or alcohol is prohibited whether or not\nit is determined that the employee also used such substances. ---\n\n1. Post Mishap Testing\nAlcohol and/or drug screening may be required following any work-related accident or any\nviolation of safety precautions or standards, whether or not an injury resulted from such accident\nor violation. 1. Testing\nViolation of this policy or failure to cooperate fully with any request to test may result in\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination. The Company will pay the full cost of any\ntesting that it has requested of an applicant or employee, including the reasonable cost of any\ntransportation to and from the designated testing facility. ##### Safety and Accident Rules\n\nSafety is a joint venture at Kinyon Construction.

This consent will also need to have documentation with electronic\nbackup and must be approved prior to the purchase of any tools. ##### Leave\n\n##### Religious Observance\n\nFederal and state equal opportunity laws generally require employers to accommodate the religious\nbeliefs of employees, but do not require them to provide paid leave. The Company respects your\nreligious beliefs; therefore, employees who require time off may use personal days. This leave\nmust be requested through the department manager two weeks prior to the event, and may be\ndeclined, only if causing the Company undue hardship. ***Procedure***\n\nRequests for time off should be submitted to your supervisor as soon as you know when you wish\nto schedule your time off, but in no event less than two weeks prior to the time requested. Time\noff requests are approved by your immediate supervisor. This is coordinated so that sufficient staff\nis available to provide adequate coverage at all times, and there may be Company-wide or\ndepartment-specific \u201cblackout dates,\u201d as necessary. Time off requests are granted on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis. In the event of a conflict in requests, your supervisor will consider the\nCompany\u2019s staffing needs during the relevant period, as well as the length of service with the\nCompany of the employees involved. ##### Personal/Sick Leave\n\nA. Eligibility\n\nAn employee qualifies to accrue paid sick leave under this policy upon the start of the employee\u2019s\nemployment or July 1, 2015, whichever is later. B. Leave Benefit\n\nEmployees accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours of work performed. Unless a\nlocal ordinance requires otherwise, employees may not accrue more than 24 hours or three\nregularly-scheduled workdays of paid sick leave, whichever is greater, at any given time. ---\n\nEmployees who reach the applicable cap will cease to accrue further paid sick leave hours until\npaid sick leave is used, at which point the employee will continue to accrue additional paid sick\nleave up to the cap. Paid sick leave not used in a year otherwise carries over from year to year. C. Leave Usage\n\nEmployees may take the greater of 24 hours or three regularly-scheduled workdays\u2019 worth of paid\nsick leave per leave year for any of the qualifying reasons discussed below, as well as any reasons\nallowed for under an applicable local paid sick leave ordinance. For the purposes of this policy,\nthe leave year is the employee\u2019s anniversary year. Paid sick leave may be used for the diagnosis, care (including preventive care), or treatment of an\nexisting health condition of an employee and certain family members of the employee. A family member includes a child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or\nsibling. For purposes of this policy, a \u201cchild\u201d means a biological or adopted child, a foster child, a\nstep-child, a legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis (in the place of a\nparent).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md", "company": "Kinyon Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Kinyon Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0014", "char_span": [71839, 76784], "sentence_count": 33, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0013", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0015", "keywords": ["leave", "paid", "employees", "sick", "company"], "policy_tags": ["MEAL", "SICK LEAVE"], "hash_64": "3bc9a9476f21687b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.334819", "token_count": 1012}}
{"text": "For purposes of this policy, a \u201cchild\u201d means a biological or adopted child, a foster child, a\nstep-child, a legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis (in the place of a\nparent). Similarly, a \u201cparent\u201d under this policy means a biological or adoptive parent, a foster\nparent, a step-parent, an employee\u2019s legal guardian, a legal guardian of an employee\u2019s spouse or\ndomestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. Employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking also may use paid\nsick leave for treatment, assistance, and other purposes authorized by law. Employees using paid sick leave must do so in minimum increments of two hours. Employees will\nbe paid for sick leave not later than the payday for the next regular payroll period after the sick\nleave was taken. Finally, an employee will not be required to search for or find a replacement if\nthe employee is taking paid sick leave under this policy. D. Compensation for Sick Leave\n\nPaid sick days ordinarily are paid at the employee\u2019s normal rate of pay earned during regular work\nhours. Accrued, unused paid sick leave is not paid out upon termination or resignation. However,\nemployees separating from employment who are rehired within one year from the date of\nseparation will have their previously accrued and unused paid sick days reinstated. The employee\nalso will begin accruing paid sick leave upon re-hire (assuming the employee\u2019s bank is below the\napplicable cap). In addition, if the employee is re-hired within one year from the date of separation,\nany number of days that the employee previously worked for the Company will be credited toward\nthe 90 calendar days that an employee must have worked for the Company before being eligible\nto use paid sick leave under this policy. E. Approval\n\nIf the need for paid sick leave is foreseeable (e.g., scheduled routine medical appointments), the\nemployee must provide reasonable advance notice. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee\n\n---\n\nmust provide notice of the leave as soon as practical. When requesting sick leave, employees\nshould not disclose any private medical information or any other confidential personal information. F. Non-Retaliation or Discrimination\n\nThe Company strictly prohibits any form of retaliation or discrimination against an employee for\nattempting to use or using paid sick leave under this policy, and for any other reason prohibited by\napplicable law. ***Notification Procedures***\n\nWhen you are absent from work and your absence has not been previously scheduled, you must\npersonally notify your immediate supervisor or manager as soon as you are aware that you will be\nlate or unable to report to work. Leaving a voicemail or message with another staff member does\nnot qualify as notifying your supervisor. When absence is due to illness, the Company reserves the right to require appropriate medical\ndocumentation. Such documentation need only include the employee\u2019s name, the date and time\nthe employee was seen, and if applicable, a specific instruction regarding the employee\u2019s\nincapacity to perform his or her job. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness can result in discipline,\nup to and including discharge. (Also see the section on Family & Medical Leave for extended\nleave situations.)\n\nIf you are absent because of an accident or you are absent for longer than seven (7) days due to\nillness, compensation is paid under the benefits of the Company\u2019s short-term disability plan,\nprovided you are eligible for and participate in that plan. ##### Military Service Leave\n\nEmployees serving in the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,\nCoast Guard and Public Health Service commissioned corps, as well as the reserve components of\neach of these services, may take unpaid military leave, as needed, to enable them to fulfill their\nobligations as service members. Service members must provide advance written or verbal notice\nto the Company for all military duty, unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded\nby military necessity. Employees should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under\nthe circumstances. In addition, employees may, but are not required to, use accrued personal days\nwhile performing military duty. ##### Family and Medical Leave\n\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows certain employees to take up to weeks of unpaid leave per year for the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate\nfamily member, or for childbirth or adoption. An employee who assumes the role of caring for a\nchild is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological\nrelationship. Either day-to-day care or financial support may establish a parental relationship when\nthe employee intends to assume the responsibilities of a parent with regard to a child. The Human\nResources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid\n\n---\n\nleave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md", "company": "Kinyon Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Kinyon Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0015", "char_span": [76784, 81903], "sentence_count": 33, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0014", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0016", "keywords": ["leave", "employee", "paid", "sick", "employees"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "SICK LEAVE"], "hash_64": "2bc9a9476f226e7b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.339788", "token_count": 1022}}
{"text": "The Human\nResources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid\n\n---\n\nleave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave. To take FMLA leave, you must provide the Company with appropriate notice. If you know in\nadvance that you will need FMLA leave, you must notify the Human Resources Department at\nleast 30 days in advance. If you learn of your need for leave less than 30 days in advance, you\nmust give notice as soon as you can (generally either the day you learn of the need or the next\nwork day). When you need FMLA leave unexpectedly (for example, if a family member is injured\nin an accident), you must inform the Human Resources Department as soon as you can. ##### Military Caregiver Leave\n\nThe FMLA also allows an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of\nkin of a member of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves or of certain recent veterans\nwith a serious illness or injury, up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period to care\nfor the injured or ill service member or veteran. A \u201cserious illness or injury\u201d is generally an injury\nor illness incurred by the covered service member in the line of duty on active duty (or that existed\nbefore the beginning of the member\u2019s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty\non active duty) that may render the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of the\nmember\u2019s office, grade, rank, or rating. An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave\nand leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason in a single 12-month period, provided that the\nemployee may not take more than 12 weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason during\nthis period. (For example, in the single 12-month period an employee could take 12 weeks of\nFMLA leave to care for a newborn child and 14 weeks of military caregiver leave, but could not\ntake 16 weeks of leave to care for a newborn child and 10 weeks of military caregiver leave.)\nGenerally, you must give the Company at least 30 days\u2019 notice before the commencement of any\nmilitary caregiver leave. ##### Qualifying (Military) Exigency Leave\n\nThe FMLA also provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period when an\neligible employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on (or has been notified of an impending\ncall to) \u201ccovered active duty\u201d in the Armed Forces. (\u201cCovered active duty\u201d for members of a\nregular component of the Armed Forces means duty during deployment of the member with the\nArmed Forces to a foreign country. \u201cCovered active duty\u201d for members of the U.S. National Guard\nand Reserves means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign\ncountry under a call or order to active duty in a contingency operation.) The leave may also be\nextended to the family members of certain retired military. This leave may be used to take care of\nsuch things as child care or financial and legal arrangements necessitated by the deployment of the\nfamily member. ##### Break Time for Nursing Mothers\n\nThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employees to take reasonable, unpaid break\ntime to express breast milk as needed for up to one (1) year after the birth of a child. The Company\n\n---\n\nwill provide a place for the employee to express breast milk, other than a bathroom, that is shielded\nfrom view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public. Employees will not be\ndischarged or in any other manner discriminated against in exercising their rights under this\npolicy. ##### Civic Duty Leave\n\n##### Jury Duty\n\nKinyon Construction encourages employees to fulfill their civic duties. To that end, employees\nwill be allowed leave to serve on a jury, if summoned. We request that you bring in a copy of your\nsummons notice as soon as you receive it, so that we may keep it on file. If you are called during\na particularly busy period, we may ask you to request a postponement. The Company will provide\nadditional documentation in this regard, if necessary, to obtain such postponement. Jury duty can last from a portion of a single day to several months or more. During this time you\nwill be considered on a leave of absence and will be entitled to continue to participate in insurance\nand other benefits as if you were working. While serving on jury duty, you are expected to call in\nto your supervisor periodically to keep him or her apprised of your status. ##### Appearance as a Witness\n\nAn employee called to appear as a witness will be permitted time off to appear, but without pay. Employees will be permitted to use accrued personal days when appearing as witnesses.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md", "company": "Kinyon Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Kinyon Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0016", "char_span": [81903, 86616], "sentence_count": 28, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0015", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_Kinyon_Construction.md_chunk_0017", "keywords": ["leave", "will", "duty", "that", "fmla"], "policy_tags": ["FLSA", "FMLA"], "hash_64": "39eba9474f236a79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.344424", "token_count": 1021}}

Employees will be permitted to use accrued personal days when appearing as witnesses. ##### Voting\n\nKinyon Construction encourages all employees to vote. Most polling facilities for elections for\npublic office are scheduled to accommodate working voters. The Company, therefore, requests\nthat employees schedule their voting for before or after their work shift. An employee who expects\na conflict, however, should notify his or her supervisor, in advance, so that schedules can be\nadjusted if necessary. ---\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n\n##### Leaving the Company\n\nIf you wish to resign your employment with Kinyon Construction, you are requested to notify your\nmanager of your anticipated departure date at least two (2) weeks in advance. This notice should\nbe in the form of a written note or letter. The Company asks all employees to participate in an exit interview with their immediate\nsupervisor prior to leaving the Company. This provides an opportunity to return parking passes,\nkeys and other property and to tie up any loose ends. You will receive preliminary information at\nthat time regarding continuation coverage and any other continuation of benefits for which you\nmay be eligible. If you leave the Company in good standing, you may be considered for reemployment at a later\ndate. However, in the case of rehiring, you may be considered a new employee with respect to\npersonal days, benefits and seniority. ---\n\n##### Contacts\n\n***President***\nKevin Kinyon\n[Kevin@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Kevin@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Kevin@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Office Manager***\n\nMary Miller\n[Mary@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Mary@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Mary@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Public Works Supervisor***\n\nManley McNinch\n[Manley@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Manley@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Manley@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Industrial Supervisor***\n\nAdam Harleman\n[Adam@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Adam@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Adam@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Estimating Supervisor***\n\nScott Kinman\n[Scottk@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Scottk@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Scottk@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Fleet/Yard Supervisor***\n\nScot Miller\n[Fleet@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Fleet@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Fleet@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Electrical Supervisor***\n\nPatric Holloway\n[Pat@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Pat@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Pat@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Human Resources Manager***\n\nJohn Wood\n[John@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:John@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:John@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Hawaiian Operations***\nJuan Carlos Ramirez-Galan\n[Carlos@kinyonconstruction.com](mailto:Carlos@kinyonconstruction.com)[](mailto:Carlos@kinyonconstruction.com)\n\n***Safety Officers***\nAdam Harleman\n\nJohn Wood\n\n***Kinyon Offices***\n1533 W.

Holiday Market was founded by Tom and Janet Violante in 1954, and has been a\nRoyal Oak institution ever since. It started as a typical corner \u201cMa and Pa store\u201d of the 1950\u2019s. Yet Tom Sr. had a dream to operate a modern grocery store and the goal to be the number\none grocery store in Royal Oak. Tom was innovative, ambitious and hardworking. He worked\nday and night thinking of new food concepts, like our submarine sandwich, chicken roaster and\nhandmade pizzas. Holiday Market was open seven days a week, including holidays and stayed\nopen to midnight, something unheard of in the \u201850s, \u201860s, and \u201870s. Tom embodied the phrase\n\u201cCustomer Service.\u201d His philosophy was to treat the customer as an invited guest into your\nhome. In 1969, Tom realized his dream of having a modern grocery store when Holiday\nMarket opened its doors at its present location. With a $1 million expansion project in 1993, we\nwere able to expand the Dairy, Deli, Seafood, and Produce departments. He even added a\nBakery, Floral and Catering department! Pride, professionalism, selection and service are the\nwatchwords at Holiday Market. We are proud to have won several \u201cBest Of\u201d awards. Celebrating over 60 years of servicing our community with pride and pleasure, we are still\ngrowing. With the expansion in 2007, our store grew to over 60,000 square feet, and we\ncontinue to improve every day. Our core values are posted on our sign for everyone to see: *Value, Service, Family,*\n*Community, Variety and Knowledge.* We are dedicated to providing excellent customer service,\ngreat food, and a pleasant shopping experience. If we don\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t need itOr we\nwill get it for you. We provide our customers more than just great food: We provide friendship\nand satisfaction of their wants and needs. Our managers are knowledgeable and experts in their departments. They are ready\nto assist our customers with their menu planning, meal preparation, baking and catering needs. Founded on the ideals of quality and personal service in 1954, when Tom and Janet\nnamed their store after the film \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d that commitment has been the heart of years of growth and expansion. The tradition of pride and professionalism continues today\nunder the leadership of a second-generation family.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0000", "char_span": [0, 4969], "sentence_count": 26, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": null, "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0001", "keywords": ["leave", "store", "holiday", "policy", "customer"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "FMLA", "HARASSMENT", "MEAL", "OVERTIME"], "hash_64": "3acfa8456b736f79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.130954", "token_count": 1009}}

Spartan\n\nStores is a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: SPTN) that was formed in 1917 by nineteen independent retailers who\n\njoined forces to collectively buy groceries to obtain lower prices. Until that time, each of the independent grocers\n\npurchased food products separately from manufacturers at higher prices and competed with the more powerful chains\n\n(A&P and Kroger) individually. They did not fare well against the bigger chain stores until they got together. Just as with earlier generations of independent grocers, Holiday Market\u2019s membership in Spartan Stores\n\ngives us certain advantages. First and foremost, our Spartan affiliation gives us buying power, and behind-the-scenes\n\nsupport in areas such as advertising, merchandising, and computerized inventory and pricing. By concentrating our\n\npurchasing through Spartan Stores, Inc., we strengthen our company and strengthen other Spartan markets, thus\n\ninsuring low-cost purchasing. As an independent, family-owned local retailer, Holiday Market believes that good people working together\n\ntoward a common goal can accomplish anything they want to do. In this spirit, we set our goal to give the best service\n\nwe can and to fulfill the needs of our customers. Every action we take should be made with this in mind, as our first\n\nresponsibility is our customers. To help us achieve this goal, we feel we must meet the needs of our own associates. We owe our associates\n\nthe same degree of respect, loyalty, and commitment we ask of them. We hope to provide opportunities to grow\n\npersonally and professionally by providing proper training and a good work environment. We are guided by a strong sense of social responsibility to the community where our store is located and\n\nwhere we live and work. We will seek to accomplish this responsibility through voluntary corporate and individual\n\nefforts. We share with our suppliers the goal of bringing quality products to the marketplace, and consider them equal\n\npartners in this task. Our goal is to offer consumers state-of-the-art shopping with a service-oriented emphasis. We hope to make\n\nshopping a unique experience worth repeating, time after time/ Holiday Market is proud to be part of the Spartan\n\nfamily, and pleased to have the opportunity to extend our quality services and products to you and all shoppers in the\n\ncommunities we serve. ##### Thank you for choosing us as your place of employment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0001", "char_span": [4969, 9969], "sentence_count": 33, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0000", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0002", "keywords": ["your", "holiday", "customers", "this", "market"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "33efc94647674e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.135478", "token_count": 1010}}

{"text": "We prohibit the possession/use of weapons on company time or property, including weapons that may be stored in any\n\nvehicles that come onto company premises or you use to commute to work. The policy also applies at all times and in\n\nall places when an associate is on company business.

Refusal to consent to any search or cooperate in any investigation may result in disciplinary action up\nto and including discharge. All searches will be conducted with due regard for the privacy of the persons involved. ##### Harassment-Free Work Place\n\nHoliday Market expects all of its associates to conduct themselves with dignity and respect for fellow associates,\ncustomers, the public and others. Each associate has the right to work in an environment free from unlawful\nharassment and discrimination in any form, from any source. Unlawfully harassing anyone, including but not limited\nto sexual or racial harassment, will not be tolerated. Unlawful harassment is serious and pervasive unwelcome\nconduct, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based on a person\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin,\nheight, weight, marital status, veteran status, disability or other protected characteristic. The company prohibits harassment of any employee. Sexual harassment is prohibited because it is intimidating and an\nabuse of power and is inconsistent with the Company\u2019s policies, practice and management philosophy. Sexual\nharassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct\nof a sexual nature. **Sexual harassment can take the following forms:**\n--- Sexual conduct that interferes with another person\u2019s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or\noffensive work environment. --- Personnel decisions (promotion, raises, scheduling etc.) made by a manager or boss based on the associate\u2019s\nsubmission to or rejection of sexual advances\n\n--- Submission to a sexual advance used as a condition of keeping or getting a job, whether expressed in explicit or\nimplicit terms. This policy covers associate conduct not just in the workplace, but also at clients\u2019 place of business, and at Companysponsored social events. Holiday Market does not permit harassment whether engaged in by fellow associates,\nmangers, customers, vendors or other non-associates who conduct business with Holiday Market. Any associate who\nviolates this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge. ##### Compliant Procedure for Harassment\n\nEmployees who have been subjected to or have witnessed harassment should report it immediately to the Human\nResources Department or to one of the owners. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated\nthoroughly, immediately and as confidentially as practicable. Prompt and appropriate remedial action will be taken to\neliminate harassment from the work place. No associate will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith. All management representatives are required to notify the Human Resources Department or a company owner should\nan instance of discrimination or harassment be brought to their attention. Failure to do so could result in discipline, up\nto and including discharge\n\n---\n\n##### No Retaliation\n\nWe cannot try to remedy claimed harassment or retaliation unless you inform us about it.

All requests for reasonable accommodation must be referred to\nyour Human Resources representative. ##### Relatives/Personal Relationships in the Workplace\n\n1. Restrictions on Employing \u201cFamily Members\u201d: Holiday Market is a family-owned business. Therefore, we\nunderstand the value of hiring and working with relatives.

This includes blood relatives, relatives by marriage, individuals living in your household,\nor those with whom you have an intimate or personal relationship. The appropriateness of such parties working\ntogether will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Normally, this individual will be prohibited from working in\nthe department of and being managed by their \u201crelative.\u201d Managers who may, from time to time, have relative\nor close friend working in their department will be restricted from participating in employment decisions such\nas discipline, training, or promotions regarding this person. In those cases, a company owner or another\nassigned manager will oversee those personnel decisions. 1. Exceptions for Family Members Employed on Seasonal Basis: Sometimes, a family member will possess prior\ntraining in a department, such as cashiering or deli, and be hired by us during a holiday season. In those limited\ncircumstances, they may be permitted to work in a department managed by their family member, as determined\non a case-by-case basis. ---\n\n##### Computers, Internet, Cell Phones and Electronic Communications\n\nComputer Systems are Company Property: Some associates\u2019 jobs require the use of a computer, voicemail and other\nelectronic communications. The use of such tools is encouraged because they can make communication more efficient\nand they can be sources of information about company business, the industry, customers, vendors, new products and\nservices. However, Holiday Market\u2019s computers, software, electronic mail system (email), faxes online internet access\nservices, and voicemail system are the property of the company and are intended to be solely to facilitate and support\nCompany business. Non-job-related use (including, but not limited to personal emails, chain letter emails, faxes and\ncomputer games) or use by non-associates is prohibited.

The customers!!! To keep our customers\nhappy these are some things you should know about customer service. #### The Customer\n#### wants to feel\n#### welcomed\n\n## So focus on the\n## customer. ## Always greet\n## them with a\n## hello, and always\n## a smile! #### End with a thank\n#### you and a smile. If a customer looks confused,\nlost or asks where something\nis, walk them to it. Never say\n\"I don't know.\" Find someone\nwho knows or call for a store\nmanager. ##### Before leaving a\n##### customer always ask,\n##### \"May I help you with\n##### anything else?\"\n\n## Serve all\n## customers\n## promptly. No\n## one likes waiting\n\n##### And as always follow\n##### the \"Golden Rule,\"\n##### Treat everyone with\n##### respect. **REMEMBER OUR GUESTS!**\n**G:** Great customer service\n\n**U:** Use sense of urgency when helping customers\n\n**E:** Engage in eye contact when talking to customers\n\n**S:** Speak and smile to customers\n\n**T:** Thank customers and end with, *\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d*\n\n| REMEMBER OUR GUESTS! G: Great customer service\nU: Use sense of urgency when helping customers\nE: Engage in eye contact when talking to customers\nS: Speak and smile to customers\nT: Thank customers and end with, \u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d | |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n\n---\n\n##### Required Customer Service Behaviors\n\n1. **Locating a Product:** Approach customers who seem confused for any reason and ask, \u201cMay I help you find\nanything?\u201d When a customer requests information on a product area, take them to it personally or call a store\nmanager to help them. Do not point in its general direction and walk away. When talking to a customer, give\nthem your undivided attention. Answer, or obtain an answer, to all customer questions. 1. **Checking on an Item:** Holiday Market has built its reputation on customer service. Therefore, when you make a\npromise to check on an item, be sure you do so. This might mean that you have to take their name and phone\nnumber down to give to a store manager. Research shows that customers remember negative experiences more\nthan they remember positive ones. Help us build positive customer service experiences by keeping your\ncommitment to our customers. 1. **Providing Customer Focus:** Your total attention must be directed to the customer. The only thing that should\nprevent you from assisting a customer is conversations with another associates when a customer is in ear shot, or\nthat you are assisting another customer. Focus on the customer! 1. **Avoiding Distractions:** Personal conversations with other associates must never interfere with customer service. Also, NEVER discuss controversial topics such as religion and politics with associates while working, and\nNEVER make personal remarks to or about any customer (or employee.) This may cause immediate termination. 1. **Building Relationships:** Make it personal by addressing customers by their name, if you know it. Help us build\nrelationships. ##### Last-Minute Shoppers\nTreat last-minute shoppers with courtesy and respect. Never rush a customer. The customer who comes in 10 minutes\nbefore closing time or 5 minutes after you started your shift deserves the same respect and courtesy as the customer\nwho shops during the middle of the day. Never make unkind remarks to the other store associates about \u201clast-minute shoppers.\u201d Inappropriate comments could\nresult in disciplinary action. ##### Tips\nWe advertise that our store is a total service market and that all services is free. You are not permitted to solicit tips. ##### Know Your Store\n\nKnow your store layout. You should be knowledgeable of our products, their location, and our services. Do not guess,\nand avoid making promises that Holiday Market won\u2019t be able to keep. If you do not know an answer, then tell the\ncustomer you will find an answer right away. ##### Advertising Guarantee\n\nWe will issue a rain check or substitute an item of equal value to any customer who wants to purchase an advertised\nspecial in which the current stock is sold out prior to the end of the sale. Please see a store manager or store owner for\ndetails. ---\n\n##### Customer Returns\nCustomer returns must be handled by the manager of the department where the product originated.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0005", "char_span": [25901, 30938], "sentence_count": 47, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0004", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0006", "keywords": ["customer", "customers", "store", "when", "that"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "91cf3d4743624f73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.155951", "token_count": 1018}}
{"text": "Please see a store manager or store owner for\ndetails. ---\n\n##### Customer Returns\nCustomer returns must be handled by the manager of the department where the product originated. For example, a\ncake return should be handled by the Bakery Manager. If the department manager is not available, call the Store\nManager to authorize the return. Never Argue with a customer. Treat them graciously until the manager takes over. ##### Customer Complaints\nRegardless of the type of complaint brought to you - **LISTEN!** Do not interrupt the customer. Be understanding. Thank them for bringing the matter to your attention and apologize for any inconvenience. Explain to the customer\nthat the Store Manager, or Department Manager will be happy to help them. Create an atmosphere of helpfulness. Show your gratitude for the chance to correct a mistake. When you do so, the\ncustomer will leave feeling satisfied. ##### Service Policy\nAll of our customers are to receive the same efficient, friendly, courteous service, regardless of race, color, religion,\nage, gender, disability, height, weight, marital status, physical appearance or any other characteristic. Do not hesitate\nto help a customer in need. Remember, our fellow associates are also customer. Treat them with the same courtesy you would a non-associate. ##### Customer Accidents\nAccidents demand immediate action. In all cases, alert the Department Manager or Store Manager at once, regardless\nof whether you think medical attention is required. Give all possible assistance to the customer. Under no\ncircumstances are you to make any promise or statement that would obligate you or this company for payment of\nmedical expenses or damage. It is very important that you never make a statement acknowledging responsibility. If a\ncustomer\u2019s clothing is soiled, torn or otherwise damaged, do not take it upon yourself to promise payment. In an\nemergency, stay with them until it is resolved or until you are excused from the scene. ##### Breakage of Merchandise in the Store or Parking Lot\nIf a customer breaks an item, approach the customer and put them at ease by saying \u201cNot to worry, accidents happen.\u201d\nTell the customer they should continue to shop, and you will take care of the damaged merchandise. It is very\nimportant that the customer is not made to feel guilty. Accidents tend to happen. Begin the clean-up, but call\nmaintenance to help/finish up with the clean-up. ##### Store Cleanliness\nA clean store attracts and retains customers. All of us need to help keep our store clean. Please try to be aware of any\npapers or debris in the aisle or parking lot, and take a few extra seconds to pick them up and discard or put back in the\nproper location. The cleanliness of a store is a direct reflection of its associates. ##### Donations\nRefer any customer asking for donations or discounts to a store owner or store manager. Associates are prohibited\nfrom authorizing such transactions. ---\n\n##### Weights and Measures\n\nTrue weight, measures and counts are to be provided to all customers at all times. This means 16 ounces in a pound, to a dozen, with no variations one way or another. Anything less is not good enough for our valued customers. Never do anything in a manner that would indicate carelessness when using the scales. Tare weight, is the weight of an\nempty container/bag before the product is placed in it. Always adjust the tare weight before setting the price on the\nscales, and be sure to keep your hands away from the scales while they are \u201csettling down\u201d and recording. ##### Sales to Minors - Illegal Transactions\n\nCertain products require verification of age prior to making a sale. You are responsible for verifying the age of anyone\nwho appears under 35 years old for these items. If they are of improper age, then it is illegal to make the sale. If you\nmake the improper transaction, then you are subject to discipline, up to and including immediate discharge. You also\nput yourself at risk of personal liability, including fines and jail time. It is also illegal to sell to a minor if they have a note from a parent or guardian authorizing the minor to make the\npurchase. Specific age restrictions appear below. Contact your store director should you have any questions. ---\n\n##### Dress Code\n\nWe want our customers to notice you - not your clothes. Your clothing and attire should be clean and without holes. If\nyou have any doubt whether your choice of dress will be acceptable, get your manager\u2019s approval before wearing the\nitem to work.

If you see anyone hiding merchandise in their clothing or in a packaging they are carrying, then quietly\nreport the incident to management. Try to do so without losing sight of the person involved. We want to be sure that\nperson does not dispose of the merchandise. When the manager arrives, state what the item is and where it was hidden. The manager will evaluate the situation. ---\n\n##### Store Robberies\n\n1. Obey the robber: Should a holdup occur, obey all orders given by the robber. Do not argue or hesitate.

Machines must not be operated until all\nguards are in place. Do not bypass or remove guards, unless for maintenance, cleaning or repair purposes. Safety\nlaws require power lockout procedures to prevent the unexpected startup of power equipment while cleaning or\nservicing machines.

The company may require an employee to\nprovide a doctor\u2019s certification of serious health condition. If an employee takes a leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition or develops a condition that\nis a serious health condition, the company may designate all or some portion of related sick leave taken as leave under\nthis policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications. Except in the case of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness, an eligible employee\ncan take up to 12 weeks of leave under this policy during any 12-month period. The company will measure the 12month period by a \u201crolling\u201d 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee used any FMLA leave as\nprovided by the FMLA in its regulations. A husband and wife who are eligible for leave under this policy and are employed by the same covered employer are\npermitted to take only a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken:\n\n--- For the birth of a child/to care for the child after birth\n--- For placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement\n--- To care for the employee\u2019s parent with a serious health condition.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0016", "char_span": [76288, 81249], "sentence_count": 34, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0015", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0017", "keywords": ["care", "health", "leave", "condition", "period"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "REST", "SICK LEAVE"], "hash_64": "39c799474b376673", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.202217", "token_count": 1026}}
{"text": "Each time an employee takes leave the company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this\npolicy and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is\nentitled to take at that time. Eligible employees can take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered\nservice member with a serious injury or illness. A single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of leave entitlement\ndescribed in this paragraph occurs using the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee\u2019s first\nFMLA leave to care for the covered service member begins. ---\n\n##### Employee Status & Benefits During Leave\nWhile an employee is on leave, the company will continue the employee\u2019s health benefits. If the employee chooses not to return to work for reasons other than a continued serious health condition or reasons\nbeyond the employee\u2019s control, Holiday Market will require the employee to reimburse the company the amount paid\nfor health insurance while the employee was on leave. Under current company policy, employees must make a\npremium payment (their weekly payment) to Holiday Market at the same time as a payment that would be made if it\nwas a normal payroll deduction. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee\u2019s health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of\nleave. In the event that a payment is not received, the company will mail a notice of late payment to the employee days before the date that coverage would be dropped, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specific date at least\n15 days after the date of the letter. If the employee contributes to any other type of insurance/disability plan, the employer will continue to make payroll\ndeductions while the employee is on paid leave. While the employee is on unpaid leave, they must continue to make\nthose payments in the same manner prescribed in the paragraph above, along with health care payments. If the\nemployee does not continue these payments, the company may cancel coverage during the leave period, or will\nrecover the payments at the end of the leave period, in a manner consistent with the law. ##### Employee Status After Leave\n\nAn employee who takes leave under this policy will be able to return to the same position when leave commenced, or\nto an equivalent position as provided by the FMLA and its regulations. The equivalent position will have the same pay,\nbenefits, and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites, and status. Under certain circumstances the company may deny the employee to come back if:\n\n1. The employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested. 1. The employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee\u2019s inability to attend a necessarycourse or renew a license as a result of the leave, despite being given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill those\nconditions upon return to work. 1. The employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the job due to a physical or mental condition,including the continuation of a serious health condition with or without a reasonable accommodation. 1. The employee is a \u201ckey employee\u201d and the restoration of the employee would result in substantial and grievouseconomic injury to the company. The term \u201ckey employee\u201d refers to any salary eligible employee who is\namong the highest paid 10% of all employees within 75 miles. ##### Paid Leave\n\nIf the employee has accrued paid leave (Vacation, Sick, Personal,) that accrued paid leave will be substituted against\npart or all of the approved 12-week FMLA. The employee may elect to retain a bank of up to 80 hours of accrued\nleave. Leave taken under the company\u2019s long-term disability plan or workers compensation plan is considered paid\nsick leave for purposes of FMLA. ---\n\n##### Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule\n\nThe employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day\nperiodically when needed over a year,) or under certain circumstances may use the leave to reduce the work week or\nwork day, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 weeks over a 12month period. Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatments so as not to disrupt\nthe employer\u2019s operations. The company may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and\nbenefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule. For the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, the company and the employee must mutually agree to the schedule\nbefore the employee may take the leave intermittently or work a reduced hour schedule. Leave for the birth, adoption,\nor foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the birth or placement of the child. The company may require certification of the medical necessity.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0017", "char_span": [81249, 86254], "sentence_count": 32, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0016", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0018", "keywords": ["employee", "leave", "company", "will", "paid"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "REST", "SICK LEAVE"], "hash_64": "3bcbec4767236273", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.206837", "token_count": 1004}}
{"text": "Leave for the birth, adoption,\nor foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the birth or placement of the child. The company may require certification of the medical necessity. ##### Certification of the Serious Health Condition\n\nThe company may ask for you to provide certification of the serious health condition within 5 business days after the\nrequest is made in the case of foreseeable leaves and within 5 business days after the leave commences in the case of\nunforeseeable leaves. The employees should try to respond within 15 days of the request, or provide a reasonable\nexplanation for the delay. Failure to provide certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical\nCertification should be provided by using the Medical Certification Form that is available in the HR department. Certification of the serious health condition shall include: The date when the condition began, its expected duration,\ndiagnosis, and a brief statement of treatment. For medical leave for the employee\u2019s own medical condition, the\ncertification must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform work of any kind or a statement that\nthe employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the employee\u2019s position. For a seriously ill family\nmember, the certification must include a statement that the patient requires assistance and that the employee\u2019s presence\nwould be beneficial or desirable. The company has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to doubt the certification the company will pay\nfor the employee to get a certification from a second doctor, whom the company will select and who is not a company\nemployee. The company will also reimburse the employee or family member for any reasonable \u201cout of pocket\u201d travel\nexpenses incurred to obtain the second and third medical opinions. If necessary, to resolve a conflict between the original certification and the second opinion, Holiday Market will\nrequire the opinion of a third doctor. Holiday Market and the employee will jointly select the third doctor, and Holiday\nMarket will pay for the opinion. The third opinion will be considered final. ##### Procedure for Requesting Leave\n\nExcept where leave is not foreseeable, all employees requesting leave under this policy should submit the request in\nwriting to their immediate manager as soon as practicable and within the time prescribed by Holiday Market usual and\ncustomary notice requirements applicable such leave, and include a basis for the FMLA leave. ---\n\nWhen an employee plans to take leave under this policy, the employee must give the company 30 days\u2019 notice. If it is\nnot possible as is practicable. An employee undergoing planned medical treatment is required to make a reasonable\neffort to schedule the treatment to minimize disruptions to the company\u2019s operations. While on leave, employees are requested to report either very 2 weeks or every 30 days to the company, regarding the\nstatus of the medical condition, and their intent to return to work. If the employee does not return at the end of the\nleave period, the employee\u2019s notification of his/her intent not to return will be the COBRA qualifying event. The company may request recertification as provided in the FMLA regulations. ##### Military Caregiver Leave\nHoliday Market permits a spouse, son/daughter, parent or next related to take up to 26 weeks of leave during a 12month period to care for a covered service member who suffers from a serious injury/illness incurred on active duty. A covered service member is a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard, or Reserves,\nwho is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the\ntemporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. ##### Qualifying Urgent Matters\n\nAn employee may take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave for a \u201cqualifying urgent matter\u201d arises when a souse, a parent or\nchild is currently on or has been called to active duty. Qualifying Urgent Matter leave may be taken for the following\nreasons:\n\nShort Notice Deployment: Occurs when notice of the call for deployment is received within 7 days of the deployment. Leave can occur for any purpose and is limited to seven calendar days beginning on the date of a covered military member\nis notified of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation. Military Events: To attend a ceremony, program, or event sponsored by the military that is related to the active duty or call\nto active duty of a covered service member, and to attend family support or assistance programs and informational briefings\nsponsored or promoted by the military, military service organizations, or the American Red Cross that are related to the\nactive duty or callup.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md", "company": "Holiday Market", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Holiday Market", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0018", "char_span": [86254, 91101], "sentence_count": 27, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0017", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Holiday_Market.md_chunk_0019", "keywords": ["leave", "certification", "employee", "company", "medical"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "FMLA"], "hash_64": "39c9c84767236671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.212349", "token_count": 955}}
{"text": "Childcare and School Activities: To arrange for alternative childcare for a child of a covered servicemember, provide\nchildcare on an urgent, immediate need basis (but not on a routine), to enroll or transfer the service member\u2019s child to a new\nschool or day care facility, and to attend meetings at a school or daycare regarding parent-teacher conferences, disciplinary\nmatters or counseling for the service member\u2019s child. Financial and Legal Arrangements: To make or update financial or legal arrangements to address the service member\u2019s\nabsence, such as the preparation of wills or execution of powers of attorney. Counseling: To attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for the employee, the covered\nservice member or their child arising from the call-up to active duty. Rest and Recuperation: To spend time with a servicemember who is on short-term rest and recuperation leave during a\nperiod of deployment. These leaves are limited to 5 days for each instance of rest and recuperation. ---\n\nPost-Deployment Activities: To attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events and other programs sponsored\nby the military within 90 days following the end of the deployment and to address issues that arise from the death of a\nservice member. Additional Activities: To address other events that arise out of the above duty or call-up provided the employer and\nemployee agree that such leave shall qualify as an Urgent Matter, and agree to both the timing and duration of leave. Qualifying Urgent Matter Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. Holiday Market will seek\ncertification of Qualifying Urgent matter Leave the first time an employee requests such leave. Holiday Market will require\nemployees to provide a copy of active-duty orders or other documentation issued by the military indicating that the covered\nmilitary member is on or called to active duty and the dates of service. Additionally, Form WH-384 must be completed in\nconnection with Qualifying Urgent Matter leaves. ##### Military Leave\n\nThe companies will comply with the Uniform Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. S 4301 et seq. pertaining to military leave. As the laws change, or as interpretations of the laws change, military leave\nbenefits for companies\u2019 employees may change accordingly. No attempt is made in this policy to cover all possible\nsituations and circumstances that may arise when an employee is ordered to active duty. Therefore, as military leave\nsituations arise, employees should consult with their manager for current and complete details regarding their military leave\nrights as a company employee and should make sure the Benefits Office is contacted regarding any continuation of benefits. ---\n\nPension Benefits: Time spent on military leave (paid or unpaid) is not considered a break in employment for pension\nbenefit purposes. The returning service member who is eligible for reinstatement under USERRA has up to 3 times the\nlength of military leave (up to a max of 5 years) to make the retirement contribution payments he or she would have\nmade to establish retirement credit. USERRA does not permit double credit in two retirement systems for the same\nmilitary leave. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to purchase credit in company if he/she receives credit in any\nother public retirement system, except federal social security system. Re-Employment Rights: USERRA places a 5-year limit (with some exceptions) on the cumulative length of time a\nperson may voluntarily serve in the military and remain eligible for re-employment rights. The USERRA\nreinstatements rights do not extend, however, to employees who are employed for brief, non-recurrent periods with no\nreasonable expectation that employment will continue indefinitely. Under certain circumstances employees that are\neligible to be reinstated to their former position unless company establishes that the circumstances have so changed as\nto make re-employment impossible or unreasonable. If on military leave for 90 days or less, eligible employees may\nbe reinstated to their own position or a similar position of like seniority, status or pay. Upon return from military leave,\nemployees must comply with the current provisions of the law in regards to notification of and time frame in which\nthey must return to work. These limits are specified in 38 USC S4312 and vary depending on the length of service. ---\n\nAn individual who receives the extended coverage period due to a disability must notify the plan administrator when it\nis determined that the individual is no longer disabled within the definitions of the social security ace. The law also states that your continuation coverage (18, 29, 36 months) may be cut short for any of the below reasons:\n\n1. If the company no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees\n2. If the premium for your continuation coverage is not paid\n3.

Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the work schedule and to report ready to\nwork, on time. Changes to the schedule may be necessary from time to time. Although an employee is not\nrequired to come in on their day off, your cooperation is appreciated. Working as a team means\nthat you will cover for a sick employee, knowing that perhaps the situation will be reversed in\nthe future and that employee will cover for you. If personal circumstances require it, you may request a schedule change. It is your responsibility\nto arrange a fill-in for the shift(s) you will miss. The replacement must be from the same\ndepartment and requires at least 24-hour advance notice to your department head. Management\nhas the right to refuse such a change if it causes the replacement to qualify for overtime or\notherwise creates a hardship to the replacement or the department operation.

Overtime\nwill be paid at the rate of time and a half for hours exceeding 40 between Sunday at 12:01 a.m. and Saturday at 12:00 midnight. Overtime hours will be paid for only once. In no case will there be any pyramiding of overtime\nhours. Vacation time will not be considered as time worked for overtime purposes. ###### Absenteeism/Tardiness\nThe successful operation of the Hotel depends upon every team member being at work and on\ntime. Employees must notify their department head of an intended absence as soon as is known,\nbut in any event at least four hours before their scheduled starting time. This procedure must be\nfollowed for each day of absence. Failure to notify management of an expected absence may be\nconsidered a no-call, no-show situation and will result in a warning notice and counseling on\nattendance for the employee. If an employee doesn't show up for three shifts in a row, without\nnotification to management of any kind, it will be determined that they have quit their job. In\naddition, failure to report to work for three days (consecutive or otherwise) during any three\nconsecutive months, without authorization, may result in discharge without prior warning. ---\n\nIf an employee misses three or more consecutive days because of illness, a written notification\nfrom a physician describing the reason for the illness and absence may be required. This\nnotification must be submitted before the employee is allowed to return to work to ensure the\nemployee's health is adequate to perform work duties. If an employee is going to be late for a shift, it is their responsibility to call his/her department\nhead or supervisor as soon as is known, but in any event at least two hours before the scheduled\nstarting time. The employee must specify the time he/she may be expected to arrive for work. In\nsuch event, the manager may decide to cancel the employee's shift, at his/her discretion.

Travelers should verify that planned travel is\neligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements.

Hotel employees are expected to be neat, clean and well groomed while on\nthe job. Clothing must be appropriate to the type of work being performed. Uniforms will be provided to those employees who are required to wear a uniform in the course\nof their duties. Employees in positions that require a uniform are expected to be in proper\nuniform anytime they are working. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to keep the uniform in\ngood repair and to prevent its loss or destruction beyond ordinary wear and tear. Uniforms must\nbe clean and well pressed at all times. If a uniform is lost, stolen, destroyed, or rendered\nunusable, the employee will be charged the full cost for its replacement.

Management reserves the right to determine appropriateness. Any employee who is\n\n---\n\nimproperly dressed will be counseled or in severe cases may be sent home to change clothes. Continued disregard of this policy may be cause for disciplinary action, which may result in\ntermination. ###### SAFETY and SECURITY\n\n###### Safety Standards\nAccident prevention is one of the most vital concerns, in fact, safety is a prerequisite to\ncontinued employment. It is the intent of management to afford you a safe and productive place\nin which to work. Toward this end, all employees are expected to be familiar with and to follow\nbasic rules of safety. Accidents are usually caused by carelessness or neglect on the part of individuals. Fatigue and a\nrush to complete any given task also contribute to accidents. Be aware of any tendencies in\nthese regards and remember that safety is the priority. We also advise every employee to take\nnote of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of\nyour training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct\nany unsafe condition or practice.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0006", "char_span": [29374, 34383], "sentence_count": 42, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0005", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0007", "keywords": ["employees", "must", "that", "this", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "39cd09474f33ca73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.084351", "token_count": 1004}}
{"text": "We also advise every employee to take\nnote of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of\nyour training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct\nany unsafe condition or practice. You are to report to your supervisor immediately any situation\nwhich appears unsafe to you and that you cannot correct yourself. \"Safety consciousness\" are key words each of us must remember at all times. Employees with\npoor safety records are a hazard to all of us, and are subject to dismissal. While most safety\nprecautions are simply a matter of common sense and good housekeeping, we have developed a\nsafety notebook which is available in your department. It is your responsibility to read the\nnotebook and become familiar with proper safety procedures. ###### Use of Equipment\nEmployees are not to work with any equipment or machinery which they have not been properly\ntrained on. ###### Material Safety Data Sheets (M.S.D.S.)\nFor your protection, M.S.D.S. sheets are available for your review. Your department head will\nshow you were they are located. All employees should be familiar with the chemicals, cleaning\nagents, etc., that are used in the course of their job duties. For additional information, contact\nyour department head or GM. ###### Company Property\nAny packages or company property leaving the premises must be cleared through your\ndepartment head, supervisor or manager on duty.

It is everyone's responsibility to take precautions in order to\nprevent theft and to ensure the safety of our guests and fellow employees. There are many ways\nto make this property a safer place:\n\n- Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable,\ndo not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the\nperson if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say\nsomething like, \"Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need\nhelp, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), \"Are you a guest\nhere?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a\nlegitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better\nto err on the side of caution. - Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. - Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. - Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting\ninformation about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General\nManager. - Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may\noffer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor. - Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or\ndepartment. - Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,\nthey should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel\nemployee. If no answer, they should then crack the door open slightly and repeat their\nidentification. - Under no circumstances are any hotel keys to leave the property. - Use of the guest rooms for personal use is strictly prohibited. ###### Fire Procedures\nA Fire Procedures Notebook is available in your department. It contains information as to how to\nrespond in case of a fire. It is your responsibility to read the notebook and to become familiar\nwith the procedures to be followed.

Each employee is responsible to ensure that the premises are safe for both\nemployees and guests. ---\n\nIf an employee becomes aware of any actual violence, imminent violence, or threat of imminent\nviolence, obtaining emergency assistance must be a matter of first priority. The employee should\nimmediately contact local law enforcement authorities by dialing 911. Immediately after\ncontacting the law enforcement authorities for emergency assistance, the employee must report\nthe incident to the General Manager or Company President immediately. Employees may report\nany incidents of violence or threats of violence without fear of reprisal or any kind. Employees who become aware of any threats of workplace violence must report the threats\nimmediately to the GM or President who will consult with the appropriate resources in order to\ncomplete an assessment of the incident and the surrounding circumstances.

On-call employees are not eligible for benefits. ###### Background and Reference Checks\nTo ensure that individuals who join our Hotel are well qualified and to ensure that the Alta Hotel\nmaintains a safe and productive work environment, the Hotel will conduct pre-employment\nbackground checks on applicants who accept an offer of employment. Background checks may\ninclude verification of any information on the applicant\u2019s resume or application form. To the\nextent legally allowed at the time, the hotel may also use information available on social media\nsites in its hiring decisions. The Hotel also reserves the right to conduct a background check for current employees to\ndetermine eligibility for promotion or reassignment in the same manner as described above. ###### Personnel Records\nIt is particularly important that employees keep the hotel informed about changes in their:\n\n- Address\n- Telephone number\n- Marital status\n- Number of dependents\n- Legal name (through marriage or otherwise)\n- Name of person to be notified in case of an emergency\nReport any such changes, in writing, to the General Manager or the Director of Human\nResources. Employee files are kept confidential, and may not be viewed without proper authorization from\nthe GM. Information in an employee file may never be used for any reason other than legitimate\nhotel purposes. Violation of these policies is subject to discipline up to and including\ntermination. Any department head considering the hire of a former employee or transfer of a\ncurrent employee may be granted access to that employee\u2019s file. Employees are entitled to\nreview their file. Although the file cannot leave the office in which it is kept, your General\nManager can make arrangements for you to review the file. ###### Introductory Period\nThe first 60 days of employment is an introductory period; during which time employees will be\nevaluated carefully to determine their suitability for their position. An employee who fails to\nperform satisfactorily during this time may be terminated without notice. In some situations, the employee may receive a training wage during their introductory period. ###### Performance Reviews\nPeriodically, written performance reviews will be given by your department head. A\nperformance review will normally be given at least once a year and will be placed in your\npersonnel file. Performance reviews do not always result in a pay increase. ---\n\n###### Discipline\nEvery employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by existing rules\nand policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/her duties to the best of\nhis/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her job description or as otherwise\nestablished. When policies and procedures are not being followed, it is the responsibility of your department\nhead or the general manager to correct the situation. This will take the form of\ncoaching/counseling; or more formal verbal and/or written warnings. The Hotel reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending on the facts of\neach situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching,\ncounseling and/or training; the employee's work record; and the impact the conduct and\nperformance issues have on our organization. Initially, when an employee displays unacceptable behavior or his/her performance is not\nmeeting the job requirements, the employee will be made aware of the situation and be given an\nopportunity to correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time. In some cases, this initial\ncontact may include a verbal warning. A verbal warning will occur if previous coaching has not corrected the problem or if the initial\nissue is sufficiently serious. The warning will be noted in the employee's personnel records. A written warning is given when your department head or the general manager believes that an\noffense is sufficiently serious or when a verbal warning has proven insufficient. The written\nwarning may also include a notation indicating that the next similar transgression will result in\ntermination. You should recognize the grave nature of the written warning. If you feel the\nwarning is inaccurate or unwarranted, you may respond, in writing, and your response will be\nattached to the written warning and placed in your personnel file. An employee may be terminated if he/she has three written warnings, for any reason, in their file. For problems deemed to be serious enough, or for failure to respond appropriately to prior\ncounseling and warnings, suspension and/or termination may occur. If suspended, the employee\nwill be expected to leave the premises immediately and remain off work, without pay, for the\nduration of their suspension. If an employee is terminated, they will be expected to leave the premises immediately. A final\npaycheck will be issued the same day (or the next business day if termination happens on a\nweekend).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0009", "char_span": [44841, 50123], "sentence_count": 42, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0008", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0010", "keywords": ["will", "employee", "employees", "hotel", "that"], "policy_tags": ["WARN"], "hash_64": "39cdad4767236e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.097814", "token_count": 1020}}

Failure to return some items may result\nin deductions from the final paycheck. An employee will be required to sign the Wage Deduction\nAuthorization Agreement to deduct the costs of such items from the final paycheck. ---\n\n###### Rehire\nFormer employees who left the Hotel in good standing and were classified as eligible for rehire\nmay be considered for reemployment. An applicant or employee who is terminated for violating policy or who resigned in lieu of\ntermination from employment due to a policy violation will be ineligible for rehire. ###### Problem Solving Procedures\nIf you would like to discuss any aspect of your employment, work conditions, interactions with\nother staff members, or company policy we urge you to bring your concerns to our attention. Discuss the matter with your department head. During this discussion feel free to share your\nconcerns. Generally, you and your department head should be able to resolve your problems.

{"text": "A \u201cSpeak Out\u201d form is available in this manual for this purpose. ###### GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES\n\n###### Employee Conduct\nEmployees are expected to treat our guests, customers, and one another with respect and\nunderstanding. Any rudeness (e.g., profanity, yelling, use of vulgar or obscene language, suggestive or sarcastic\ngestures) will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination. Do not talk about company issues in public areas and by no means discuss any\ngrievances with guests. ###### Dating/Marriage Policy\nDating or marriage to a coworker in today's business, legal and social environment has an impact\nbeyond the otherwise simple relationship between two people. Among the various factors\ncomplicating matters, the following three \"risks\" are readily apparent. Risk to the business, reflected in three main areas:\n\n1. Financial defalcation\n2. Inappropriate influence over decision making Judgment\n\n---\n\n1. Compromising operational policies/procedures\n2. Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism. 3. Risk of sexual harassment suits. As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the\nworkplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to\nprotect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the\nintent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,\nthereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management. This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):\n\n1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:\na. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 1. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the\nconnection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential\nconflict of interest by compromising any of the following:\n\na. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to\ncommunicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject\nthat responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral\nreassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for\nthe purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to\nprudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior\" positions. There is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In\nthat event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel. ###### Guest Privacy\nEmployees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on\npremise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out. An\nemployee is in a position to observe the personal actions of many people. It is mandatory that\nyou never discuss your observations either within or outside the property. However, should you\nnotice anything detrimental to the property or its guests, notify your department head, the\nGeneral Manager immediately. Keep in mind that all guest services (pool, fitness center, lobby, van, etc.) are for guest use only,\nunless otherwise allowed by the GM\n\n---\n\nUnder no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation\nunless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. ###### Leaving Property during Work Hours\nIt is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to\nconduct personal business.

We are better able to understand and meet\nthe changing needs of the communities and clients we serve by reflecting their diverse make-up. For us, an inclusive culture is a work environment that welcomes and embraces the strengths of our differences,\nsupports involvement, and provides everyone with equal access to opportunities and information.

If you wish to review the Program or have any other questions or concerns regarding this\npolicy, please contact HR Shared Services. ##### Business Ethics and Conduct\n\nOld National is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our team members. The Company\u2019s\nreputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and\nregulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity. The continued success of Old National is dependent upon our customers\u2019 trust, and we are dedicated to preserving\nthat trust. Team members have a duty to Old National Bancorp, its customers, and shareholders to act in a way that\nwill merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Old National expects its directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit,\nand intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment based on high ethical principles will guide you with respect to acceptable\nconduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter should be\ndiscussed openly with your immediate supervisor and, if necessary, with a Human Resources Representative for\nadvice and consultation. Maintaining the highest level of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every Old National team member. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment. #### \u00bb **Annually, team members will be required to reaffirm their commitment to these standards**\n\n[**by acknowledging and accepting our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.**](https://www.oldnational.com/docs/default-source/noindex/associate-website/handbook/code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics-2020.pdf?Status=Temp&sfvrsn=3f5ac8fa_2)\n\nAcknowledgment and acceptance of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a condition of continued employment\nwith Old National Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Individuals who fail to acknowledge and accept the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics will be subject to termination of employment. ##### Compensation Administration\n\nOld National Bancorp recognizes that to attract, motivate and retain a highly skilled workforce, team members must be\ncompensated in a fair and equitable manner. The Company believes that all jobs are important to the success and\ngrowth of the organization. Therefore, a compensation philosophy has been adopted that ensures all team members a\ncompetitive compensation package based upon the type of work they do and how well they do it. This philosophy enables Old National to provide its entire workforce, from non-exempt team members to executive\nofficers, with competitive base pay and opportunities for additional financial rewards based on performance that\nmeets or exceeds established objectives. ---\n\n##### Job Documentation and Evaluation\n\nJob Documentation and Evaluation is the systematic process for obtaining important and relevant information about\neach distinct role in the organization. The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of\nevery job. These include:\n\n**Essential Duties and Responsibilities**\n\n- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities\n\n- Dimensional Data\n\n- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities\n\n- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job\nresponsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to\nidentify the appropriate career level for the position. ##### Pay Ranges\n\nEach career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range\nminimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and\nperformance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job\u2019s pay range. The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the\nquality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member\u2019s pay closer\nto the midpoint of the job\u2019s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of\nthe preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career\nlevels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [20532, 25900], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["team", "conduct", "business", "national", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "388fb9464d676671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.872280", "token_count": 1015}}

We recognize our team\nmembers have a broad range of personal and community interests and involvement and we strive to find the right\nbalance between supporting those pursuits and protecting the reputation, brand, and financial success of the\nCompany. In some cases, the mere potential for conflict or the appearance of a conflict can be a problem, therefore,\nteam members should avoid situations which affect their ability to be objective and impartial or their loyalties may\nbecome divided. Old National recognizes not all conflicts of interest present a problem, and the Company seeks to\nidentify and manage all actual and potential conflicts of interest with integrity and transparency.

Generally, discrimination against persons with a known association or\nrelationship with a disabled individual is prohibited. Old National provides reasonable accommodations in order for the\nindividual to perform the essential functions of the job in question. Old National does not retaliate against individuals\nbecause they request a reasonable accommodation. While many individuals with disabilities can work without accommodation, some individuals may face barriers to\nemployment in the absence of an accommodation process. If Old National is notified that a qualified individual with\na disability requires a reasonable accommodation in order to apply for a position, perform the essential functions\nof a job, or enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, the Company will work with the individual to find a\nreasonable accommodation unless doing so would impose a direct threat to the team member, applicant, or others\nand without imposing an undue hardship on Old National\u2019s business. Initial requests for reasonable accommodation may be presented verbally or in writing to a Human Resources\nRepresentative or your supervisor. An individual seeking an accommodation will engage in an interactive dialog,\n\u201cthe interactive process\u201d with their supervisor and/or a Human Resources Representative. Old National\u2019s Human\nResources Department is responsible for determining if the individual is considered \u201cqualified\u201d and if a \u201creasonable\naccommodation\u201d exists. The reasonable accommodation is not required to be the specific accommodation requested\nby the individual. There may be more than one way to reasonably accommodate the individual. It is also possible that\nthe only reasonable accommodation is a leave of absence. Old National is not required to change the essential\nfunctions of the job as a reasonable accommodation. Assistance will be made available to any individual requiring\nhelp in identifying an appropriate accommodation. Supporting documentation of the disability and/or accommodation\nmay be requested.

Other recruiting sources\nmay also be used to fill open positions. There are situations where management may choose not to post a job such as\nopenings resulting from restructuring, reorganization or staff reductions or an opportunity to promote a current team\nmember. Most job openings will be posted on the Company\u2019s Intranet site.

Volunteer time does not carry forward and any unused*\n*volunteer time will not be paid at termination.*\n\nSubject to state workers\u2019 compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the\npayment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member\u2019s voluntary participation in\nany off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during\nnormal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program. ##### Work Schedules\n\nWork schedules for team members vary throughout our organization. Staffing needs and operational demands may\nnecessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each\nday and week. Old National may need to occasionally increase or decrease work schedules or hours for business reasons and team\nmembers will be asked to comply with such changes. However, these team members will be given as much advance\nnotice as possible. ---\n\n##### Alternative Work Schedules\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to create a fit between work schedules with the other responsibilities in our lives. Old National is a\nWork/Life company, and that means that we are committed to, whenever possible, working with our team members to\nachieve a fit that ensures that both work duties and other responsibilities are fulfilled. Alternative Work Schedules are a part of this commitment. Although not every position may be conducive to alternative\nwork arrangements, managers will review each situation individually to meet team member needs while maintaining\nadequate staffing levels and providing superior customer service. Alternative work arrangements include, but are not\nlimited to, compressed work weeks, part-time hours, job sharing, reduced and/or flex hours. While these options are\nnot an entitlement, when managers and team members work together, they can turn a challenge into a true win-win\nsituation. If you encounter a situation that leads you to believe that an Alternative Work Schedule would meet your needs, you\nshould carefully consider how it will impact your department and be prepared with possible solutions when you meet\nwith your manager to request the Alternative Work Schedule. More information regarding Alternative Work Schedules, including the request form can be found in MyHR. ##### Employment Categories\n\nEmployment categories are established so that team members will understand their employment status and benefit\neligibility. Each team member is assigned to either a Non-Exempt or Exempt category according to Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA) requirements. Non-Exempt team members are entitled to overtime pay. Exempt team members are excluded\nfrom state and/or federal overtime regulations. A team member\u2019s Exempt or Non-Exempt classification may be\nchanged to comply with the appropriate regulations. **In addition to the above categories, each team member will be assigned to one of the following classifications:**\n\n**FULL- TIME**\n\nThose team members who are not in a temporary status and who are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours\nper week. They are eligible for Old National Bancorp\u2019s benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and\nlimitations of each benefit plan. **PART- TIME**\n\nThose team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours per week. Part-time level I team\nmember is defined as a team member who is regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours every week. A part-time\nlevel II team member is defined as a team member who is scheduled to work less than 20 hours every week. **TEMPORARY**\n\n---\n\n##### Polygraph Tests\n\nOld National complies with The Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988. The Federal Employee Polygraph\nProtection Act prohibits most private sector employers from requiring or requesting team members or job applicants\nto take any lie detector tests or from using the results of such a test, even if an outside agency screens team members\nor applicants. Further, team members and applicants can\u2019t be discriminated against based on polygraph test results or\nfor refusing to take the test. Employers must also inform team members and applicants in writing of their rights under\nthis law. ##### Confidential Information\n\nThe protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and the continued success\nof Old National.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0009", "char_span": [47255, 52427], "sentence_count": 35, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0008", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0010", "keywords": ["team", "work", "members", "will", "hours"], "policy_tags": ["FLSA", "MEAL", "OVERTIME", "REST"], "hash_64": "bacd9d475b624e29", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.894332", "token_count": 995}}

Old National provides a variety of paid time off and leave benefits to meet team members\u2019\nneeds. This section explains the opportunities available to Old National team members. ##### Paid Time Off\n\nOld National offers team members access to a Paid Time Off (PTO) bank of time that provides flexibility to manage\npaid time away from work based on individualized needs and circumstances. Team members may use their PTO for\nany reason including vacations, illnesses, appointments, or other personal reasons. Any non-emergency absences\nand pre-planned usage of PTO must be approved in advance by your supervisor. Your supervisor will evaluate your\nPTO requests and determine whether to approve or deny it based on several factors, including business needs and\nstaffing requirements. At Old National, we support you in making the health of you and your loved ones a priority by providing you up to hours of paid time off per calendar year to use for medical appointments for yourself or an immediate family member\n(spouse/partner, child, parent, or another for whom you have legal guardianship). Paid time off provided for\nappointments may be used for medical, dental, vision, or other related appointments. **PAID TIME FOR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS IS:**\n\n- Provided in addition to the annual PTO bank of time provided to team members. - A benefit that should be used prior to using any annual PTO amounts for qualifying medical appointments. - Time you should coordinate with your management team in advance, when possible, to allow for properstaffing to meet business needs. - Not subject to carryover from one calendar year to the next\n\n- Not paid out upon separation of employment\n\nNon-exempt team members may report paid time for medical appointments using the DOC earnings code in our time\nreporting system. ---\n\nPTO is available to all team members based on the schedule below.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0014", "char_span": [72602, 77161], "sentence_count": 27, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0013", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0015", "keywords": ["time", "team", "paid", "members", "adoption"], "policy_tags": ["PTO"], "hash_64": "29c98b574b20626b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.915450", "token_count": 991}}

For those three noted exceptions, PTO paid at your separation\nfrom employment will be calculated based on the number of calendar months you have worked in the current plan year\nreduced by the PTO hours you have taken during the year. All accrued but unused PTO time for the current pay year\nwill be paid to those in the noted group exceptions at the rate of pay applicable at the time\nof termination of employment. Team members accrue 1/12 of their annual PTO allotment for any month in which\nthey work. Any remaining PTO carryover from the prior calendar year will be paid out in full upon separation of employment\nand will be paid at the rate of pay applicable at the time of termination of employment. ***Contact HR Shared Services if you have questions regarding PTO.***\n\n| NEW HIRE PTO SCHEDULE | | | |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| | | | |\n| Month of Hire | Non-Exempt | Exempt | Part-Time Level I |\n| | | | |\n| January | 136 Hours | 176 Hours | 48 Hours |\n| February | 124.75 Hours | 161.50 Hours | 44 Hours |\n| March | 113.50 Hours | 146.75 Hours | 40 Hours |\n| April | 102 Hours | 132 Hours | 36 Hours |\n| May | 90.75 Hours | 117.50 Hours | 32 Hours |\n| June | 79.50 Hours | 102.75 Hours | 28 Hours |\n| July | 68 Hours | 88 Hours | 24 Hours |\n| August | 56.75 Hours | 73.50 Hours | 20 Hours |\n| September | 45.50 Hours | 58.75 Hours | 16 Hours |\n| October | 34 Hours | 44 Hours | 12 Hours |\n| November | 22.75 Hours | 29.50 Hours | 8 Hours |\n| December | 11.5 Hours | 14.75 Hours | 4 Hours |\n\n---\n\n##### Bereavement Leave\n\nAt Old National, we recognize that team members may require time away from work following the death of a family\nmember.

Team members must provide the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so the supervisor can\nplan for their absence.

Commissions shall be averaged for the 24 months that are prior to the date the leave began. If employed less than months, the commissions shall be averaged for the total number of months employed. Any commission payments that\ncontinue after the leave begins cannot be considered as part of the basic monthly earnings.

Team members with approved intermittent absences will be paid using their paid time off (PTO). All available PTO\nmust be used prior to being unpaid. Exempt team members that exhaust their PTO should open a case in MyHR so\ntheir payroll can be adjusted accordingly. ##### Long-Term Disability\n\nOld National provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits to eligible full-time team members who are unable to work\nbecause of a long-term qualifying medical disability. If a disability lasts longer than 26 weeks, Short-Term Disability\nbenefits stop and Long-Term Disability benefits for eligible team members may begin.

Advance notice of military service is required, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it is\notherwise impossible or unreasonable. If a team member is called to service in the military, or must attend military training, and he/she earns less in the\nmilitary, Old National will pay the difference between their regular salary and the amount paid by the government for\nup to 18 months. Although we are not required by law to pay this difference, we are proud to do so as a way of\nshowing our support for our team members who serve our country in the uniformed services. If a team member has\nunused Paid Time Off (PTO) when the leave begins, and the team member will not return from leave prior to the new\ncalendar year, the team member has the option to be paid for any unused PTO when the leave begins or at the end\nof the year. The team member\ncan choose to roll over up to 80 hours of PTO. Upon the team member\u2019s return to work after deployment, PTO will\nbe granted based on the team member\u2019s years of service. | COMMISSION TYPE | BASIC MONTHLY EARNINGS INCLUDES: |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| | |\n| Base Plus Commission | Monthly rate of base pay plus the average of 24 months of commission payments |\n| Straight Commission | Average of 24 months of commission payment, draw payments are withheld during\nthe leave period |\n\n---\n\n**MILITARY EXIGENCY LEAVE**\n\nOld National provides paid military exigency leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember whose spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty, or are called to covered active-duty status,\nto take leave to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short\nnotice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities. Paid military exigency leave may also\nqualify for FMLA and/or state law protection. Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for\npay purposes. **MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE**\n\nOld National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (\u201cnearest blood\nrelative\u201d) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state\nlaw protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave\nplan design for pay purposes. ##### Personal Leave\n\nOld National provides leaves of absence without pay to eligible team members who wish to take time off from work\nduties to fulfill obligations other than qualifying FMLA events such as, visiting family in a foreign country, or a mission\ntrip. Additionally, team members that do not meet the service requirements for paid leave for their own medical\ncondition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave. All team members are eligible to request\npersonal leave.

{"text": "All team members are eligible to request\npersonal leave. One personal leave may be granted for a period of up to 30 consecutive calendar days every two years per supervisor\napproval. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single\nextension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be\nevaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the\nproposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)\nbefore going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it\nis available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot\nguarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. ##### Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance\n\nOld National provides a comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This\nprogram covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,\nsurgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers\u2019 compensation insurance\nprovides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses. ---\n\nSubject to state workers\u2019 compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the\npayment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member\u2019s voluntary participation in\nany off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during\nnormal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program. ## Your Pay\n\nUnderstanding the components of your pay is important to you. In this section, the details of how time is tracked,\nas well as information on deductions and overtime is discussed. ##### Deductions\n\nThe law requires that Old National make certain deductions from every team member\u2019s compensation. Among these\nare applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Old National must also deduct Social Security taxes on each\nteam member\u2019s earnings up to the Social Security \u201cwage base.\u201d Old National matches the amount of Social Security\ntaxes paid by each team member. Old National offers additional programs and benefits. Team members authorize deductions from their pay checks\nto cover the costs of participation in these programs. Forms to change certain deductions are available on the\nCompany\u2019s Intranet by navigating to HR & L&D > Forms. Sometimes involuntary deductions are taken by Old National, usually to pay off a debt or obligation, when required by\nfederal or state agencies. Team members are encouraged to maintain a satisfactory credit record to ensure that these\ndeductions are not required. Confidential credit counseling services are available through Old National\u2019s Employee\nAssistance Program and may be available through other Credit Counseling Agencies located in your local community. If you have questions concerning deductions made from your paycheck or how they were calculated, contact HR\nShared Services. ##### Overdrafts\n\nAs a team member of Old National, you are encouraged to maintain your banking relationship with us. Our expectation\nis that you will maintain your account in good status. Therefore, we encourage you to consider Overdraft Protection for\nyour checking account(s) to cover inadvertent overdrafts. To sign up for Overdraft Protection, please contact Client Care or visit your local banking center. If you choose not to\nenroll in Overdraft Protection, overdraft decisions will be made according to Overdraft Courtesy guidelines. Team\nmembers with accounts that are overdrawn or with overdrafts that exceed Overdraft Protection coverage will be\nreviewed as part of the Company\u2019s overall internal control procedures. Certain government regulations place overdraft restrictions on certain executive officers. These restrictions include the\namount an account can be overdrawn, the length of time an account can be overdrawn and prohibits the waiving of\noverdraft fees. The restrictions identified within the regulations supersede any internal policy regarding overdrafts for\nthose individuals governed by this regulation.

When possible, advance notification of these mandatory assignments will be provided. Overtime must always be\napproved in advance by the team member\u2019s supervisor. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as\npractical to all team members qualified to perform the required work.

{"text": "Overtime will be paid to non-exempt team members who work more than 40 hours during a week, which is defined as\nSunday through Saturday, at the rate of one and one-half times the team member\u2019s regular base rate. Overtime\ncompensation is paid to all non-exempt team members in accordance with federal and state, wage, and hour\nrestrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time off for holidays, PTO, or any leave of absence will\nnot be considered hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. Overtime must always be approved in advance by the team member\u2019s supervisor. However, if a non-exempt team\nmember does not obtain pre-approval, the time must still be treated as work time. If a team member continues to work\novertime without proper approval or fails to work requested overtime, it may result in disciplinary action. Holiday premium pay is applicable to full and part time non-exempt team members. You will be paid one and one-half\ntimes your regular hourly rate for all hours worked on holidays observed by your office, in addition to receiving your\nregular holiday pay. If you work on a holiday, input the hours worked into Old National\u2019s timekeeping system as normal\nin/out entries. ##### Pay Corrections\n\nOld National takes all reasonable steps to ensure that team members receive the correct amount of pay in each\npaycheck and that team members are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. If there is an error in the amount of pay, the team member should promptly notify HR Shared Services so that the\ndiscrepancy can be reviewed. If the Company identifies the error, the team member will be contacted immediately,\nand the appropriate adjustment will be made as quickly as possible. Payroll corrections will normally be made with\nthe next scheduled paycheck date immediately following the error. If a team member\u2019s paycheck has been lost in the mail and it has been more than five business days, please contact\nHR Shared Services for instructions. ##### Paydays\n\nAll team members are paid bi-weekly with each payroll period ending at the end of the team member\u2019s normal shift on\nSaturday. For hourly team members, each pay advice will include earnings for all work performed through the end of\nthe previous payroll week. For salaried team members, each pay advice includes earnings for all work performed\nthrough the end of the week for the current payroll period. The normal payday for all team members is Friday. The\nCompany allows two options for team members to receive their bi-weekly pay. *Team members may either elect direct\ndeposit into an Old National account or choose to be paid by check. ( **Excluding the Minnesota Region* ). All Old National team members are eligible for three FREE personal checking accounts. This benefit applies to\ntraditional personal checking accounts only, and the team member must be a single or joint owner of the account. ---\n\n##### Severance Pay\n\nOld National provides severance pay to eligible team members whose employment is terminated because of a job\nelimination. The purpose of severance pay is to minimize the financial hardship that might occur when team members\nexperience job loss through no fault of their own. Severance benefits and the eligibility requirements are detailed in the\n[**Severance Pay Summary Plan Description**](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)[.](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)\n\n##### Timekeeping\n\nIt is the responsibility of every non-exempt team member to accurately record time worked. Federal and state laws\nrequire Old National to keep an accurate record of time worked to calculate team member pay and benefits. Time\nworked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Non-exempt team members should accurately record their time worked daily. Non-exempt team members must\naccurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal\nperiod. They should also record the hours of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. Salaried nonexempt team members must accurately record any deviations to their standard schedule. Misrepresenting or falsifying timekeeping or recording time for another team member may result in disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment. It is the team member\u2019s responsibility to enter their time to certify the accuracy of all time recorded.

Instructions and policies related to timekeeping can be found in MyHR. ***Note: Intranet sites are only accessible from within the Old National Network.***\n\n##### Travel Time\n\nOrdinary travel from home to work is not counted as hours worked. Non-exempt team members required to travel out\nof town for business-related matters will be paid for all hours worked. Additionally, hours worked include time spent\ntraveling to or home from the out-of-town business location (e.g., in a car, in an airplane). Other time spent out of town\nfor business travel, such as time in hotel for overnight stays and meals, are not considered hours worked. ##### Advances\n\nOld National does not provide pay advances on earned or unearned wages to team members, prior to the team\nmember\u2019s scheduled payment date, unless otherwise stated in an existing employment agreement. ---\n\n##### Pay Transparency\n\nOld National will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against team members or applicants because they\nhave inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another team member or applicant. However,\nteam members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of\ntheir essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not\notherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or\ncharge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by\nthe employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor\u2019s legal duty to furnish information. ## Your Conduct\n\nTo ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members\nto follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this\nsection of the Team Member Handbook, you\u2019ll learn what\u2019s expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the\njob as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. ##### Absenteeism\n\nAs part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you\u2019re\nnot working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. **PLANNED ABSENCES**\n\nYou must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the\nestablished guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or\nbanking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. **UNPLANNED ABSENCES**\n\nUnscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from\nyour manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to\nsuffer. If you\u2019re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your\nnormal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. **EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM**\n\nOld National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your\nimmediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business\ninterruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a\nmember of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their\nemployment with Old National. ---\n\nManagers are responsible for monitoring attendance-related issues on a case-by-case basis and taking corrective\naction, if required. ***Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action.***\n\n##### Team Member Conduct and Behavior\n\nEach team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual\nrespect and trust.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0023", "char_span": [113716, 118710], "sentence_count": 27, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0022", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0024", "keywords": ["team", "your", "their", "members", "time"], "policy_tags": ["MEAL", "REST"], "hash_64": "29ed9d075f636e39", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.953952", "token_count": 987}}
{"text": "***Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action.***\n\n##### Team Member Conduct and Behavior\n\nEach team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual\nrespect and trust. Our interactions with others, whether with team members, clients, vendors, or people in the\ncommunities we serve will reflect Old National's values and the appreciation we have for each other's contribution and\nperspective. In the context of this handbook, it isn't possible to list all the forms of conduct that are considered\nunacceptable in the workplace. Instead, we expect team members to use good judgment and common sense in\nsustaining a civil and respectful work environment. The Company's values serve as a benchmark for what is\nacceptable and what is not, and the company maintains sole discretion in the decision as to what is inappropriate. An\nindividual's conduct is not acceptable solely because the person believes it to be. Nor may a team member excuse\ntheir conduct because this handbook doesn't specifically prohibit objectionable behavior. Old National expects that\nteam members recognize that inappropriate conduct, from acts of dishonesty to intimidating or belittling others, is not\nacceptable. Several sections of this Handbook, such as Confidential Information, Business Ethics and Conduct,\nConflicts of interest, Absenteeism, Sexual Harassment and Unlawful Harassment and more, speak to the standards of\nbehavior expected of all team members. Refer to relevant sections of the Handbook for more information on specific\ntopics or contact your manager or a Human Resource Representative for more information. Team members are expected to report to any Corporate Security Officer, a Talent team member, HR Shared Services,\ntheir manager, or use the PSAR/SAR process on the Old National Intranet Homepage, all known or suspected criminal\nactivities affecting the Corporation, its customers, or team members. Withholding information or knowledge of criminal\nactivity may be cause for prosecution. ***Team members may report any suspicious activity by calling the toll-free hotline 866-ETHICSP.***\n\nThis hotline may be used anonymously, if the team member wishes, and without fear of reprisal. **The following are examples of some of the infractions or conduct that may result in disciplinary action,**\n**up to and including termination of employment. This list is not exhaustive, and Old National expects all**\n**team members to exercise sound judgment and personal responsibility for their actions and behavior:**\n\n- Acts of dishonesty such as theft, fraud, embezzlement, check kiting operation, misuse of Company credit cards,or other financial crimes. - Falsification of company records. - Working under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. - Irresponsible, negligent, or improper handling of company assets including systems, email, confidentialinformation, etc. - Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or controlled substances in the workplace,while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment. - Engaging in violent acts or threatening conduct. ---\n\n- Failure to meet behavior and performance expectations and/or training expectations for your role. - Failure to cooperate in Company investigations of workplace misconduct. - Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct. - Sexual or other unlawful harassment. Employment with Old National is at the mutual consent of Old National and the team member, and either party may\nterminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. ##### Dress Guidelines\n\nCreating a positive first impression paves the way for establishing good relationships. Often the impression you create\nis influenced by the way you present yourself, including your attire. At Old National, we follow a \u201cdress for your day\u201d approach. This means appropriate dress can vary from business to\ncasual. What is appropriate for each team member on a given day should be dictated by their role and the interaction\nthey expect to have with customers, fellow team members and others outside Old National on that day. Please consider your daily schedule when choosing your attire. Even if your circumstances allow for casual clothing,\nplease remember that your attire is a reflection on you and on Old National. ##### Drug and Alcohol Use\n\nIt is Old National\u2019s desire to provide a drug-free, healthy, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, team members\nare required to report to work in an appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory\nmanner.

Failure to\nsubmit to drug testing and participation in the Employee Assistance Program may be grounds for termination. Team members with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to use the\nresources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these matters with their supervisor\nor a Human Resources Representative to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community. Career opportunities after the assistance period will not be diminished as a result of participation in the Employee\nAssistance Program. ---\n\nTeam members with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should contact\ntheir supervisor or a Human Resources Representative without fear of reprisal. #### \u00bb **Please refer to the Substance Abuse Policy for additional information.**\n\n##### Workplace Problem Resolution Policy\n\nOld National is committed to sustaining a positive work environment in which team members work constructively\ntogether. As part of this commitment, Old National encourages a candid and receptive atmosphere in which any\nproblem, complaint, question, or suggestion may be discussed, and a timely response provided from your supervisor\nand/or a member of the HR Talent team. **This Policy is intended to:**\n\n- Provide the opportunity to resolve work-related conflict or complaints at an early stage and addressmisunderstandings that may cause a communication breakdown. - Improve communication and understanding between team members and between team membersand their supervisor. - Promote flexible, creative solutions. **Team members should use this Policy to:**\n\n- Discuss concerns about difficulties you may be experiencing with coworkers or a supervisor. - Address established rules of conduct, policies, practices, or a decision that affects the terms and conditionsof your employment. Old National strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members, and everyone is expected to treat each\nother with mutual respect. If your supervisor does not resolve your issue, or you are concerned about retaliation, you may contact your next level\nsupervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services. In the event your issue is not resolved by your\nnext level supervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services, the team member has the ability to\ndiscuss it with a representative of Senior Management up to and including the appropriate department or line of\nbusiness Executive for final resolution. A Talent Manager or Talent Partner will assist the team member, if requested,\nin the escalation of the problem to Senior Management. Not every problem can be resolved to everyone\u2019s total satisfaction, but through understanding and discussion of\nmutual problems, team members and management can develop confidence in each other to move forward. This\nconfidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment. ***Complaints or concerns may also be shared anonymously through EthicsPoint.***\n\nOld National does not tolerate retaliation for good faith reports of ethical violations, misconduct, problems, complaints,\nor for using the problem resolution procedure. ---\n\n##### Corrective Action\n\nEvery team member\u2019s contribution is important to Old National\u2019s success. Both our external and internal clients depend\non a consistent level of excellence in their interactions with team members. The Company believes that everyone is\nresponsible for their performance and behavior and expects each team member to meet the expectations for their\nposition. And we believe that open, honest, and direct communication is critical to the success of each team member\nand Old National. Our corrective action process is intended to foster team member success by identifying\nunacceptable performance and the cause(s) of the unacceptable performance, agreeing on method(s) for improving\nperformance to an acceptable level, and preventing recurrence. In most cases, if you have a performance or behavior issue, your manager will work with you to provide appropriate\nperformance counseling and corrective action so that you have the opportunity to improve. However, our corrective\naction process is not necessarily progressive. This means a manager does not have to use levels of corrective action\nconsecutively. Managers reserve the right to take the level of corrective action that is appropriate for the situation and,\nif necessary, to terminate employment without implementing performance counseling and corrective action. **The level of performance counseling and corrective action depends on considerations such as:**\n\n- The nature, circumstances, and severity of the issue(s)\n\n- Timing and frequency of previous issues\n\n- The team member\u2019s overall performance\n\nCorrective action options include a verbal, written or final warning, suspension, or termination of employment.

Because facts and circumstances can vary widely and are often unique to a particular situation, the action that\u2019s\ntaken in one situation shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as setting standard for any other situations. Team members are responsible for actively engaging in the corrective action process and taking appropriate action(s)\nto improve their performance or behavior.

Those team members should work with their managers on\ndetermining a remote location to work. - Team members may be asked to work on a day when their department is officially closed. In these circumstances,non-exempt team members who work will receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times the team member\u2019s base\nrate of pay. Please contact HR Shared Services for assistance regarding the proper coding of the time. ---\n\n**If your business, branch, or department is open for the day:**\nIf inclement weather or other emergency conditions exist, team members should report to work, unless they have been\nadvised by phone, radio, or other means that the business will be closed for the day.

ORGANIZATION - DESCRIPTION\n\n#### I. Goods and Services Provided\n\nOur company has two divisions: Jacob Sheet Metal Works and Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning. Jacob Sheet Metal Works fabricates in light gauge sheet metal. We offer galvanized, black iron\n(cold rolled) metal, aluminum, stainless steel and copper. Our 10' power shear can handle up to\n16-gauge galvanized metal (the lower the number, the thicker the material). We do not do any\nwelding, including of aluminum. We solder galvanized, stainless steel and copper. Our sales\ninclude everything from small over-the-counter orders, to work performed for various industrial\nand commercial firms in our area. It is the policy of the company that over-the-counter sheet metal orders will be taken on a first\ncome, first serviced basis.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0000", "char_span": [0, 4454], "sentence_count": 79, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": null, "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0001", "keywords": ["employee", "employment", "conditioning", "workplace", "jacob"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "HARASSMENT", "MEAL", "OVERTIME", "PTO", "REST"], "hash_64": "789cadd75b77dedd", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.402076", "token_count": 997}}
{"text": "We solder galvanized, stainless steel and copper. Our sales\ninclude everything from small over-the-counter orders, to work performed for various industrial\nand commercial firms in our area. It is the policy of the company that over-the-counter sheet metal orders will be taken on a first\ncome, first serviced basis. Discretion will be used to prioritize orders that offer more revenue and\nbenefit to the company (ex: a $2000 job vs. a $10 order). The company will make every attempt\nto advise customers of an appropriate timeframe that it will take to fulfill an order. It is important to note that sheet metal ductwork used by our air conditioning division is fabricated\nin our shop and these jobs will take precedence to other sheet metal jobs due the primary nature\nof the business. Most typical duct fittings, such as elbows, boots, and collars are purchased through wholesale\ndistributors. We generally use sheet metal trunk lines, wrapped in duct wrap insulation, followed\nby flex supply runs. It is the philosophy of the company that this provides the customer with a\nsuperior duct system, and JH&A is the only company in the area that offers this. We will use\nfiberglass duct board for plenums and trunk lines as the specific job is bid. Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning conducts business in HVAC repair, maintenance, equipment\nsales and installation. Our sales are primarily residential and light commercial. In recent years\nwe have begun to take on more commercial jobs, such as the Main Street Bank in DeLand. Our\nprimary installation and repair work is for single family residences. We do not currently perform\nany refrigeration or chiller work. We occasionally do new home construction; this would typically be a custom home situation, as\nwe are not in the business of new home construction. We install and repair gas furnaces and oil-fired furnaces. We do not work on carburetor-type oil\nfurnaces. We install and repair water-to-air heat pumps. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_7_2.png)\n\nWe generally do not work on window ale units. However, we reserve the right to service a\ncustomer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two people to\nremove the customer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two\npeople to remove the window or wall unit and bring it to our shop for bench repairs. The customer\nmust be advised the repairs could be costly, and it may be beneficial to buy a new unit. #### II. Facilities and Location(s):\n\nOur offices and sheet metal shop are located at 611 E. International Speedway Blvd., DeLand FL\n\n1. This street is also known as East Highway 92. Our business is located within the DeLandcity limits.

History of Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning:\n\nJacob Sheet Metal Works was founded in 1921 by Rudolph Jacob, Robert Jacob's grandfather. He moved to DeLand from Ohio and began working with a wooden brake installing metal roofs,\ncopper work, guttering, and later warm air heating ducts. In those days, metal was shipped down\nthe St. John's River and received at the Lake Beresford settlement. After World War II Robert's father, Paul Jacob joined Rudolph in the family business. Paul\u2019s\nbrother, Ervin Jacob, also worked with the company until 1977. The business was incorporated\nin 1964. Jacob Sheet Metal Works continued as a thriving business in DeLand during the 50\u2019s, 60's and\n70\u2019s. The company started concentrating on central heating & air conditioning installations as their\npopularity grew. Throughout the years, the company has gained a reputation in West Volusia County as the topquality repair and installation company. We have many customers who have been doing business\nwith Jacob Sheet Metal 30-60 years, and we respect these people tremendously. Jacob Sheet\nMetal Works is one of DeLand's oldest businesses. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_8_2.png)\n\nRobert Jacob grew up in the family business.

In 1998 our heating & air conditioning business evolved to becoming 85% of the company's total\nsales. Even then, many people in town did not realize that the company did A/C work due to the\nname, \u201cJacob Sheet Metal Works.\u201d For that reason, Robert decided it was time to clarify the\nposition in the marketplace by creating a branch called \"Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning.\" This\nchange resulted in major growth in our company, as we now have one of the most recognized\nnames in West Volusia County. Other internal changes have occurred in recent years, including becoming more efficient. In we changed our repair pricing to \"Flat-Rate Pricing.\" This is a proven feature in our industry, which\nhas brought higher profits and stability, and allowed us to pay higher wages to our employees. We have also increased employee training and have developed a wide range of employee\nbenefits. Most important, the company is extremely proud to say it has several employees who have been\nwith the company over 10 years, and two have been with us 20 years and over. We are constantly\nstriving to increase our place in the market. Through better management, organization and\nteamwork, we become more profitable. #### IV. Organizational Structure:\n\nOur company is a corporation registered in the State of Florida. Our company is an official Qualified Business Organization in the State of Florida. Holding a State\nClass A Contractors License (CAC024345) and L.P. gas license. Fully insured with business liability and workers comp insurance. Memberships: V.A.C.C.A. (county) and A.C.C.A.

Role of the Human Resources Department:\n\nDue to the size of the company, the role of Human Resources is fulfilled through a team effort by\nthe President, the office employees, a supervisor, and you, as the employee. #### VI. Management Philosophy:\n\nIt is the philosophy of our company that we work as a team, with true success coming only through\nthe combined efforts of each and every employee. Our management philosophy is to expect\nquality work from our employees, who will receive respect, competitive wages, and above average\nbenefits in return. We believe in an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. Every employee is expected to\ncontribute his best effort, each day, to produce quality service to our customers. We believe this\nwill assure a winning combination, for the company, its employees, and also for the customer. We believe in an open-door policy and strive to create an atmosphere where employees are\nencouraged to discuss their problems openly with their superiors, without fear of reprisal, and\nshare their accomplishments with others. Every effort will be made to assure each employee is\nalways respected and treated equitably. #### VII. Goals:\n\nOur goal is to provide the highest quality service to our customers, at a fair price. In doing so we\nwill provide a profitable business in which our employees can grow while creating a loyal client\nbase within the West Volusia area. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_10_2.png)\n\n## 101. Nature of Employment\n\nThis handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel\npolicies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook,\nfor it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about\nemployment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is\nnot intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is\nbound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship\nat any time. In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A\nreserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in\nthis handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [9045, 13876], "sentence_count": 43, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["this", "every", "company", "employee", "employees"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "30cdcd474f674e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.410754", "token_count": 1021}}
{"text": "In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A\nreserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in\nthis handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will. The only recognized deviations from\nthe stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A. ## 102. Employee Relations\n\nJH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are\ncompetitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees\nhave concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice\nthese concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors,\" the\nwork environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding\neffectively to employee concerns. ## 103. Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nIn order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals,\nemployment decisions at JH&A will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. JH&A does\nnot discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,\ndisability, veteran status, national origin, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment,\ncompensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_11_2.png)\n\nAny employee with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace is\nencouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor. Employees can\nraise concerns and make reports without fear of retaliation Anyone found to be engaging in any\ntype of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination\nof employment. ## 104. Business Ethics and Conduct\n\nThe successful business operation and reputation of JH&A is built upon the principles of fair\ndealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires\ncareful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a\nscrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity. The continued success of JH&A is dependent upon our customers' trust and we are dedicated to\npreserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to JH&A, its customers, and shareholders to act in a\nway that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. JH&A will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers, and\nemployees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws\nand to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you with respect\nto lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper\ncourse of action, the matter should be discussed openly with your immediate supervisor. If\nnecessary, the matter should be escalated to Management for advice and consultation. Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every JH&A\nemployee. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct\ncould lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment. ## 105. Hiring of Relatives\n\nThe employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and\nproblems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at\nwork, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working\nrelationships. All hiring of family will be considered in a case-by-case basis in consideration of\norganizational impact. \u00b7\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_12_2.png)\n\nIn cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory\nrelationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or terminated from\nemployment. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or\nwhose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or\nmarriage. ## 106.

{"text": "## 106. Employee Medical Examinations\n\nTo help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely, medical examinations may\nbe required. After an offer has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical\nquestionnaire will be required, and a medical examination may be required at JH&A's expense by\na health professional of JH&A's choice. The offer of employment and assignment to duties is\ncontingent upon completion of the questionnaire. Any employee off work more than three continuous workdays for an unforeseen illness or injury\nmay be required to present JH&A with a written status report from a qualified healthcare provider. The status report must contain a diagnosis of the illness or injury, an acceptable explanation of\nwhy the employee cannot perform his or her job duties, and a reasonable expected return-to-work\ndate. (Also see employee policies under Section 601 \"Medical Leave\"). Information on an employee's medical condition or history will be kept separate from other\nemployee information and maintained confidentially. Access to this information will be limited to\nthose who have a legitimate need to know. ## 107. Immigration Law Compliance\n\nJH&A is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to\nwork in the United States and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or\nnational origin. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a\ncondition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form 1-9 and\npresent documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who\nare rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed a 1-9 with JH&A within the\npast three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_13_2.png)\n\nEmployees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged\nto contact the Controller. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law\ncompliance without fear of reprisal. ## 108. Conflicts of Interest\n\nEmployees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which JH&A\nwishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction\nso that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable\nstandards of operation. Contact Management for more information or questions about conflicts of\ninterest. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a\ndecision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of JH&A's\nbusiness dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood\nor marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related\nby blood or marriage. No \"presumption of guilt\" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or\nleases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of JH&A as soon as possible the existence\nof any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all\nparties. Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant\nownership in a firm with which JH&A does business, but also when an employee or relative\nreceives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any\ntransaction or business dealings involving JH&A. ## 109. Outside Employment\n\nEmployees may hold outside jobs as long as they are open and honest about their outside\nemployment with their direct supervisor and meet the performance standards of their job with\nJH&A. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to\nJH&A's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the outside\nrole precedes employment with JH&A, the employee should make the intention to maintain their\noutside position during the application/interview process with JH&A. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_14_2.png)\n\nIf JH&A determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to\nmeet the requirements of JH&A as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be\nasked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with JH&A. \"Moonlighting,\" or outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [18847, 23857], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["employee", "that", "outside", "employees", "employment"], "policy_tags": ["I-9", "REST"], "hash_64": "39cfb9576f27ee61", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.419039", "token_count": 1019}}
{"text": "\"Moonlighting,\" or outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside JH&A for\nmaterials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs. Due to various reasons, the following will be considered as unacceptable conflicts of interests:\n\n--- Working for a competitor as a direct employee or as a subcontractor\n\n--- Taking business away from JH&A by serving an existing customer\n\n--- Any business that uses JH&A time or material. It is important to note that service performed by an individual employee outside of JH&A business\nhours could be interpreted as JH&A related work from a legal perspective, and that it is against\nthe law for a homeowner to hire an unlicensed individual to perform work. JH&A is in no way\nresponsible for business performed by an individual outside of assigned jobs/duties. ## 110. Non-Disclosures\n\nThe protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and\nthe success of JH&A. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following\nexamples:\n\n--- wages or personal employee data\n\n--- computer programs and codes \u00b7\n\n--- customer lists\n\n--- customer preference\n\n--- financial information\n\n--- marketing strategies\n\n--- pricing for pending projects and proposals\n\nEmployees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business s information\nwill be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal\naction, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_15_2.png)\n\n## 111. Disability Accommodations\n\nJH&A is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring\nequal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. All employment practices\nand activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful\nemployment opportunities. Pre-employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's\nability to perform the duties of the position. Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where their disability affects\nthe performance of job functions. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the\nsituation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation\n(or changes in compensation) as well as in job assignments, classifications, organizational\nstructures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists. Leave of all types will be\navailable to all employees on an equal basis. JH&A is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified employees or applicants\nbecause they are related to or associated with a person with a disability. JH&A will follow any\nstate or local law that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA. This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. JH&A is committed to taking all other actions\nnecessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance\nwith the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. ## 112. Employment Categories\n\nIt is the intent of JH&A to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees\nunderstand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee\nemployment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the employment\nrelationship at will at any time is retained by both the employee and JH&A. Each employee is designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage\nand hour laws. NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific\nprovisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT employees are excluded from specific provisions\nof federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee's EXEMPT or NONEXEMPT classification\nmay be changed only upon written notification by JH&A management. In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong lo one other employment category:\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_16_2.png)\n\nREGULAR FULL-TIME employees are those who are not in a temporary or introductory status\nand who are regularly scheduled to work JH&A's full-time schedule.

While they do receive all legally\nmandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are\nineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. INTRODUCTORY employees are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine\nwhether further employment in a specific position or with JH&A is appropriate. Employees who\nsatisfactorily complete the introductory period will be notified of their new employment\nclassification. TEMPORARY employees are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily\nsupplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment\nassignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated\nperiod does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain\nthat status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally\nmandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are\nineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. CASUAL employees are tho.se who have established an employment relationship with JH&A but\nwho are assigned to work on an intermittent and/or unpredictable basis. While they receive all\nlegally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they\nare ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. ## 113. Access to Personnel Files\n\nJH&A maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information\nas the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance\nappraisals and salary increases, and other employment records. Personnel files are the property of JH&A, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of JH&A who have a legitimate reason\nto review information in a file are allowed to do so. Employees who wish to review their own file should contact their manager. With reasonable\nadvance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in JH&A's offices and in the\npresence of an individual appointed by JH&A to maintain the files. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_17_2.png)\n\n## 114. Employment Reference Checks\n\nTo ensure that individuals who join JH&A are well qualified and have a strong potential to be\nproductive and successful, it is the policy of JH&A to check the references of all applicants. All\napplicants will be asked, in writing, to authorize background checks for felony convictions, driver\u2019s\nlicense reports, workers comp reports, and a nation-wide search on sex offender violations. The\ninformation obtained from the screening will be considered on a case by case basis and each\nsituation will be considered individually. Management will respond in writing only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in\nwriting. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and\nposition(s) held. ## 115. Personnel Data Changes\n\nIt is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify JH&A of any changes in personnel\ndata. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents,\nindividuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, and other\nsuch status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personnel data has\nchanged, notify the Office Manager. ## 116. Introductory Period\n\nThe introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their\nability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position\nmeets their expectations. JH&A uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits,\nand overall performance. Either the employee or JH&A may end the employment relationship at\nwill at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice. All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after\ntheir date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the\nlength of the absence. If JH&A determines that the designated introductory period does not allow\nsufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may\nbe extended for a specified period. Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the \"regular\"\nemployment classification.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0006", "char_span": [28875, 33768], "sentence_count": 37, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0005", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0007", "keywords": ["employees", "introductory", "employment", "personnel", "period"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "2acdb9574f776e61", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.427284", "token_count": 966}}

After becoming regular\nemployees, they may also be eligible for other JH&A provided benefits, subject to the terms and\nconditions of each benefits program. Employees should read the information for each specific\nbenefits program for the details on eligibility requirements. Your employment with JH&A is a voluntary one and is subject to termination by you or JH&A at\nwill, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall\nbe interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the employment-at-will\nstatus of JH&A employees. This policy of employment-at-will may not be modified by any officer or employee and shall not\nbe modified in any publication or document. The only exception to this policy is a written\nemployment agreement approved at the discretion of the President or the Board of Directors,\nwhichever is applicable. ## 117. Employment Applications\n\nJH&A relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well\nas the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any\nmisrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may\nresult in JH&A's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the\nperson has been hired, termination of employment. ## 118. Performance Evaluation\n\nSupervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an\ninformal, day-to-day basis. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide\nboth supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct\nweaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches\nfor meeting goals. Performance evaluations are scheduled approximately every 12 months, generally occurring in\nthe late spring. Merit-based pay adjustments are awarded by JH&A in an effort to recognize truly superior\nemployee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous\nfactors, including the information documented by this formal performance evaluation process. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_19_2.png)\n\n## 119. Employee Benefits\n\nEligible employees at JH&A are provided a wide range of benefits. A number of the programs\n(such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance)\ncover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your\nsupervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs\ncan be found elsewhere in the employee handbook. The following benefit programs are available to eligible employees:\n\n--- COBRA Major Medical Benefit Conversion at Termination\n\n--- Drug or Alcohol Rehabilitation Program (at employee's own expense)\n\n--- Employee Assistance Program (through the Drug Free Workplace)\n\n--- Family Leave (as required by Law)\n\n--- Holidays\n\n--- Major Medical Insurance for Employee\n\n--- Dependent Major Medical Insurance through payroll deduction\n\n--- Pharmacy (prescription drug plan included in Major Medical Insurance)\n\n--- Paid Time Off (PTO is similar to Vacation & Sick Leave)\n\n--- Pension Plan/ Simple IRA Contributions with Company matching (matching amount\ndecided by retirement plan provider)\n\n--- Spiffs*\n\n--- Supplemental Plans through payroll deduction:\n\n- (Dental, Short-Term Disability, Accident, Hospital Indemnity, and Cancer Plans)\n--- Uniforms\n\n--- Voting Time Off\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_20_2.png)\n\nSome benefit programs require contributions from employees, but most are paid by JH&A. The\nbenefit package for regular full-time employees represents an additional cost to JH&A of\napproximately 32 percent of wages. Due to government regulations, there may be a waiting period required for certain benefits.

Holidays\n\n--- JH&A will grant holiday time off to all employees on the holidays listed below:\n\n--- New Year's Day (January 1)\n\n--- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)\n\n--- Independence Day (July 4)\n\n--- Labor Day (first Monday in September)\n\n--- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)\n\n--- Christmas (December 25)\n\nJH&A will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees immediately upon assignment to an\neligible employment classification. Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee's\nstraight-time pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee\nwould otherwise have worked on that day. Eligible employee classification(s):\n\n--- Regular full-time employees\n\nA recognized holiday that falls on a Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday. A\nrecognized holiday that falls on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday. If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's paid absence (such as vacation or sick\nleave), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have\napplied. If eligible nonexempt employees work on a recognized holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus\nwages at their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. Due to business needs,\nthere will be on-call requirements for Service Technicians and those who are deemed as \u201con-call\u201d\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_21_2.png)\n\nwill inevitably work holidays. The holiday on-call schedule will be determined in advance and\nrequests for PTO will be accommodated the best of JH&A\u2019s ability, but are not guaranteed. Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining\nwhether overtime pay is owed. ## 121. Workers' Compensation Insurance\n\nJH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to\nemployees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that\nrequires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements,\nworkers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee\nis hospitalized, immediately. Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor\nimmediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be\nreported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as\npossible. Depending on the requirements of the Worker\u2019s Compensation insurance provider, and\nthe situation, a drug and/or alcohol test may be required of the employee to submit a claim. Neither JH&A nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation\nbenefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty\nrecreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by JH&A. ## 122. Time Off to Vote\n\nJH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work\nschedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, JH&A will\ngrant up to 1 hour of paid time off to vote. Employees should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two working days prior to\nthe election day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at\nthe beginning or end of the work shift, whichever provides the least disruption to the normal work\nschedule. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_22_2.png)\n\n## 123. Jury Duty\n\nJH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when\nrequired. JH&A will pay an employee for up to 5 days of jury duty, with proof of summons. After days, employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired,\nemployees may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits). Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the\nsupervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Employees are expected to\nreport for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the\nemployee's absence would create serious operational difficulties.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0008", "char_span": [38813, 43727], "sentence_count": 36, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0007", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0009", "keywords": ["will", "employees", "time", "holiday", "that"], "policy_tags": ["OVERTIME", "PTO"], "hash_64": "2bcf99df77734c61", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.436069", "token_count": 1005}}

Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the\nemployee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. JH&A will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave. ## 124. Witness Duty\n\nJH&A encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by JH&A,\nthey will receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. Employees will be granted unpaid time off to appear in court as a witness when requested by a\nparty other than JH&A. Employees are free to use any available paid leave benefit (such as\nvacation leave) to receive compensation for the period of this absence. The subpoena should be shown to the employee's supervisor immediately after it is received so\nthat operating requirements can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee's\nabsence. The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. ## 125. Benefits Continuation (COBRA)\n\nThe federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and\ntheir qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under JH&A's\nhealth plan when a \"qualifying event\" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_23_2.png)\n\nqualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a\nreduction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal\nseparation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at JH&A's group rates\nplus an administration fee. JH&A provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing\nrights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under JH&A's\nhealth insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations. ## 126. Educational Assistance\n\nJH&A recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the\norganization. Individual courses or courses that are part of a degree, licensing, or certification program must be\nrelated to the employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position in the organization in\norder to be eligible for educational assistance. JH&A has the sole discretion to determine whether\na course relates to an employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position. Employees\nshould contact Management for more information or questions about educational assistance and\nfinancial availability for educational assistance. The following pay guidelines will apply when employees are attending classes, seminars and\neducational courses, and their attendance is specifically required by Jacob Heating & Air\nConditioning:\n\n--- Employees attending company-required classes during their regular workday hours, Monday\nthrough Friday, will be paid a total of their hours worked and the hours spent in class and travel\nduring the day. --- Employees attending company-required classes commencing and ending after their regular\nworkday hours, will be paid overtime wages for time spent in class beyond their regular 40-hour\nwork week. --- Any courses pursued for personal development, which are not company mandated, can be\nconsidered to be financed through the company, but hourly wages will not be paid to the employee\nfor their time. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_24_2.png)\n\n## 127. Paid Time OFF (PTO)\n\nPaid Time Off (PTO) is an all-purpose time-off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation,\nillness or injury, and personal business. It combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into\none flexible, paid time-off policy. Employees in the following employment classification(s) are\neligible to earn and use PTO as described in this policy:\n\n--- Regular full-time employees\n\nOnce employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to accrue PTO according\nto the schedule below. Accrued PTO is available for use immediately after accrual. PTO can be\nused in minimum increments of one-half hour. The employee\u2019s accrued balance will be capped at the maximum PTO balance amount listed in\nthe PTO schedule. PTO accrued in excess of this maximum balance amount will be lost.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0009", "char_span": [43727, 48608], "sentence_count": 33, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0008", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0010", "keywords": ["employees", "will", "paid", "their", "employee"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "OVERTIME", "PTO", "SICK LEAVE"], "hash_64": "3bcde9575f62667b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.440680", "token_count": 995}}
{"text": "Accumulation of PTO stops when an employee is absent during personal\ntime off. ## 128. Health Insurance\n\nJH&A's health insurance plan provides employees and their dependents access to medical\ninsurance benefits. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to\nparticipate in the health insurance plan:\n\n--- Regular full-time employees\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_26_2.png)\n\nEligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions\nof the agreement between JH&A and the insurance carrier. A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the\nhealth insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) policy\nfor more information. Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An\nSPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible\nemployees. Contact the Administrative Office for more information about health insurance\nbenefits. ## 129. Timekeeping\n\nAccurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and\nstate laws require JH&A to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee\npay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Hourly nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work,\nas well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the\nbeginning and ending time of any departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must\nalways be approved before it is performed. Time sheets are available in the office. If a specific day's time sheet is not available, employees\nshould inform the office personnel immediately. It is the employee's responsibility to tum in their timecard on a timely basis. Failure to do so could\nresult in a delay of pay. A time sheet must be turned in even when the employee is on vacation, out sick, or taking\npersonal time off. The time sheet should be marked with an explanation of the absence. It is the employee's responsibility to sign their time sheet to certify the accuracy of all time\nrecorded. Office personnel will review the time record for accuracy before payroll processing. If\nan employee has not correctly documented his or her time, corrections will be made in the total\nhours worked, according to the stop and start times recorded. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time\nrecord may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_27_2.png)\n\n## 130. Paydays\n\nAll employees are paid weekly. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed\nthrough the end of the previous payroll period. Our payroll period runs from Wednesday to\nTuesday. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a holiday, employees\nwill receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday, unless the office\npersonnel are unable to complete payroll due to unforeseen circumstances. In such case,\nemployees will receive pay on the first day of work after the regularly scheduled payday. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee may receive his or her\nearned wages before departing for vacation if a written request is submitted to the office at least\none week prior to departing for vacation. ## 131. Employment Terminations\n\nTermination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and\nmany of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common\ncircumstances under which employment is terminated:\n\n--- Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee. --- Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization. --- Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for nondisciplinary reasons. Since employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent, both the employee and JH&A have\nthe right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time. Employees will\nreceive their final pay in accordance with applicable state law. Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. All\naccrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid. Some benefits may\nbe continued at the employee's expense if the employee so chooses.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0011", "char_span": [52340, 57293], "sentence_count": 43, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0010", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0012", "keywords": ["time", "employment", "employees", "employee", "insurance"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "MEAL", "OVERTIME", "PTO"], "hash_64": "390ba9474d236661", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.449082", "token_count": 996}}

On-Call Pay\n\nAll field technicians are provided with on-call stipends in the instance of being required to report\nto work on weekends. All notice of potential work should be provided by management to the\nemployee(s) by the afternoon prior in order to allow for the employee to have adequate\npreparation. ## 133. Administrative Pay Corrections\n\nJH&A takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in\neach paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly\nbring the discrepancy to the attention of Management so that corrections can be made as quickly\nas possible. ## 134. Pay Deductions and Setoffs\n\nThe law requires that JH&A make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. JH&A also must deduct Social\nSecurity taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security\n\"wage base.\" JH&A matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee. JH&A offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law. Eligible employees may\nvoluntarily authorize deductions from their pay checks to cover the costs of participation in these\nprograms. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by JH&A, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to JH&A\nor others. Certain pay deductions, such as wage garnishments, credit union and insurance plans, art\ndirected by law and cannot be altered by JH&A. Even though an employee may work a limited\nnumber of hours in a given payroll week, specific deductions must be made. Employees cannot\nchoose to cancel certain deductions for a specific payroll period. If an employee does not have\nenough earned wages to support such a required payroll deduction, the deduction may be taken\nin the following weeks until the obligation is paid. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_29_2.png)\n\nIf you have questions concerning why deductions were made from your pay check or how they\nwere calculated, your supervisor can assist in having your questions answered. ## 135. Safety\n\nTo assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and\nvisitors, JH&A has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for\nJH&A. Management is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating\nthe safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. An M.S.D.S. application (Material Safety Data Sheets) for materials and chemicals used in our\nworkplace is also provided on smart devices in each vehicle. Employees may view the Safety\nProgram Manual or the digital M.S.D.S. sheets at any time, and are responsible for maintaining\naccess via single sign on through the provided application. JH&A provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through\nregular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board\npostings, memos, or other written communications. Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers\npotential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or\nminimize hazards. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns,\nor suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their\nsupervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the President. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who\nfail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment. In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear,\nemployees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0012", "char_span": [57293, 62383], "sentence_count": 42, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0011", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0013", "keywords": ["safety", "employees", "that", "employee", "deductions"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "3b4d8c474d334671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.453864", "token_count": 1019}}

Work Schedules\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_30_2.png)\n\nThe normal work schedule for all employees is 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Supervisors will\nadvise employees of the times their schedules will normally begin and end. Staffing needs and\noperational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations\nin the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. ## 137. Use of Phone System & Cell Phones\n\nPersonal use of a company telephone for long-distance and toll calls is not permitted. Employees\nshould practice discretion when making local personal calls and may be required to reimburse\nJH&A for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone. Use of cell phones for personal calls during regular working hours is not permitted. Employees should practice discretion and inform their family and friends of the company's policy\nregarding this issue. Personal use of cell phones could lead to suspension and termination. Employees who have been assigned a cell phone will use it only for official company business. To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always employ customer\nservice best practices. ## 138. Smoking\n\nIn keeping with JH&A's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking in the\nworkplace is discouraged. Nonsmoking areas are clearly designated where smoking is expressly\nprohibited, and employees are asked to respect these designations. In situations where the\npreferences of smokers and nonsmokers are in direct conflict, the preferences of nonsmokers will\nprevail. A customer may prohibit smoking on his property. In these situations, the customer\u2019s preference\nwill prevail; smoking will not be allowed, except inside the company's vehicle. Smoking in the attic,\nunder or inside the home of a customer is strictly prohibited, as is discarding cigarette butts,\ncigarette packages, or lighters. This policy applies equally to all employees, customers, and visitors. ## 139. Meal Periods\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_31_2.png)\n\nAll full-time regular employees are provided with one meal period of 30 minutes in length each\nworkday. Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. Employees will be relieved of all active responsibilities and restrictions during meal periods and\nwill not be compensated for that time. A minimum of a 15 minute meal period is required of all employees each day. ## 140. Overtime\n\nWhen operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours,\nemployees may be scheduled to work overtime hours. When possible, advance notification of\nthese mandatory assignments will be provided. All overtime work must receive the supervisor's\nprior authorization. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as practical to all employees qualified to\nperform the required work. Overtime compensation is paid to all nonexempt employees in accordance with federal and state\nwage and hour restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. JH&A's overtime pay rate is regular hourly wage\n(x) 1.5. Overtime pay is general paid for time worked over 40 hours per payroll week, with the\nfollowing exception: Employees will always be paid overtime for hours worked on Sunday. Failure to work assigned overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including possible\ntermination of employment. ## 141. Use of Equipment and Vehicles\n\nCOMPANY-SUPPLIED TOOLS & EQUIPMENT:\n\nTools & Equipment essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to\nreplace. When using tools, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required\nmaintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines.

The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment can result\nin disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Each employee who has been assigned a vehicle will be given a list of company-supplied tools &\nequipment. The employee will be required to sign the list, verifying the items are on the truck. A\ncopy of this form will be kept in the office. Periodic inspections will be made to assure that each\nvehicle contains the items, and employees will be held accountable if the items are not found on\nthe vehicle. COMPANY VEHICLES:\n\nLikewise, vehicles are expensive and essential pieces of property in any business. Care &\nmaintenance is required by all employees. Improper use, carelessness, and unsafe operation of\nany company vehicle (including excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations) will result in\ntermination of employment. Employees will be required to make a monthly assessment of the operating condition of their\nassigned vehicles. This assessment will be in the form of a report, to be filled out as requested\nduring one of JH&A's weekly meetings. All company vehicles shall have typical maintenance performed every 3 months, as directed by\nthe company and manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, at a local service center. Employees may be asked\nto assist in performing the maintenance items. Periodic service check-up reports are posted for all vehicles. The employee assigned to a vehicle\nwill be held responsible for its safety and maintenance. Specifically, when a vehicle report is\nposted for a service interval, the employee assigned to the vehicle will be held responsible to get\nit performed. The employee should contact the office to schedule the service. The following policies apply to all employees who drive a company vehicle:\n\n1. Company vehicles shall be used only for company-related business, driven back & forthto the work site, and not used for personal business. 1.

A form indicating the employee's choice will be given to each Service Technician for\nhis signature. A copy will be placed in the employee's personnel file. The company's position on this matter is that the employee should be aware he does not need to\nprovide his own vehicle to drive to work, and he does not pay gas, insurance or wear and tear on\nhis own vehicle. If the Service Technician chooses to drive the company vehicle home, his wages will begin when\nhe is dispatched to his first call of the day. The employee\u2019s wages will end when he completes his\nlast call of the day, unless he is outside a 10-mile radius of his home. In such case, the employee\nwill be paid until crossing the 10-mile radius. Drive time from the employee's home to the shop for a Company meeting or training session will\nnot be compensated. When the Service Technician is \"on-call\" and is required to leave his home for an emergency\nservice call, wages will be paid from the employee's home to the customer and drive time back.

All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible\nto your immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by\nemployees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work\nstation, do not try to intercede or see what is happening.

Medical Leave\n\nJH&A provides medical leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who are temporarily\nunable to work due to a serious health condition or disability. For purposes of this policy, serious\nhealth conditions or disabilities include inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical\ncare facility; continuing treatment by a health care provider; and temporary disabilities associated\nwith pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request medical leave as\ndescribed in this policy. --- Regular full-time employees\n\nEligible employees may request medical leave only after having completed 365 calendar days of\nservice. Exceptions to the service requirement will be considered to accommodate disabilities. Eligible employees should make requests for medical leave to their supervisors at least 30 days\nin advance of foreseeable events and as soon as possible for unforeseeable events. A health care provider's statement must be submitted verifying the need for medical leave and its\nbeginning and expected ending dates. Any changes in this information should be promptly\nreported to JH&A. Employees returning from medical leave must submit a health care provider's\nverification of their fitness to return to work. Eligible employees are normally granted leave for the period of the disability, up to a maximum of\n6 weeks within any 12-month period. Any combination of medical leave and family leave may not\nexceed this maximum limit. If the initial period of approved absence proves insufficient,\nconsideration will be given to a request for an extension. Employees will be required to first use\nany accrued paid leave time before taking unpaid medical leave. Employees who sustain work-related injuries are eligible for a medical leave of absence for the\nperiod of disability in accordance with all applicable laws covering occupational disabilities. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits\nwill be provided by JH&A until the end of the month in which the medical leave begins. At that\ntime, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_42_2.png)\n\nlo continue. When the employee returns from medical leave, benefits will again be provided by\nJH&A according to the applicable plans. The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during\nthe leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as Dental, AFLAC, and disability\nplans must continue to be paid by our company in order for the plans to stay in effect. Employees\ntaking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A while off work. Every effort will be\nmade to keep these supplemental plans in force. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the\nleave and will resume upon return to active employment. So that an employee's return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on medical leave\nis requested to provide JH&A with at least two weeks\u2019 advance notice of the date the employee\nintends to return to work. When a medical leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same\nposition, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified. If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed upon return date, JH&A will assume that the\nemployee has resigned. ## 150.

Every effort will be\nmade to keep these supplemental plans in force. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the\nleave and will resume upon return to active employment. So that an employee's return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on family leave is\nrequested to provide JH&A with at least two weeks\u2019 advance notice of the date the employee\nintends to return to work. When a family leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same\nposition, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified. If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed upon return date, JH&A will assume that the\nemployee has resigned. ## 151. Personal & Bereavement Leave\n\nJH&A will consider leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off\nfrom work duties to fulfill personal obligations. Employees in the following employment\nclassification(s) are eligible to request personal leave as described in this policy:\n\n--- Regular full-time employees\n\nEligible employees may request personal leave only after having completed 90 calendar days of\nservice. As soon as eligible employees become aware of the need for a personal leave of\nabsence, they should request a leave from Management. Personal leave may be granted for a period of not to exceed 5 calendar days per one-year period. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request\nfor a single extension of no more than 3 calendar days. With the supervisor's approval, an\nemployee must take any available vacation paid time off first as part of the approved period. Requests for personal leave will be evaluated based on a number of factors, including anticipated\nwork load requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence. Employees should not assume they will be granted their request for personal time off. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits\nwill be provided by Il-I&A until the end of the month in which the approved personal leave begins. At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish\ncoverage to continue. When the employee returns from personal leave, benefits will again be\nprovided by JH&A according to the-applicable plans. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_44_2.png)\n\nThe employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during\nthe leave of absence.

{"text": "When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the\nsame position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified. However, JH&A cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period,\nJH&A will assume the employee has resigned. Each employee is eligible for bereavement leave of up to 3 business days for direct family\n(parents, siblings, grandparents, children). Bereavement leave does not apply to non-direct family\nmembers, and PTO usage would be required for anyone outside of these parameters. ## 152. Employee Conduct and Work Rules\n\nTo ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, JH&A expects\nemployees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and\nthe organization. It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment:\n\n--- Unsafe or negligent operation of company-owned vehicles. --- Excessive traffic violations. --- Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property\n\n--- Falsification of timekeeping records\n\n--- Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs\n\n--- Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace,\nwhile on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_45_2.png)\n\n--- Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace\n\n--- Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace\n\n--- Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of e1nployer-owned or customerowned property\n\n--- Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct\n\n--- Violation of safety or health rules\n\n--- Smoking in prohibited areas\n\n--- Sexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment\n\n--- Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in\nthe workplace\n\n--- Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice\n\n--- Unauthorized absence from work station during the workday\n\n--- Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment\n\n--- Unauthorized disclosure of business \"secrets\" or confidential information\n\n--- Violation of personnel policies\n\n--- Unsatisfactory performance or conduct\n\nEmployment with JH&A is at the mutual consent of JH&A and the employee, and either party may\nterminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. ## 153. Drug and Alcohol Use\n\nIt is JH&A's desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal,\nemployees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform\ntheir jobs in a satisfactory manner. While on JH&A premises and while conducting business-related activities off JH&A premises, no\nemployee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's\nability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not\nendanger other individuals in the workplace. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_46_2.png)\n\nViolations this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of\nemployment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment\nprogram. Such violations may also have legal consequences. To inform employees about important provisions of this policy, JH&A has established a drug-free\nawareness program. The program provides information on the dangers and effects of substance\nabuse in the workplace, resources available to employees, and consequences for violations of\nthis policy. Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged\nto use the resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these\nmatters with their supervisor or the President to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate\nresources in the community. Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate\nsubject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a\nrehabilitation or treatment program through JH&A's health insurance benefit coverage. Leave may\nbe granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all\nJH&A policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the\nleave will not cause JH&A any undue hardship.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0020", "char_span": [96809, 101900], "sentence_count": 24, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0019", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0021", "keywords": ["employee", "conduct", "leave", "employees", "that"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "PTO", "REST"], "hash_64": "29efbcc75f626e73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.488248", "token_count": 1017}}

Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace\nshould raise their concerns with their supervisor or the President without fear of reprisal. ## 154. Sexual and Other Unlawful\n## Harassment\n\nJH&A is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful\nharassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity,\nage, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. As an example,\nsexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of employee misconduct that is demeaning\nto another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly\nprohibited. Any employee who wants to report an incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment should\npromptly report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the employee\nbelieves it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately\ncontact the President or any other member of management. Employees can raise concerns and\nmake reports without fear of reprisal. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_47_2.png)\n\nAny supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment\nshould promptly advise the President or any member of management who will handle the matter\nin a timely and confidential manner. Anyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up\nto and including termination of employment. ## 155. Attendance and Punctuality\n\nTo maintain a safe and productive work environment, JH&A expects employees to be reliable and\nto be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. Absenteeism and tardiness places a burden on\nother employees and on JH&A. In the rare instance when an employee cannot avoid being late\nto work or is unable to work as scheduled, he or she must notify their supervisor as soon as\npossible. It is imperative to notify the office staff, as well as the manager, in order to minimize\nbusiness disruption. Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Either may lead to disciplinary action, up\nto and including termination of employment. ## 156. Personal Appearance\n\nDress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees\nand affect the business image JH&A presents to customers and visitors. During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to\ndress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work\ninappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in proper attire. Under\nsuch circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work. PROPER WORK CLOTHING INCLUDES:\n\n--- Uniform clothing including shirts, polo shirts, T-shirts, pants, blue jeans and shorts,\nissued by Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning and branded accordingly. --- Jackets and coveralls provided by JH&A. --- Baseball caps provided by JH&A. --- Work shoes or boots, provided by the employee. ---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_48_2.png)\n\nNOTE: Personal shirts, T-shirts, jackets and caps and hats with printing other than the official\nJH&A logos are not allowed. Cut-offs, torn or tattered blue jeans are not allowed. Consult your supervisor or the Controller if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate\nattire. ASSIGNMENT OF UNIFORMS:\n\nUpon completion of the Probation Period (or before, if deemed by supervisor), Regular Employees\nwill be assigned uniforms. Office Personnel will receive the appropriate shirts. All other employees will be supplied uniforms\nthrough the uniform service. Safe footwear is the responsibility of each employee. 1. Maintenance on all uniforms will be performed by the employee. If necessary,arrangements for repairs can be made through JH&A; contact management. 1. The replacement of uniforms will be made by JH&A as management deems necessary.The employee is expected to take due care and is responsible for lost articles.

Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning reserves the right to change the uniform plan at any time, to\nadd or change the requirements, and to select services outside of the company, as management\ndeems necessary. ## 157. Return of Property\n\nEmployees are responsible for items issued to them by JH&A or in their possession or control,\nsuch as the following:\n\n--- company training materials\n\n--- client lists\n\n--- credit cards\n\n--- company-owned equipment & tools\n\n--- keys\n\n--- manuals\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_49_2.png)\n\n--- pagers\n\n--- protective equipment\n\n--- uniforms\n\n--- price books & any written company materials\n\nAll JH&A property must be returned by employees on or before their last day of work. Where\npermitted by applicable laws, JH&A may withhold from the employee's check or final paycheck\nthe cost of any items that are not returned when required. JH&A may also take all action deemed\nappropriate to recover or protect its property. ## 158. Resignation\n\nResignation is a voluntary act initiated by the employee to terminate employment with JH&A. Although advance notice is not required, JH&A requests at least 2 weeks written resignation\nnotice from all employees. Prior to an employee's departure, an exit interview may be scheduled to discuss the reasons for\nresignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits. ## 159. Security Inspections\n\nJH&A wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms,\nexplosives, or other improper materials. To this end, JH&A prohibits the possession, transfer,\nsale, or use of such materials on its premises. JH&A requires the cooperation of all employees in\nadministering this policy. Company vehicles, desks, drawers, bins, and other storage devices may be provided for the\nconvenience of employees but remain the sole property of JH&A. Accordingly, they, as well as\nany articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or representative of JH&A at any\ntime, either with or without prior notice. JH&A likewise wishes to discourage theft or unauthorized possession of the property of\nemployees, JH&A, visitors, and customers. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, JH&A or its\nrepresentative may inspect not only company vehicles, desks, and drawers but also persons\nentering and/or leaving the premises and any packages or other belongings. Any employee who\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_50_2.png)\n\nwishes to avoid inspection of any articles or materials should not bring such items onto JH&A's\npremises. ## 160. Solicitation\n\nIn an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by\nJH&A may not solicit or distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose. JH&A recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the\nworkplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities\nduring working time. (Working time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other\nperiods in which employees are not on duty.)\n\nIn addition, the posting of written solicitations on company bulletin boards is restricted. These\nbulletin boards display important information, and employees should consult them frequently for:\n\n--- Employee announcements\n\n--- Internal memoranda\n\n--- Organization announcements\n\n--- Workers' compensation insurance information\n\n--- State disability insurance/unemployment insurance information. If employees have a message of interest to the workplace, they may submit it to the Controller for\napproval. All approved messages will be posted by the Controller. ## 161. Drug Testing\n\nJH&A is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all\nemployees. Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious\nsafety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants\nand employees may be asked to provide body substance samples (such as urine and/or blood)\nto determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, in a case where a Worker\u2019s\nComp claim is submitted, drug or alcohol screening may be required. Refusal to submit to drug\ntesting may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0022", "char_span": [106717, 111517], "sentence_count": 36, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0021", "next_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0023", "keywords": ["employees", "employee", "company", "resignation", "items"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "2dcf09475733ae63", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.496297", "token_count": 1010}}

Participation\nin the EAP after the disciplinary process has begun may not preclude disciplinary action, up to\nand including termination of employment. Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all employees. Employees will be asked to\nsign an acknowledgement form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy. Questions concerning this policy or its administration should be directed to the Controller. ## 162. Progressive Discipline\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to stale JH&A's position on administering equitable and consistent\ndiscipline for unsatisfacto1y conduct in the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one\nthat does not have to be enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all\nemployment levels. JH&A's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain\nthat disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary\naction is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory\nservice in the future. Although employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent and both the employee and JH&A\nhave the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, JH&A\nmay use progressive discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension\nwith or without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and\nthe number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will\nnormally be followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed\nby a written warning; another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may\nthen lead to termination of employment. JH&A recognizes that there are certain types of employee problems that are serious enough to\njustify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going\nthrough the usual progressive discipline steps. While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be deemed a serious offense, the\nEmployee Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in\nimmediate suspension or termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all\n\n---\n\n![heating & air conditioning \u2018since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_52_2.png)\n\nnecessarily serious offenses, but may be examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger\nprogressive discipline. By using progressive discipline, we hope that most employee problems can be corrected at an\nearly stage, benefiting both the employee and JH&A. ## 163. Life-Threatening Illnesses in the\n## Workplace\n\nEmployees with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to\ncontinue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. JH&A\nsupports these endeavors as long as employees are able to meet acceptable performance\nstandards and don\u2019t pose a health risk to other employees. As in the case of other disabilities,\nJH&A will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal\n\nrequirements, to allow qualified employees with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential\nfunctions of their jobs. Medical information on individual employees is treated confidentially. JH&A will take reasonable\nprecautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other\nemployees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of employee medical\ninformation. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination of employment. ---", "metadata": {"doc_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md", "company": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Jacob Heating And Cooling", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0023", "char_span": [111517, 116252], "sentence_count": 30, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling.md_chunk_0022", "next_chunk_id": null, "keywords": ["disciplinary", "that", "employee", "employees", "termination"], "policy_tags": ["REST", "WARN"], "hash_64": "398fa9574f650e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.499985", "token_count": 928}}

While this handbook is not intended to be a book of rules and regulations or a\n\n---\n\ncontract, it does include some important guidelines which employees should know. Except for the at-will employment provisions, the handbook can be amended at any time. This employee handbook will not answer every question employees may have, nor would\nthe Company want to restrict the normal question and answer interchange among us. It\nis in our person-to-person conversations that we can better know each other, express our\nviews, and work together in a harmonious relationship. We hope this guide will help employees feel comfortable with us. The Company depends\non its employees; their success is our success. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions. Every manager will gladly answer them. We believe employees will enjoy their work and\ntheir fellow employees here. We also believe that employees will find the Company a\ngood place to work. No one other than authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this\nemployee handbook. No statement or promise by a supervisor, manager, or designee is\nto be interpreted as a change in policy, nor will it constitute an agreement with an\nemployee. Should any provision in this employee handbook be found to be unenforceable and\ninvalid, such a finding does not invalidate the entire employee handbook, but only the\nsubject provision. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights\nunder Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or be incompatible with the\nNLRA. We ask that employees read this guide carefully, become familiar with the Company and\nour policies, and refer to it whenever questions arise. ---\n\n**EMPLOYMENT**\n\n**E** **QUAL** **E** **MPLOYMENT**\nIt is the policy of the Company to provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified\nindividuals and to administer all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to\nthe following:\n\n- Race\n- Color\n- Age\n- Sex\n- Sexual orientation\n- Gender\n- Gender identity\n- Religion\n- National origin\n- Pregnancy\n- Physical or mental disability\n- Use of a service animal\n- Military or veteran status\n- Marital status, including domestic partnerships and civil unions\n- Atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait\n- Traits historically associated with race, such as hairstyle\n- Unemployment status\n- Exercise of civil rights\n- Citizenship and/or immigration status\n- Child or spousal support withholding\n- Wage garnishment for consumer debt\n- Genetic information, including family medical history\n- AIDS/HIV\n- Display of the American flag in the workplace\n- Source of lawful income for rent or mortgage payments\n- Status as a smoker or non-smoker\n- Any other protected class, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and locallaws\n\nThe Company takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and\nretaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

The background check may consist of prior employment verification,\nreference checks, education confirmation, criminal background, credit history, or other\ninformation, as permitted by law. Third-party services may be hired to perform these\nchecks. All offers of employment and continued employment are contingent upon a\nsatisfactory background check. Refusal to consent to a background check may result in\ndiscipline, up to or including termination. **A** **T** **-W** **ILL** **N** **OTICE**\nThe employment relationship between the Company and employees is at-will. This means\nthat employees are not hired for any specified period of time and their employment may\nbe terminated at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either\nthe Company or the employee. Company policy requires that all employees are at-will;\nany implied, oral, or written agreements or promises to the contrary are void and\nunenforceable, unless approved by an officer with the power to create an employment\ncontract. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other\nCompany document or written or verbal statement or policy. **A** **NNIVERSARY** **D** **ATE AND** **S** **ENIORITY**\nThe employee\u2019s date of hire is their official employment anniversary date. Seniority is the\nlength of continuous service starting on that date. Should an employee leave the\nCompany and then be rehired, previously accrued seniority will be lost and seniority will\nbegin to accrue again on the date of rehire. With the exception of certain protected leaves\nand paid time off, seniority does not accrue during leaves of absence that exceed calendar days. **I** **MMIGRATION** **L** **AW** **C** **OMPLIANCE**\nAll employees are required to complete Section 1 of Form I-9 on their first day of\nemployment, and produce, within three business days, acceptable proof of their identity\nand eligibility to work in the United States. Failure to produce the proper identifying\ndocuments within three days will result in termination. **I** **NTRODUCTORY** **P** **ERIOD**\nThe employee's first 90 days of employment with the Company are considered an\nintroductory period. This introductory period will be a time for getting to know fellow\nemployees, managers and the tasks involved in the position, as well as becoming familiar\nwith the Company's products and services. The supervisor or manager will work closely\nwith each employee to help them understand the needs and processes of their job. This introductory period is a try-out time for the employee and the Company. During this\nintroductory period, the Company will evaluate employees' suitability for employment\nand employees can evaluate the Company as well. At any time during this first 90 days,\nemployees may resign. If, during this period, employee work habits, attitude, attendance,\n\n---\n\nperformance or other relevant factors do not measure up to our standards, the Company\nmay terminate employment. At the end of the introductory period, the supervisor or manager will discuss each\nemployee's job performance with them. During the course of the discussion, employees\nare encouraged to give their comments and ideas as well. Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment for any\nspecified period of time, nor does it require that an employee be discharged only for\ncause. Completion of the introductory period also does not imply that employees now\nhave a contract of employment with the Company, other than at-will. Successful\ncompletion of the introductory period does not alter the at-will employment relationship. A former employee who has been rehired after a separation from the Company of more\nthan one year is considered an introductory employee during their first 90 days following\nrehire. **E** **MPLOYMENT** **C** **LASSIFICATIONS**\nThe Company has established the following employee classifications for compensation\nand benefit purposes only. An employee's supervisor or manager will inform the\nemployee of their classification, status, and responsibilities at the time of hire, re-hire,\npromotion or at any time a change in status occurs. These classifications do not alter the\nemployment at-will status. Regular Full-Time Employee\nAn employee who is regularly scheduled to work no less than 30 hours/week.

Such files may include employee personnel files, attendance\nfiles, I-9 files, and files for medical purposes. Employees are required to notify their\nmanager should any of their personal information change (e.g., address, phone number,\nlast name) so the appropriate updates can be made to the files. The Company will take\nreasonable precautions to protect employee files and employees' personally identifiable\ninformation in its records. Employee files are restricted based on who reasonably needs access to all or parts of the\nfiles. Employees may review their own personnel file by making a written request to their\nmanager or Human Resources. The written request will become a part of the employee's\npersonnel file. Review of files must take place in the presence of the employee's manager\nor Human Resources. **E** **MPLOYEE** **R** **EFERENCES**\nAll employee reference check requests should be forwarded to Human Resources; only\nauthorized members of management or Human Resources may provide this information.

Applicable federal and state law defines harassment as unwelcome behavior based\non someone's inclusion in a protected class. Sometimes language or actions that were not\nexpected to be offensive or unwelcome actually are, so employees should err on the side\nof being more sensitive to the feelings of their co-workers rather than less. The following are examples of harassment; behaviors not in this list may also be\nconsidered harassment:\n\n- Unwanted sexual advances;\n- Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;\n- Retaliation or threats of retaliation for refusing advances or requests for favors;\n- Leering, making sexual gestures or jokes, or commenting on an employee's body;\n- Displaying sexually suggestive content;\n- Displaying or sharing derogatory posters, photographs, or drawings;\n- Making derogatory epithets, or slurs;\n- Ongoing teasing about an employee's religious or cultural practices;\n- Ongoing teasing about an employee's sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity;\n- Physical conduct such as touching, assault, or impeding or blocking movements\nSexual harassment on the job is unlawful whether it involves coworker harassment,\nharassment by a manager, or harassment by persons doing business with or for the\nCompany, such as clients, customers or vendors. Retaliation\nAny form of retaliation against someone who has expressed concern about any form of\nharassment, refused to partake in harassing behavior, made a harassment complaint, or\ncooperated in a harassment investigation, is strictly prohibited. A complaint made in good\nfaith will under no circumstances be grounds for disciplinary action. Individuals who make\ncomplaints that they know to be false may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination. ---\n\nEnforcement\nAll managers and supervisors are responsible for:\n\n- Implementing the Company's harassment policy;\n- Ensuring that all employees they supervise have knowledge of and understand theCompany policy;\n\n- Reporting any complaints of misconduct to the designated company representative,the HR Manager, so they may be investigated and resolved internally;\n\n- Taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when necessaryto ensure compliance with the policy; and\n\n- Conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the policy. Addressing Issues Informally\nEmployees who witness offensive behavior in the workplace - whether directed at them\nor another employee - are encouraged, though not required, to immediately address it\nwith the employee whose behavior they found offensive. An employee who is informed\nthat their behavior is or was offensive should stop immediately and refrain from that\nbehavior in the future, regardless of whether they agree that the behavior could have\nbeen offensive. Harassment Complaint Procedure\nEmployees are encouraged to use the Complaint Procedure to report behavior that they\nfeel is harassing, whether or not that behavior is directed at them. The Complaint\nProcedure provides for immediate, thorough, and objective investigation of claims of\nharassment. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against those who are\ndetermined to have engaged in harassing behavior. **A** **BUSIVE** **C** **ONDUCT**\nAbusive conduct means malicious conduct in the workplace that a reasonable person\nwould find hostile or offensive and unrelated to an employer\u2019s legitimate business\ninterests. Abusive conduct may include repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the\nuse of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets, verbal or physical conduct that a\nreasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating, or the sabotage\nor undermining of a person\u2019s work performance.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_O_Neill_Logistics.md", "company": "O Neill Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "O Neill Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_O_Neill_Logistics.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [19737, 25006], "sentence_count": 26, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_O_Neill_Logistics.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_O_Neill_Logistics.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["that", "harassment", "behavior", "work", "company"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "MEAL", "REST"], "hash_64": "21cde8474f72ae33", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.080402", "token_count": 1017}}

Employees may take their complaint\ndirectly to the person or department listed in Step 2 if the complaint is related to their\nsupervisor or manager or if the employee feels the supervisor or manager would not\nprovide an impartial resolution to the problem. Step The complaint should be submitted orally or in writing to a supervisor or manager within\nthree working days of the incident or as soon as possible. Sooner is better, as it will assist\nin a more accurate investigation, but complaints will be taken seriously regardless of\nwhen they are reported. Generally, a meeting will be held within three business days of\nthe employee's request, depending upon scheduling availability. Attempts will be made\nto resolve the issue during the meeting, but regardless of whether there is an immediate\nresolution, the supervisor or manager will give the employee a written summary of the\nmeeting within three business days. Resolution may take longer if further investigation of\nthe complaint is required. If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution, they may\nproceed to Step 2. Step The employee may submit an oral or written request for review of the complaint and Step\n1 resolution to the HR Manager or a designated investigator. This request should be made\nwithin three working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The HR Manager\nor the designated investigator will review the complaint and resolution and may call an\nadditional meeting to explore the problem. If warranted, additional fact-finding will be\nundertaken. A final decision will be rendered within 10 working days after receiving the\nStep 2 request, and a written summary of the resolution will be provided to the employee\nwho filed the complaint. **C** **ORRECTIVE** **A** **CTION**\nA high level of job performance and professionalism is expected from each employee. In\nthe event that an employee\u2019s job performance does not meet the standards established\nfor the position, they violate company policies or procedures, or their behavior is\notherwise unacceptable, corrective action may ensue. Corrective action may include, but\nis not limited to: coaching, oral or written warnings, performance improvement plans,\npaid or unpaid suspension, demotion, and termination.

{"text": "An eligible employee who is a covered servicemember\u2019s spouse, child, parent, or next of\nkin may also take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for\nthe servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to the same job or one\nnearly identical to it with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and\nconditions. Using Leave\nAn employee does not need to use leave in one block. When it is medically necessary or\nthe Company otherwise approves, employees may take leave intermittently or on a\n\n---\n\nreduced schedule. Employees on FMLA leave may be required to report periodically to\nthe Company regarding their status and intent to return to work. An employee who fails\nto return to work at the expiration of the leave without an approved extension will be\nconsidered to have resigned. Employees must inform the Company if the need for leave is for a reason for which FMLA\nleave was previously taken or certified. Employees may choose, or the Company may require, use of accrued paid leave while\ntaking FMLA leave. If an employee substitutes accrued paid leave for FMLA leave, they\nmust comply with the Company\u2019s normal paid leave policies. Employees must give 30 days\u2019 advance notice of the need for FMLA leave. If it is not\npossible to give 30 days\u2019 notice, an employee must notify their manager as soon as\npossible. Documentation\nThe Company may require a certification from a health care provider, and periodic\nrecertification, supporting the need for leave. If certification is requested, employees will\nhave 15 days to provide it. If we determine that the certification is incomplete, we will\nprovide a written notice indicating what additional information is required. Employees do not have to share a medical diagnosis but must provide enough information\nso that the Company can determine if the leave qualifies for FMLA protection. Sufficient\ninformation could include a doctor\u2019s note informing the Company that the employee is or\nwill be unable to perform their job functions, that a family member cannot perform daily\nactivities, or that hospitalization or continuing medical treatment is necessary. If we become aware that an employee\u2019s need for leave is for a reason that may qualify\nunder the FMLA, we will notify the employee if they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if\neligible, provide a notice of rights and responsibilities under the FMLA. If the employee is\nnot eligible, we will provide a reason for ineligibility. The Company will notify employees\nif leave will be designated as FMLA leave, and if so, how much leave will be designated as\nFMLA leave. Benefits\nWhile employees are on FMLA leave, health insurance coverage will continue as if the\nemployees were not on leave. Employees are responsible for their portion of the medical\ninsurance premium cost, if any. Failure to pay the employee portion of the health\ninsurance premiums in advance (or on the schedule established by the payroll\ndepartment) may result in the termination of coverage. If eligible, the employee will\nreceive notification of continuation of benefits. ---\n\nThe Company reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the employee for the\nmedical insurance premiums paid by the Company while the employee was on FMLA\nleave if the employee fails to return from FMLA. The Company will not seek\nreimbursement if the failure to return is due to continuation, recurrence, or onset of a\nserious health condition of the employee or the employee\u2019s family member that would\notherwise qualify for FMLA leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee\u2019s control. The Company will not interfere with an employee\u2019s FMLA rights or retaliate against them\nfor using or trying to use FMLA leave, opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA,\nor being involved in any proceeding under or related to the FMLA. Employees who believe they have not received the benefits to which they are entitled\nunder FMLA are strongly encouraged to speak to another member of management or\nHuman Resources for clarification or resolution. Failing that, an employee is able to file a\ncomplaint with the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, or may bring a\nprivate action.

Employees taking medication should consult a medical professional to determine\nwhether the drug may affect their personal safety or ability to perform their job and\nshould advise their manager of any resulting job limitations. Once notified, the Company\nwill make reasonable efforts to accommodate the limitation. The Company reserves the right to test any employee for the use of illegal drugs,\nmarijuana, or alcohol, in accordance with applicable law. Employees in safety-sensitive\npositions may be subject to regular or random drug testing. Drug or alcohol tests may also\nbe conducted after an accident in which drugs or alcohol could reasonably be involved,\nor when behavior or impairment on the job creates reasonable suspicion of use. Under\nthose circumstances, the employee may be driven to a certified lab for testing at the\nCompany\u2019s expense. Refusal to be tested for drugs or alcohol will be treated the same as\na positive test result. Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination.

In addition, nothing in this policy is\nintended to infringe upon employee rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations\nAct. **S** **OLICITATION AND** **D** **ISTRIBUTION**\nSolicitation during work time and in work areas is prohibited. Solicitation is defined as the\nact of asking for something, selling something, urging someone to do something,\npetitioning, or distributing persuasive materials. This could include, but is not limited to,\nasking for donations for a child's school (including through sales of a product), attempting\nto convert someone to or from a religion, distributing political materials, or collecting\nsignatures. Work time includes time when either the person soliciting, or being solicited\nto, is scheduled to be performing their work duties. Work areas include areas where\nemployees generally do work, such as cubicles, offices, or conference rooms, and does\nnot include areas such as the lunch or break room. ---\n\nThis policy does not prevent employees from using their approved breaks and rest periods\nto solicit outside of working areas and is not intended to infringe an employee's Section\n7 rights. Those not employed by the company are prohibited from solicitation on\ncompany property at all times. **C** **ONFLICT OF** **I** **NTEREST**\nA conflict of interest arises when an employee is engaged in activity that could be\ndetrimental to the company. This includes when an employee improperly uses their\nposition with the company for personal gain or the gain of someone with whom they have\na relationship. *Improper use* includes behavior that is illegal, as well as behavior that is\nunethical or questionable to a reasonable person. These are some examples of a conflict\nof interest:\n\n- An employee requesting or requiring gifts or discounts in exchange for starting orcontinuing a business relationship with a client or vendor\n\n- An employee selecting a relative's company as a supplier when they have notproduced the best proposal\n\n- An employee taking a second job working for a competitor and sharing confidentialcompany information with the competitor\n\n- An employee taking a second job that interferes with their ability to do their workfor the Company at their full potential, whether due to scheduling, exhaustion, or\nsome other factor\n\nBecause how things appear, whether accurate or not, has a significant impact on the\nCompany's reputation, employees should also avoid the appearance of a conflict of\ninterest. If questions arise as to whether a certain activity or behavior is a conflict of\ninterest, employees should speak with their manager or HR. **B** **USINESS** **G** **IFTS**\nEmployees are prohibited from directly or indirectly requesting or accepting a gift for\nthemselves or the company that has a value of $50 or more. If an employee is offered or\ngiven anything of value from any client, prospective client, vendor, or business partner in\nconnection with company business, they should alert their manager immediately. **O** **UTSIDE** **A** **CTIVITIES**\nEmployees may engage in outside employment during non-working hours, provided\ndoing so does not interfere with their job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.

Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and\nthose we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be\nsuccessful in his or her work.

It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0001", "char_span": [5060, 9742], "sentence_count": 22, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0000", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0002", "keywords": ["crouse", "medical", "this", "without", "employees"], "policy_tags": ["ADA"], "hash_64": "3985cd465f366779", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.167732", "token_count": 986}}
{"text": "It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of\nindividuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate\nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,\nadvancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of\nemployment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided\nwithout creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given\nthe same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and\nemployees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the\nrequested accommodations result in the following:\n\n\uf0b7 A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace\nand the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or\n\uf0b7 An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company\nADA policy. ---\n\nThe Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including\nthe resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues. Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation. ##### Employee Classification\n\nEmployees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as\ndetermined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 *Exempt -* Employees who meet any of the FLSA\u2019s exemption standards, including\nmanagerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or\npart-time status. \uf0b7 *Non-Exempt -* Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards. Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these\nemployees. Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their fulltime or part-time status. ##### Employment Resignation and Termination\n\nTermination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons\nfor termination are routine.

Within 14 days of that notification, Human Resources will provide\nenrollment materials to the employee or covered dependent. The covered employee or dependent has 60 days from either the date that coverage would\nordinarily have ended under the plan due to a qualifying event or the date of notification,\nwhichever comes later, to elect continuation of coverage. Election of coverage is established by\ncompleting and returning enrollment materials to Human Resources. COBRA premiums will be billed by the applicable insurance provider. The first premium will be\ndue within 45 days of the date of election. Subsequent premiums must be received within the\nterms set by the provider. Failure to make timely payments will result in termination of coverage\nwithout notice. Continuation coverage will end after 18 months if the qualifying event was a termination or\nreduction in hours, unless the qualified beneficiary is disabled at the time of the qualifying event,\n\n---\n\nin which case coverage may extend to 29 months.

Employees must\nreport any work-related injury or disease immediately (or as soon as practicable) to their\nsupervisor and Human Resources so that the necessary paperwork can be completed in a\ntimely manner. Please note that under state laws, employees who fail to report work-related\ninjuries in a timely manner may see a reduction or denial of their workers\u2019 compensation\nbenefits.

In the event that an employee is able to return to work\nunder restrictions, the company will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the\nemployee\u2019s work ability and job responsibilities. If and when the medical provider removes all\nwork restrictions, the employee is expected to perform his or her regular duties and will no\nlonger receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. FMLA leave and workers\u2019 compensation leave will be applied concurrently when possible. ##### Time Away From Work\n\n##### Bereavement Leave\n\nCrouse Medical Practice has taken into consideration the personal needs that arise from the\ndeath of an immediate family member.

PFL is available for eligible employees to take paid time off from work for the\nfollowing purposes:\n\n\uf0b7 to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child;\n\n---\n\n\uf0b7 to care for a covered family member (including spouses, domestic partners,\nchildren, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren) with a\nserious health condition; or\n\uf0b7 to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active\nmilitary duty. For further information please refer to CMP\u2019s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020. ##### Paid Time Off (PTO)\n\nCrouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away\nfrom work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)\nprogram to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to\ndecide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule. Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:\n\n\uf0b7 As vacation\n\uf0b7 For personal business\n\uf0b7 For periods of illness\n\uf0b7 For religious observation\n\uf0b7 For doctor or dental appointments\n\uf0b7 For personal or family emergencies\n\uf0b7 In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions\n\n##### Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual\n\nAll full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO\nhours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total\namount of PTO time in two equally divided \u201cbuckets\u201d to current employees in the beginning of\nthe first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year. Time allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. - the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):\n\n\uf0b7 Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the\nemployee\u2019s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the\ncompletion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires. \uf0b7 Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an\nexempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If\nthey work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the\nmonth following the date of hire for new hires. When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to\ndetermine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or\nwith less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees\n\n---\n\nmay roll up to forty (40) hours of PTO from one calendar year to the next unless otherwise\nspecified in an employment contract or offer letter. Unless specified otherwise in an employment agreement or offer letter, PTO time is earned as\noutlined in CMP\u2019s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. ##### Personal Leave\n\nCrouse Medical Practice complies with all federal and state leave laws. However, when these\nlaws do not apply or an employee does not meet the eligibility requirements, the company will\nconsider an employee\u2019s request for a personal leave. ##### Time Off to Vote\n\nCrouse Medical Practice encourages all employees to vote. It is the policy of Crouse Medical\nPractice to comply with all state election laws with respect to providing employees time off to\nvote. If an employee has four consecutive hours, either between the opening of the polls in his or her\ncommunity and the beginning of the workday or between the end of the workday and the closing\nof the polls, it will be deemed that the employee has sufficient time outside his or her normal\nworking hours in which to vote. If an employee has less than four consecutive hours in the time periods described above, he or\nshe may take up to two (2) hours of working time to vote. This time is eligible as paid voting\nleave, and such time shall be taken only at the beginning or end of the employee\u2019s workday as\ndesignated by his or her supervisor.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0012", "char_span": [59527, 64068], "sentence_count": 32, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0011", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0013", "keywords": ["time", "hours", "employees", "will", "paid"], "policy_tags": ["PTO"], "hash_64": "39cdfd5f5f22662b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.213945", "token_count": 1022}}

Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee\u2019s religious beliefs, unless such an\naccommodation results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. **DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION**\n\nThe company will consider all requests for disability accommodations to individuals who are otherwise\nqualified to perform the essential functions of a job. When an employee has a need for an accommodation,\nthe employee must let the Human Resources Manager know that an adjustment or a change at work is\nneeded for a reason related to a medical condition. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first\nstep in an informal, interactive process between the employee and the company. The company will make\nan attempt to accommodate the employee\u2019s need for workplace changes with the company\u2019s need to\nmaintain an efficient, productive workplace. Before addressing the merits of the accommodation request, the company will determine if the employee\u2019s\nmedical condition meets the definition of a disability, a prerequisite for the employee to be entitled to a\nreasonable accommodation. The term disability means, with respect to an individual:\n\n- A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of theindividual\n\n- A record of such an impairment; or\n- Being regarded as having such an impairment\nMajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,\nhearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,\nconcentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of a\nmajor bodily function, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth,\ndigestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive\nfunctions. The company may require documentation showing that the employee has a covered disability and stating\nany functional limitations. The documentation must be sufficient to substantiate that the employee has a\ncovered disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested. Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee\u2019s disability, unless such an accommodation\nresults in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. An undue hardship\nwill be based upon an individualized assessment of current circumstances. ---\n\n#### TRAINING\n\n**THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS**\n\nAt each of our restaurants, you will hear repeatedly: Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance,\nProduct Quality and Speed with Service.

The Human Resources\nRepresentative may seek clarification from your health care provider regarding the information contained\non the certification form with your written authorization provided to the company and to your health care\nprovider. The Company reserves the right to request a second and/or third opinion, at the Company\u2019s\nexpense, from a health care provider chosen by the Company. Additionally, a recertification verifying the\nneed for leave may be requested by the Company to support a continuing medical leave every 30 days or\nat the expiration of the minimum duration of the condition, whichever is later. Such recertification can be\nrequested at any reasonable interval but not less than every 30 days unless:\n\n\u25fc\nYou request an extension of leave;\n\n\u25fc\nCircumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly; or\n\n\u25fc\nCompany management receives information that casts doubt on the continuing validity of the most\nrecent certification. In the event that appropriate certification or recertification is not provided, the leave of absence will not be\ngranted or continued, and you will be subject to the company\u2019s policies regarding unexcused absences. Fitness-for-duty certification will be required in order to verify that you are able to return to work. Certification of fitness to return to duty for absences taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave\n\n---\n\nmay be required once every 30 days if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee\u2019s ability to\nperform his or her duties. No second or third opinions will apply for fitness-for-duty certifications. **Qualifying Exigency Certification -** When leave is taken due to a qualifying exigency (e.g., short-notice\ndeployment, military events, financial and legal arrangements, military member\u2019s parental care, etc.) related\nto active duty or a call to active duty for the employee\u2019s spouse, son daughter or parent, the employee\nshould provide a copy of the covered military member\u2019s active-duty orders or other documentation issued\nby the appropriate military branch. The Human Resources Representative may contact the appropriate\nmilitary unit to request verification that a covered military member is on active duty or call to active-duty\nstatus. No recertification requirements will apply to qualifying exigency leaves. **Military Caregiver Certification -** When leave is taken due to a servicemember with a serious illness or\ninjury sustained in the line of duty on active duty who is your spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin,\nthe employee should provide certification completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered\nservicemember or the travel orders issued to the employee on behalf of the servicemember. No\nrecertification requirements will apply to military caregiver leaves. **Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave** - Leave taken because of the serious health condition of either\nyou or a covered family member may be taken on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis if such an\narrangement is certified by the health care provider to be medically necessary or to provide care or\npsychological comfort to a covered relation with a serious health condition, as certified by the health care\nprovider. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may also be taken for a qualifying exigency or for military\ncaregiver leave of absence. An employee who needs an intermittent or reduced work schedule leave must\nattempt to schedule leave so as not to disrupt the Company\u2019s operations.

{"text": "Leave taken due to the birth of a\nchild or placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care must be taken in one consecutive period\nunless approved in advance by the Human Resources Representative. Decisions regarding requests for\nintermittent or reduced work schedule leaves in birth, adoption or foster care situations will be based on the\nbusiness need of the Company. During any period in which you are on an intermittent or reduced work\nschedule, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an alternative position with equivalent pay and\nbenefits that better accommodates the recurring leave. **Designation of Leave** - Once the company has acquired enough information to determine whether the\nleave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason (e.g., after receiving complete and sufficient\ncertification), the Human Resources Representative will provide a designation notice within five business\ndays to the employee stating whether or not FMLA leave has been approved. Additionally, the designation\nnotice will include applicable information regarding amount of leave entitlement, paid/unpaid time off,\nfitness-for-duty certification requirements, certification deficiencies, etc. If a FMLA-qualifying reason is\ndetermined by the Company to exist, the Human Resources Representative may designate leave as FMLA\nwhether the employee specifically requests FMLA designation or not. Employees cannot request that the\nCompany waive an FMLA leave designation if the leave qualifies as a bona-fide FMLA leave. **Notification During the Leave** - You must contact the Restaurant Support Center at least weekly in order\nfor the Company to remain aware of your progress and anticipated longevity of the leave of absence. You\nmust notify the Restaurant Support Center at least two days prior to your expected date of return, or if you\nwill not be able to return when expected.

If you decide to voluntarily terminate employment, the General Manager\nshould be notified as soon as possible. If you fail to return to work on the next workday following the\nexpiration of the leave, you will be deemed to have resigned employment\n**Return From Leave** - When the reason for a family or medical leave ends (for example, a serious health\ncondition no longer exists), you are no longer eligible for leave under this policy and are expected to return\n\n---\n\nto work promptly. When leave is taken due to your own serious health condition, a release from the health\ncare provider will be required prior to your return to work, certifying that you are fit to return to work and\ncan perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodations. You are\nexpected to return to work immediately following the health care provider\u2019s release. **Reinstatement** - This leave provides that you will be able to return to your former position or an equivalent\nposition, with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, if you\nreturn to work within the 12-week period (or 26-week period for military caregiver leave), or at the\nconclusion of the need for the leave. There are limited circumstances in which you may not be reinstated from leave (e.g., in the event\nof a reduction-in-force.) You have no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and\nconditions of employment than if you had not been on FMLA leave. Additionally, employees who are considered \u201ckey employees\u201d under the provisions of the Act may\nbe denied reinstatement if the reinstatement would result in substantial and grievous economic\ninjury to company operations and if the employee was provided the appropriate notice, stating\nsuch, at the commencement of his/her leave. A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible\nemployee who is among the highest paid 10% of the company\u2019s entire workforce within 75 miles\nof the employee\u2019s worksite.

You may also be eligible for state-mandated\ncontinuation rights after COBRA coverage ends. You will receive information about your rights under\nCOBRA upon enrollment in the medical insurance plan. For additional information regarding COBRA or\nto provide notification of a qualifying event for COBRA coverage, contact the Restaurant Support Center. **ON-THE-JOB INJURIES - WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE**\n\nWorkers\u2019 compensation insurance is maintained by the company to provide compensation to employees for\nloss of wages due to injury or illness that occurs in or as a result of employment and also pays necessary\nrelated medical expenses, according to applicable state law. In the State of Texas, you may elect to decline such coverage if, no later than five days after beginning\nemployment, you notify the Human Resources Representative in writing that you wish to retain your\ncommon law right of action. In such an instance, you would not be covered by the insurance plan and\nwould not be able to obtain workers\u2019 compensation income or medical benefits in the event of a job-related\ninjury or accident. If you decline workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, your employment may be\nterminated immediately, as coverage under workers\u2019 compensation insurance is a condition of employment\nwith the company. **All job-related injuries and accidents, regardless of the need for medical attention or severity of the**\n**injury or illness, must be reported immediately to the Manager-In-Charge. Failure to do so may**\n**result in non-payment of medical services. The Manager-In-Charge is responsible for reporting any**\n**work-related accident, illness, or injury immediately to the GM. Failure to comply with B&G**\n**accident reporting procedures can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of**\n**employment.**\n\nThe Company will require an alcohol or drug test if you are involved in a work-related accident. It is expected that all employees are truthful in the reporting of work-related injuries.

{"text": "| |\n| | |\n| The Company values each employee that works with us to serve our customers. As employees under the | |\n| age of 18 comprise a major percentage of our restaurant teams, the Louisiana Minor Break Policy for | |\n| employees less than 18 years old will be strictly enforced. | |\n| | |\n| The Company\u2019s policy is above and beyond Louisiana State Law to assure that our minor employees are | |\n| given the appropriate amount of rest as required by law. | |\n| | |\n| Louisiana State Law requires an uninterrupted 30-minute break after no more than 5 hours. | |\n| | |\n| We cannot accomplish the goal of our Minor Break Policy without each minor employee taking | |\n| responsibility to take his or her breaks according to the policy. Because of the importance of complying | |\n| with the Company and Louisiana State Minor Break requirements the following disciplinary action will | |\n| follow when it comes to our attention that violations have occurred: | |\n| | |\n| - When it comes to our attention that B & G policy is broken, written documentation will be | |\n| recorded and placed in the Minor\u2019s file. Repeated offences may lead to disciplinary action up | |\n| to and including termination. | |\n| - When it comes to our attention that Louisiana State Minor Policy is broken, the minor will be | |\n| terminated immediately. The minor will be eligible for rehire after his or her 18th birthday. | |\n| | |\n| We do not want anyone to be surprised if his/her employment is terminated! Better yet, we do not want | |\n| to lose any of our minors because they did not take this policy seriously. | |\n\n---\n\n**LOUISIANA STATE MINOR VIOLATION POLICY**\n\nAny minor who violates the state\u2019s minor break policy will receive a written warning for his/her first\nviolation. If a minor commits a second state policy violation, he/she will be suspended for one week with\nno pay. If a minor commits a third state policy violation, he/she will be terminated immediately. **Louisiana State Minor Violation Policy regarding GM\u2019s, AGM\u2019s, and Shift Leaders:** If a state minor\nviolation is committed the MIC will receive a written warning and a one-day suspension without pay. If a\nMIC received his/her second minor violation within 30 days of the first they will receive 1 week suspension\nwith no pay. GM\u2019s who are not present at the time a minor violation occurs will receive the following disciplinary action:\n(1) A written warning for the first state violation. (2) If a second state policy is broken within 30 days of\nthe first the GM will be suspended one-day without pay. (3) If a third minor violation is committed within\n60 days of the first violation the GM will be suspended one-week without pay. It is the Area Coach\u2019s\u2019 responsibility to ensure that there are no minor violations in their market. If minor\npolicies are not followed in a market, and if adequate procedures are not implemented and followed, the\nArea Coach will be held responsible. After a written warning, the Area Coach risks being removed for\nrepeated violation. Minors represent a vital part of our operations. Without them it would be next to impossible to run our\nstores, but if we cannot manage this very important \u201cHuman Resource\u201d we will be forced to abandon using\nworkers under the age of 18 because the financial constraints (fines up to $500 per infraction) will leave us\nno alternative. **TAKING A BREAK**\n\nYou are expected to take your breaks in the restaurant lobby only. The Manager-in-Charge will specify the\ntime for breaks. If you are paid on an hourly basis, you are to record your time out for breaks and your time back in upon\nreturn to work. In cases where business volume suddenly increases and the Manager-in-Charge needs help from you while\non break, you are expected to help with the temporary workload. When the increase in volume has been\nhandled, the Manager-in-Charge will allow you to resume the break. If a meal is interrupted, it will be\nreplaced at no charge. (This policy does not include Louisiana Minors who must take an uninterrupted\nbreak.)\n\nIn cases where business volume suddenly decreases, the Manager-in-Charge may ask you to clock out and\nleave the premises. **MEAL POLICY**\n\n*(Discounted meals can be authorized by the Area Coach.)*\n\n**Employee:** Meals for employees are at full price, unless authorized by the Area Coach. If your restaurant\nqualifies for half price meals the following rules apply:\n\n---\n\n- When you are in uniform immediately prior to or immediately after your shift, you may be eligible to\nreceive discounted meals.

You will then be notified of the\n\n---\n\ntermination by the General Manager. Certain actions may result in immediate termination of\nemployment, without prior disciplinary action. **WHEN SUSPENSION BECOMES NECESSARY**\n\nA suspension without pay may be justified when circumstances reasonably require an investigation of a\nserious incident in which you have allegedly been involved. Suspension without pay may be imposed for\nsuch proven misconduct as intentional violation of work or safety rules. **IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM**\n\nWe are committed to treating all employees fairly and honestly. Our success depends upon the results of\nindividual and team efforts, and each employee\u2019s satisfaction with his or her job. You are encouraged to\ntalk to the General Manager or the Manager-in-Charge if a problem arises in the work environment. If the problem is not resolved by the General Manager or Manager-in-Charge, you may ask for a meeting\nwith the Area Coach and/or Director of Operations and General Manager or Manager-in-Charge in an effort\nto work things out. If the problem is still unresolved, you may ask to meet with the President. ---\n\n#### SAFETY\n\n**SECURITY**\n\nThe security of the Company is every employee\u2019s responsibility. The Company takes a very positive\napproach when security matters arise. You should discuss with the Manager-in-Charge and/or the Director\nof Operations any problem which may arise with regard to security. The back door of every restaurant should always have its alarm on and be locked. The back door should\nnever be opened after dark. **Under no circumstances is anyone not working allowed in the restaurant**\n**before or after business hours. This includes off-duty crew, family, and friends. Violation of this**\n**important safety procedure will needlessly endanger the lives of your co-workers and may result in**\n**your immediate termination.**\n\nSecurity policies and devices should not be discussed with anyone outside the Company. You are\nresponsible for understanding and following the Company\u2019s established security procedures. A violation\nof the safety policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Once the lobby is **closed** at night, **never open the door for anyone, including the owner** or any of B &\nG\u2019s Staff, unless they have made prior arrangements. Most robberies occur when employees allow someone\nin after the lobby is locked. **SAFETY IS IMPORTANT**\n\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to provide a safe and healthful workplace. Company safety procedures must be\nfollowed at all times to ensure that crew members and guests enjoy safe restaurant conditions. It is your\nresponsibility to read and understand the safety policies located in each restaurant. The policies cover\ninformation on restaurant equipment, knives, electrical, material handling, storage, employee\nhealth/sanitation, building exterior, severe wind, fires, robbery, and vehicles and driving. The safety policies apply to all employees. You are required to observe all safety rules and procedures,\nproperly use the safety equipment provided as required, practice safety at all times, not create any safety\nhazards, and report all safety hazards to the Manager-in-Charge immediately. You are to observe the safety rules contained in the safety program in every phase of your work. You are\nrequired to participate in the safety effort of the Company by working safely and attending and participating\nin safety sessions when offered. Safety sessions are held every quarter. Incidents involving personnel are\nreviewed on a regular basis to identify any possible safety hazards. If you should have an incident or injury,\nreport it to your Manager-in-Charge immediately **no matter how insignificant it may seem.** If you seek\nmedical attention for a work-related injury, a drug screen is required during the first visit. B&G has\nrecommended medical facilities and are posted in each location. If you use another facility the General\nManager **MUST** be notified immediately. Your particular job requirement may include additional specific\nsafety guidelines which you are required to observe and practice, with no exceptions. | |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Once the lobby is closed at night, never open the door for anyone, including the owner or any of B & |\n| G\u2019s Staff, unless they have made prior arrangements.

Any employee found to be withholding information regarding an alleged employee injury will be subject\nto disciplinary action up to including termination. **ACCIDENTS INVOLVING NON-EMPLOYEES**\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to deal quickly with any accident involving customers, suppliers, or service\npersonnel. The first and most important step is to care for any personal injury involved, and then\nimmediately to report all the relevant information, regardless of how minor the incident may seem at the\ntime to your Area Coach. In all cases, a B & G Incident Reporting Form must be filled out and sent to the\nRestaurant Support Center immediately following the incident for immediate processing with the\nappropriate agency or company. Do not hesitate to call for emergency assistance when necessary or when\nrequested by a non-employee involved in an accident. Any video, witness statements or any other valuable\ninformation should be gathered and placed in a safe and secure place. It should then be given to the AC or\nsent to the Restaurant Support Center. **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**\n\nIn cases of emergency such as power failure, fire, storm damage or robbery, the Manager-in-Charge will\ninstruct employees and others present in the restaurant as to the appropriate course of action (see Employee\nSafety Program). Reference procedures outlined in the Reference Manual and other emergency procedure\noutlines will govern the actions and decisions of the Manager-in-Charge. ---\n\n#### SEPARATION\n\n**SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE US**\n\nThe Company requests that you give two weeks\u2019 notice prior to the effective date of resignation. The\nCompany may permit you to continue employment during the two-week notice period or accept resignation\nimmediately. You will be entitled to receive all earned pay. Earned vacation may be paid for voluntary\nresignations if two weeks\u2019 notice is given and worked. If you do not provide and work through appropriate\nnotice of your resignation, or if your employment is terminated for any reason, you may not receive payment\nfor your accrued vacation. The exception for vacation is for employees in Louisiana who, in accordance\nwith Louisiana state law, will be paid earned, unused vacation time at separation. Unused sick time is\nforfeited. Generally, you will not be rehired if, when resigning, you fail to give the expected notice or fail to work\nout the notice period as agreed upon with your manager. It is the policy of the Company not to rehire a\nformer employee without prior written approval from the Director of Operations and Human Resources. If\nyou are terminated for performance reasons or for misconduct, you will not be eligible for rehire. **JOB ABANDONMENT**\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to consider that an employee who abandons his or her job has voluntarily\nresigned. If you are absent from work for one day or more without proper notification to the Manager-inCharge, you will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. The effective date of terminations will be the\nlast day in which you were actively at work. If you abandon your job, you will be paid only for each day\nactually worked. No earned vacation or sick leave will be paid. The exception regarding vacation pay is\nfor employees in Louisiana who, in accordance with Louisiana state law, will be paid earned, unused\nvacation time at separation. Unused sick leave will not be paid. **TERMINATION PROCEDURES**\n\nOn or before your last day of work, or at any other time when the Company so requests, you must return to\nthe Company any and all memoranda, notes, manuals, and other documents, including all copies of such\ndocuments, in any way relating to the Company or any of its employees, customers, consultants, or\nsuppliers.

You should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. The Handbook describes\nmany of your responsibilities as a team member and outlines the programs we have developed to benefit our\nteam members. One of our objectives at Buchheit is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both\npersonal and professional growth. No team member handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about every one of our policies. Further, there may be situations where the need arises for us to revise, add, or cancel policies. Therefore,\nBuchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The\nonly exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-atwill policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will\nnotify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur. ###### Purpose of Handbook\n\nThe contents of this handbook are not intended to create a contract between Buchheit and any or all of its\nteam members. Rather, this handbook is provided only for the purpose of providing general information\nabout the company and its policies. Buchheit reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change any or all such plans, policies or\nprocedures, in whole or in part, anytime with or without notice. Nothing herein is intended to create any type\nof contract or guarantee of continued employment. Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be\ndiscontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice. ###### The Buchheit Story\n\nIn 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local\nfarmers.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md", "company": "Buchheit Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Buchheit Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [6281, 11554], "sentence_count": 17, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["team", "buchheit", "member", "handbook", "policy"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "FMLA", "HARASSMENT", "MEAL", "OVERTIME", "REST"], "hash_64": "3be3894745636e69", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.853687", "token_count": 1025}}
{"text": "Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be\ndiscontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice. ###### The Buchheit Story\n\nIn 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local\nfarmers. No superhighways, no GPS units - just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family. To make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back\nhome had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy\u2019s efforts were an immediate hit, and\nBuchheit Trucking was born. Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with\na network connecting continents around the globe. The Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores\noffer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest. Yet in spite of our success, we\u2019ve never forgotten the simple principles that drove Rudy back in 1934: get it\nthere on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it \u201c ***Rudy\u2019s way*** .\u201d And no\nmatter how much farther down the road we go, we\u2019ll never lose sight of it. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_9_0.png)\n\n###### Customer Relations\n\nCustomers are Buchheit's most valuable assets. Each team member represents Buchheit to our Customers\nand the public. The way we do our jobs presents an image of our entire organization. Customers judge us by\nhow they are treated each time they have contact with us. Therefore, one of our top business priorities is to\nassist any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,\nand prompt in the attention you give to customers. This applies to internal, as well as external, customers. Buchheit will provide customer relations and services training to all team members who have extensive\ncustomer contact.

A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to\nmake it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself\nhave taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today. I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the\ndepression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant\nloading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education\nduring these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to\nbuy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I\ndid not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25. My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md", "company": "Buchheit Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Buchheit Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0003", "char_span": [11554, 16150], "sentence_count": 41, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0002", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0004", "keywords": ["buchheit", "that", "customer", "make", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "31cbc94f4f634e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.858886", "token_count": 1025}}
{"text": "They trusted that I would pay for it, so I\ndid not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25. My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first\ninventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of\nsalt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk. Later, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they\nwould use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me. They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy. In return, they would fill their baskets with goods they bought from me. Back then, personalized service meant a lot to my customers, as it still does today. Since there was no advertising, the quality of\nservice was the best way to keep my customers loyal. By word of mouth, people began to learn of my business here. In the beginning, I lived in the top of the store. In winter, it would get so cold, the soda bottles would freeze. In the summer, we would\nopen the doors to the stores for a breeze. However, outside was a dirt road, and the dust was so bad, it was almost better to leave the\ndoors shut. I didn't have many employees - one or two. Many days, I would run the cash register, load customers in the yard, and talk to\nsalespeople. Things would get kind of hectic. During the evenings, I would still haul livestock to St. Louis, rent a bed in a rooming\nhouse to sleep for a few hours, and come back home. I worked many 24-hour days. A salesperson would call me every two weeks. I would order my supplies and would have to pay cash for what I needed right then. When people would ask for an item, I would try to get it in stock. By filling my customers' needs, I built my inventory up to a business\nwith a reputation that, \"we have everything you need.\"\n\nIf you have noticed, our emblem is a wagon wheel. This represents how teamwork is necessary for progress. The hub, or the center of\nthe wheel, can be viewed as team members pulling together to get things done, just as the hub holds the spokes together so the wheel\ncan be put into motion. If one spoke is missing, the wheel cannot work. The same is true for our business. If someone does not\ncontribute as a team member, our business cannot work. With teamwork, it is difficult to run a business today; however, without\nteamwork, it is IMPOSSIBLE and will surely fail. The 11 spokes in this wheel represent each of my children. Until the early 1960s, I never took a salary: all the profits went back into the business. I have 11 children. Putting food on the table\noften meant using the outdated groceries from the store. When I think back, it seemed to be pretty hard work at times, and you didn't\nhave much time for yourself. But, I would not have done it if I didn't enjoy it. When my children were big enough to start helping out, they were a big help! With their new ideas, things just seemed to keep\ngrowing. We began to buy a little grain and things in other areas. Our trucking operation expanded to meet our needs, and today, we\nare still servicing our customers with a fleet. The feed division has come a long way from the floral print bags. We now manufacture\nPremium Brand feeds for the surrounding communities and other custom feeds for a distribution network. In running this business, I have learned many things. One is that mistakes will be made. I feel that it is important to correct these\nmistakes as they arise and to take care of our customers. Our family has worked by this motto, which has turned into our business motto:\n\n**Rule #1: The customer is always right.**\n**Rule #2: When in doubt, refer to rule #1.**\n\nNo matter what your job is here at Buchheit, it is very important that you are honest, have a positive attitude, respect the company, and\nrespect the inventory, equipment, and the company's customers. These are the main contributions that make your paycheck possible. I am proud of the history of our company and of the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire Buchheit team.

Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and team members may be asked to\nprovide body substance samples (such as urine, breath, and/or blood) to check for the illicit or illegal use of\ndrugs and alcohol. Drug testing is required as part of the post-offer, pre-employment process. Drug and alcohol testing\nis required for \" *safety-sensitive* \" positions under DOT/FMCSA regulations, and for all team members\nupon reasonable suspicion. A pending positive test result will result in a suspension until final results\nare received. Test results for alcohol or drugs that are positive, or have been tampered with, will\nresult in immediate termination of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing will also result in\ntermination of employment. The cost of any positive drug or alcohol screen will be the responsibility of\nthe team member and will be deducted from the team member's paycheck. Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) can provide confidential counseling and referral services to\nteam members who request assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. We\nconsider it the team member's personal responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP before a\ndisciplinary action is necessitated by problems with the team member's judgment, performance, or\nbehavior. While we support team members, using the EAP to get assistance, that may not prevent\nBuchheit from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all team members. Also, team members will be asked\nto sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy. ###### Team Member Medical Examinations\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/To help us make sure that you are able to perform your duties, Buchheit may require medical\nexaminations or WorkSTEPS testing of all team members.

In this policy, Buchheit is establishing the framework within which\nwe operate. These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further\nclarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the\nCompany President or the Chief Executive Officer. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision\nthat may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with\nBuchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or\nmarriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood\nor marriage. There is no \"presumption of guilt\" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if you have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative\nthat you disclose this fact to an officer of Buchheit as soon as possible. By alerting us to the existence of any\nactual or even a potential conflict of interest, we can establish safeguards to protect all parties. The potential for personal gain is not limited to situations where a team member or relative has a significant\nownership in a firm with which Buchheit does business. Personal gains can also result from situations where\na team member or relative receives a kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of a\ntransaction or business dealings involving Buchheit. Company drivers are not allowed to have direct ownership in over-the-road equipment and are not\nallowed to invest in a company which operates in motor carrier transportation, where the employee has\nany direct or indirect involvement in the operations of such company. ###### Outside Employment\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit team members may hold outside jobs as long as they can satisfactorily perform their Buchheit job\nand there is no interference with our scheduling demands.

Because we believe that recruiting and retaining talented team members is\ncritical to our success, we are committed to paying our team members equitable wages that reflect the\nrequirements and responsibilities of their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly\nsituated team members at the same performance level in other organizations in the area. Compensation for every position is determined by several factors including the essential duties and\nresponsibilities of the job, the team member's performance, and wage survey data on pay practices of other\nemployers. We periodically review our wage administration program and restructure it as necessary. ###### Timekeeping\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Nonexempt team members are responsible for accurately recording the hours they work. This information\nalso helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of \"time worked\" in order\nto correctly calculate team members pay and benefits. \"Time worked\" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties. If you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as\nwell as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for\npersonal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours. Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special\ncircumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device. We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following\nactions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with\ntime records, or recording another team member's time record. If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your\nscheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled\nending time. The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from\nyour supervisor. If corrections or revisions are made to the time record, both the team member and supervisor must approve\nthe changes on the time record as being accurate. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_27_0.png)\n\n###### Paydays\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/All team members are paid biweekly.

Very often you can address these day-to-day issues by politely talking with your co-worker to bring the\nperceived problem to his or her attention. In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate resolution. Buchheit encourages all team members\nto keep an open mind and graciously accept constructive feedback or another team member's request for you\nto change your behavior because it may be affecting that person's ability to concentrate and be productive. The following are some workplace etiquette guidelines and suggestions to help you be more conscientious\nand considerate of your co-workers and the work environment.

When attempting to resolve a problem in person, two company representatives or members of management\nmust be present. ###### Open Door Policy\nAny applicant or employee who believes that there has been a violation of company policy or any applicable\nlaw relating to accommodating a person with a disability should immediately contact the Human Resource\nDepartment. All complaints are promptly investigated. All individuals are expected to cooperate with an\ninvestigation. The information in the course of an investigation is held in confidence and is only disclosed to\nindividuals who have a need to know. ###### Progressive Discipline\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This policy describes the policy for administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory\nconduct at Buchheit. We believe that the best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to be\nenforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all employment levels. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_44_0.png)\n\nWe also believe that it is in the best interests of Buchheit to ensure fair treatment of all team members and\nmake certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any\ndisciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the team member for\nsatisfactory performance in the future. Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to\nterminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive\ndiscipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or\nwithout pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of\noccurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be\nfollowed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;\nanother offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of\nemployment. Buchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify\neither a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual\nprogressive discipline steps. While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee\nConduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or\ntermination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be\nexamples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline. By using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early\nstage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit. ###### Problem Resolution\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for our team members. Part of this\ncommitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or\nquestion receives a timely response from Buchheit supervisors and management. Buchheit strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members. We expect supervisors, managers,\nand team members to treat each other with mutual respect. We encourage team members to offer positive\nand constructive criticism to each other. If you disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, you can express your concern\nthrough the problem resolution procedure. You will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a\ncomplaint with Buchheit in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution\nprocedure. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_45_0.png)\n\nIf a situation occurs when you believe that a condition of employment or a decision affecting you is unjust or\ninequitable, you are encouraged to make use of the following steps.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md", "company": "Buchheit Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Buchheit Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0026", "char_span": [124097, 129225], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0025", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0027", "keywords": ["that", "problem", "team", "buchheit", "progressive"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "REST", "WARN"], "hash_64": "38a5994747674a69", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.954083", "token_count": 1025}}

This\nconfidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment and helps to\nensure everyone's job security. ###### Safety\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This program is a top priority at Buchheit. To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for\nteam members, customers, and visitors, Buchheit has established a workplace safety program. The Loss\nPrevention Department is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety\nprogram. The success of the program depends on the alertness and personal commitment of everyone. We provide information to team members about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal\ncommunication channels. These may include supervisor-team member meetings, bulletin board postings,\nmemos, or other written communications. Team members and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential\nsafety and health hazards, as well as safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. We also have a safety advisory group that assists in these activities and helps facilitate effective\ncommunication between team members and management about workplace safety and health issues. If you have an idea, concern, or suggestion for how to improve safety in the workplace, we encourage you to\ntell your supervisor, location manager, Safety Manager, or the Loss Prevention Manager. We want you to be\nassured that you can report any concerns about workplace safety anonymously if you wish, and you can make\na report without fear of reprisal. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_46_0.png)\n\nYou are expected to obey all safety rules and use caution in your work activities. You must immediately\nreport any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. If you violate Buchheit safety standards, cause a\nhazardous or dangerous situation, or fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, you may be\nsubject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. In the case of an accident that results in an injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, you\nshould immediately notify the Loss Prevention Department or the appropriate supervisor. Prompt reporting\ncan ensure legal compliance and quick initiation of insurance and worker's compensation benefits\nprocedures. A post-accident drug and alcohol screen will be required. ###### Workplace Violence Prevention\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. We\nhave adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual)\nviolence that might occur during business hours or on our premises. All team members, including supervisors and temporary team members, should be treated with courtesy and\nrespect at all times. Team members are expected to refrain from fighting, \"horseplay\", or other conduct that\nmay be dangerous to others. We prohibit firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices and\nsubstances from the premises of Buchheit without proper authorization. Buchheit will not tolerate conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer,\nor a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods.

This policy applies to all employees of the company, including supervisors and non-supervisory\nemployees, and independent contractors. In keeping with this commitment, the company maintains a strict policy prohibiting harassment or\ndiscrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental and/or physical\ndisability, national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law. This includes any form of verbal,\nnon-verbal, physical, and visual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an\nindividual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other\nlegally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. We provide ongoing sexual harassment training to\nensure you the opportunity to work in an environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment. Moreover, it is the policy of the company to prevent and prohibit misconduct on the job, including\nsexual harassment or any other type of harassment or discrimination by co-workers, other employees,\nincluding supervisors, and persons doing business with or for the company. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other offensive conduct of a sexual nature do not\nbelong in the workplace. In addition, a hostile or offensive work environment caused by remarks or actions\nbased on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, gender, age, marital status, veteran status, sexual\norientation, any physical or mental disability or any other classification that is protected under applicable\nlaw, will not be condoned or permitted. Such conduct could constitute harassment, which is not only a\nviolation of Company policy, but also violate the law. It is important to remember that actions or comments you may consider to be innocent or harmless may be\nconsidered offensive physical or verbal harassment by another employee, driver, or contractor. In addition,\nunder some circumstances, a violation of the Company\u2019s E-Mail, Internet, and Mobilecomm Policy may also\nconstitute harassment. If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical\nharassment, or there are other interpersonal issues which compromise the working environment, or which\ncreate discord or distractions that interfere with your safety and productivity, the driver should immediately\nnotify his or her supervisor, or contact the Human Resources Department, so that the company may\ninvestigate the situation.

An aggregation of a series of\nincidents can constitute sexual harassment even if one of the incidents considered on its own would not\nbe harassing. Employees and independent contractors are prohibited from harassing other employees or\nindependent contractors whether or not the incidents of harassment occur on any company premises or\ncompany owned/leased equipment, or customer facilities and whether or not the incidents occur during\nworking hours.

We will generally schedule an exit interview at the time of employment termination. The exit interview is an\nopportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of any outstanding\ndebt to Buchheit, or return of Buchheit-owned property. It is also a time for you to voice any suggestions,\ncomplaints, and questions you may have. Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent,\neither you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause\nor advance notice, at any time. Your benefits are affected by termination in several ways. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and\npayable at termination will be paid out. Some benefits may be continued at your expense if you choose. You\nwill be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations\nfor continuing them. ###### Termination Date\nIf an employee or independent contractor fails to report to work at the normally scheduled time, or a\ndriver abandons a truck, their termination date is the last day they worked.

Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:\n\n- Full-time team members\n- Regular part-time team members\nFull-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in\nthe following schedule:\n\n- After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year. - After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year. - After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year. Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be\neligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the\npreceding two calendar years. The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a \"calendar year\". A \" calendar year\" is defined as\nthe 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended\nfor any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the\nbenefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information. Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the\nschedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued. You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should\nrequest the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will\nbe reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements. Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations\nare granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may\napply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence. Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any\nspecial forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers\nvacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years\u2019 earnings. We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the\nevent that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused\ntime. If your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through\nyour last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements. ---\n\n![(S| BUCHHEIT LOGISTICS MILES BEYOND](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_55_0.png)\n\n**Unpaid Time Off Policy**\nEffective 12/08/All team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment.

Team members are not paid for this absence. Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as\nthe benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave.

Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)\nweeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to\nproperly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be\nwaived in emergency situations. Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and\ncommunicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks\nprior to the requested unpaid time off.

If you are eligible for paid holidays, your holiday pay will be\ncalculated on your straight time pay rate. Holiday hours will be calculated as the following:\n\n- Full time team members working 40 hours a week will receive 8 holiday hours\n- Full time team members working 32 hours a week will receive 6.4 holiday hours\n- Full time team members working 30 hours a week will receive 6 holiday hours\nAlso, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday\nimmediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday. If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or\nvacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have\napplied. If eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday\npay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. A holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team\nmembers. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday. Paid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime. Payment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday. Recognized holidays are:\n\n- New Year's Day (January 1)\n- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)\n- Independence Day (July 4)\n- Labor Day (first Monday in September)\n- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)\n- Christmas (December 25)###### Workers' Compensation Insurance\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Workers\u2019 Compensation provides payment for medical expenses, wage loss, and disability to an\nemployee in the event of an injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires\nmedical, surgical, or hospital treatment.

Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for\nworkers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly. Failure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination. **You must report any injury to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Department within 8 hours**\nNo action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees\u2019 behalf until the Safety Department has been\nnotified. Drivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties\nrequired of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and\nperforming pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal\nvehicle to and from work. Workers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither\nBuchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for\ninjuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or\nathletic activities that we may sponsor. The Safety Department **must** be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The\nCompany will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for\nemergency situations). If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the\nmedical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the\nUnited States. Each Workers\u2019 Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed\ncompensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired. Your weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage. This means the weekly\nbenefits may be significantly less than your net pay. You should also note there is a minimum waiting\nperiod of 3 days (depending on the state Workers\u2019 Compensation laws) before the weekly benefits goes\ninto effect. This translates into a week or two without income. The calculation of your weekly benefit\nand the waiting period is not a policy set by the company but rather by state laws. Your claim may be administered, and benefits paid to you by a third-party administrator. The Company will offer modified duty work to drivers who sustain work injuries if the treating\nphysician feels the driver is capable of modified duty work. Injured drivers will be offered modified\nduty work that will meet their physical capabilities. Modified duty work is intended as rehabilitation and\nshould be temporary only. If your claim is investigated and found to be fraudulent, benefits will be denied, and internal disciplinary\nactions will be taken. If deemed appropriate, legal action may also be taken. A preventable on the job\ninjury may disqualify a driver from the Safety Award program. ---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_58_0.png)\n\nIn the event an injury results in time away from work, drivers will be responsible for making regular\ncontact regarding their status with their supervisor and the Safety Department.

Leave may be taken:\n\n- on the birth of an employee\u2019s child;\n- on the placement of a child for adoption or foster care with an employee;\n- when an employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;or\n\n- when an employee is unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of his or her positionbecause of the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. A \u201cserious health condition\u201d is one that requires inpatient or residential care or continuing treatment by a\nhealth care provider. \u201cContinuing treatment\u201d includes two or more treatments by a health care provider\nfollowed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider. It also\nincludes treatment of pregnancy or prenatal care, treatment of a chronic health condition of a serious nature,\ntreatment of a long-term or permanent health condition for which the family member must be under\ncontinuing supervision of a health care provider, or any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a\nhealth care provider either for restorative surgery or a condition, which if untreated, would result in an\nincapacity of more than three days. For the purpose of this policy, a \"serious health condition\" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or\nphysical or mental condition that involves:\n\n- Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,hospice, or residential medical care facility; or\n\n- A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or any otherregular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health\ncare provider; or\n\n- Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care; or\n- A period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma,diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); or\n\n- Any absences to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by, or onreferral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three\nconsecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md", "company": "Buchheit Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Buchheit Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0037", "char_span": [177800, 182439], "sentence_count": 24, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0036", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0038", "keywords": ["leave", "health", "care", "absence", "medical"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "REST"], "hash_64": "39e79d474b776e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.002433", "token_count": 980}}

III. **Scope:** This policy applies to all family and medical leaves of absence except leaves covered under paid\nemployment benefit plans or polices for any part of the 12 weeks\u2019 leave to which the employees may be\nentitled under this policy. In other words, if an employee is entitled to both FMLA (Family and Medical\nLeave Act) and paid leave under another benefit plan or policy, the employee must take the paid leave\nfirst. IV. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for leave under this policy, an employee must have been employed here for at\nleast 12 months and must have worked at least 1250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the\nbeginning of the leave. While on leave your time vested is protected, and you will not lose any benefits\naccrued prior to the date the leave began (except any accrued paid leave that you are required to exhaust). *Exception:* If an employee on leave is salaried and among the highest paid 10% of Company employees\nwithin 75 surface miles and keeping the job open for the employee would result in substantial and serious\neconomic injury to the Company, the employee can be denied job restoration after leave. In this situation,\nhowever, the employee will be given an opportunity to return to work during leave. V. **Basic Regulations and Conditions of Leave:** Medical certification. The Company will require\nmedical certification to support a claim for leave for an employee\u2019s own serious health condition or to\ncare for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. For the employee\u2019s own medical leave, the certification\nmust include a statement that the employee is unable to perform at least one of the functions of his or her\nposition. For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certification must include an\nestimate of the amount of time that the employee is needed to provide one. Covered employers must take the following steps to provide information to team members about FMLA:\n\n- Post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining rights and responsibilities under FMLA\n- Include information about team member rights and obligations under FMLA in team member handbooksor other written material, including Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs)\n\n- If handbooks or other written materials do not exist, provide general written guidance about team memberrights and obligation under FMLA whenever a team member requests leave\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_64_0.png)\n\n- Provide a written notice designating the leave as FMLA leave and detailing specific expectations andobligations of a team member who is exercising his/her FMLA entitlements.

VII. **Status of Employee Benefits During Leave of Absence:** Health insurance. Group health care\ncoverage will continue for employees on leave as if they were still working. It is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on leave that\nwould normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or before the first day of the\ncoverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the Corporate Payroll\nDepartment. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage. If the leave is paid, premiums will\ncontinue to be paid through payroll deductions.

If the employee fails to return to work at the conclusion of the leave, the Company may require the employee\nto reimburse the full cost of the health care coverage during any period of unpaid leave. VIII. **Procedures:** Employees must contact Corporate Payroll to have FMLA paperwork sent to them.

This form must be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate\nsupervisor for proper approvals, and forwarded to the Human Resources Department (see attached copy of\n\u2018Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence\u2019 form). If possible, the form should be submitted days before the effective date of the leave. All requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness must include sufficient medical\ncertification stating:\n\n(1) the date on which the serious health condition began;\n(2) the probable duration of the condition; and\n(3) the appropriate medical facts that the health care provider knows about the condition. In addition, for leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the\namount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care. For leave for an employee illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform at least\none of the functions of his or her position. For certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave\nschedule for planned medical treatment, the certificate must state the dates on which such treatment is\nexpected to be given and the duration of the treatment.

Buchheit reserves the right to require that a team member provide the company with a\nrecertification of the medical condition for which leave is taken. Before being able to return to work, a team member who is on leave of absence as a result of his or her own\nserious health condition must submit a health care provider's written certification that the team member is\nable to return to work.

If a team member seeks leave on an\nintermittent or reduced schedule basis, the team member must submit medical certification, as discussed\nabove, and additional certification from the health care provider that the intermittent or reduced schedule\nleave is medically necessary. Buchheit may require a team member taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave to transfer temporarily to\nan alternative available position for which the team member is qualified or may modify the team member's\ncurrent position to better accommodate the team member's recurring periods of leave. During the team member's family or medical leave of absence, team members have the option to stop\ncoverage or stop premium payments during the FMLA leave. If the team member elects to continue\ncoverage, Buchheit will continue to provide health insurance coverage; however, the team member will\nremain personally responsible for paying the team member's portion of the insurance premium. Such\npayments may be paid prior to the leave or paid during the leave. Payments must be submitted directly to the\nCorporate Payroll Department. The team member must make similar payments for all other benefits in full\nduring the period leave. A team member who does not return may be required to repay any insurance\npremiums paid by Buchheit during the leave. Team members will be eligible for COBRA benefits at the end\nof their 12-week FMLA leave of absence or the last day payment was received. Upon return from family or medical leave in accordance with this policy, the team member will be returned\nto the same or equivalent position with no loss in benefits, which accrued prior to the leave of absence. A\nteam member who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave will be considered to have\nvoluntarily resigned.

To be eligible to join our 401(k) savings plan, you must be an active\nBuchheit team member. You may join the plan at any time. Eligible team members may participate in the\n401(k)-plan subject to all terms and conditions of the plan. The 401(k) savings plan allows you to elect how much salary you want to contribute and direct the\ninvestment of your plan account, so you can tailor your own retirement package to meet your individual\nneeds. Buchheit also contributes an additional matching amount to each team member's 401(k)\ncontribution, equal to one half of the contribution up to 2% of your gross wages, after the 1st year. Because your contribution to a 401(k) plan is automatically deducted from your pay before federal and state\ntax withholdings are calculated, you save tax dollars now by having your current taxable amount reduced. While the amounts deducted generally will be taxed when they are finally distributed, favorable tax rules\ntypically apply to 401(k) distributions.

The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor\u2019s certificate, to substantiate the\nabsence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or\nwritten reprimand, or termination of employment. Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early\ndepartures as well as absence for an entire day. An employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to\nhave voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY. Employees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records. Employees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log\nout for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business\npurposes as part of their job duties. Tampering with another employee\u2019s time records, including logging another\nemployee in or out, is prohibited and may result in immediate termination. **BULLETIN BOARDS**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY uses bulletin boards to communicate important business information such as safety\nrules, statutory and legal notices, company policies, and management memos. Each employee has the responsibility\nto read the information that is posted. Employees may not post material on bulletin boards without the approval of\nthe Manager. **CONFIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRET**\n\nIt shall be the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to develop procedures for the control, protection and\ndisclosure of all confidential and business information and trade secrets (collectively referred to as confidential\ninformation). All current and former employees of E.N.D JEWELRY are prohibited from disclosing or using\nconfidential information for any purpose including competing with E.N.D JEWELRY, both during their\nemployment, and after their employment relationship at E.N.D JEWELRY has ceased. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, all financial books, records, instruments and\ndocuments; purchase orders; purchase information and inventory; client lists; software programs and codes; reports;\npending proposals; marketing strategies and research; technological data; and any other instruments, records or\ndocuments relating to or pertaining to E.N.D JEWELRY, which was received, reviewed, developed or became\nknown to the employee during their employment at E.N.D JEWELRY. ---\n\nThe failure to comply with this policy by an employee may result in immediate termination and legal action\nto prevent the disclosure or use of the confidential information. Access to confidential information is restricted\nand any employee attempting to access such information for which he or she is not authorized, may be subject to\ndisciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. **DISTRIBUTION OF HANDBILLS, SOLICITATIONS, AND COLLECTIONS**\n\nUnauthorized distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections on the premises by nonemployees is prohibited at all times. Employees are required to report conditions that appear to violate this policy as\nsoon as possible violations are observed. The distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections by employees to other employees are subject to\nthe prior approval of the General Manager. Approved distributions, solicitations, and collections may occur only on\nan employee's own time, may involve only those employees who are also on their own time, and may occur only in\nspecified areas.

This policy\nrestricts certain items and substances from being brought on to or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property,\nincluding its parking areas and its vehicles and prohibits E.N.D JEWELRY employees and all others from reporting\nto work, working or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property, *whether or not on duty* , from being under the\ninfluence of drugs or other substances.

You are also told whether you\nqualify for overtime pay (non-exempt). Unless otherwise specified, the benefits described in this handbook apply only to\nfull-time employees. However, all rules, regulations and policies described in this handbook apply to all employees. Parttime employees are employees who generally work less than a forty (40) hour week. Temporary employees are employees\nwho are hired for a specific project or purpose scheduled to last less than six (6) months. If you are a part-time or temporary\nemployee, you are not eligible for benefits described in this handbook except to the extent required by state and federal laws. **EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE COMPANY**\n\n---\n\nnotification shall include a brief description of the work performed and the approximate number of hours per week devoted\nto it. Nothing in this requirement shall be construed to prohibit such employment, unless it interferes with the\nemployee\u2019s performance of his or her job duties and responsibilities, including scheduling demands, with E.N.D\nJEWELRY, or if the nature of the outside employment is deemed to have a negative impact on E.N.D JEWELRY or\ncreates a conflict of interest. If E.N.D JEWELRY determines that an employee\u2019s outside employment interferes with performance or the\nability to meet the requirements of E.N.D JEWELRY, as may be modified from time to time, or the outside\nemployment is deemed to have a negative impact or creates a conflict of interest, the employee may be asked to\nterminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain employed at E.N.D JEWELRY. **EQUAL EMPLOYMENT**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Equal employment opportunity is not only good\nbusiness, it\u2019s the law and applies to all areas of employment, including recruitment, selection, hiring,\ntraining, transfer, promotion, termination, compensation, and benefits. E.N.D JEWELRY will recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels the most qualified applicants\nwithout regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or veteran status, disability or any other condition\nprotected by state or federal law. Furthermore, E.N.D JEWELRY will make reasonable accommodations for\nqualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. **ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS**\n\nEmployees are expected to use good judgment, adhere to high ethical standards and avoid situations that\ncreate an actual or perceived conflict between their personal interests and those of E.N.D JEWELRY\nrequires that the transactions employees participate in are ethical and within the law, both in letter and in spirit. Employees are expected to not engaged in, directly or indirectly on or off the job, any conduct which is disruptive,\ncompetitive, or damaging to E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that different organizations have different codes of ethics. However, just because a certain action may be acceptable by others outside of E.N.D JEWELRY as \u201cstandard\npractice,\u201d that is by no means sufficient reason to assume that such practice is acceptable at E.N.D JEWELRY. There is no way to develop a comprehensive, detailed set of rules to cover every business situation, therefore this\npolicy is intended to outline some basic guidelines to be followed. Whenever employees are in doubt, they should\nconsult with their manager. ---\n\n**FINAL PAY AND RIGHT OF OFFSET**\n\nIf you resign or are terminated, your final pay, whether by check or direct deposit will be available to you\non the next regularly scheduled payday (unless other arrangements have been made). All Company property must\nbe returned to your Supervisor or the General Manager at the time your final check is released to you. To the extent\nallowed by law, (i) any amounts owing, including for tool purchases, to the Company or the monetary value of\nany unreturned Company property, including Company tools and uniforms will be deducted from the\nemployee's final paycheck; and (ii) any employee who has engaged in misconduct (i.e. intentional or deliberate\nconduct that causes injury, damage or loss to the Company) will have offset from any final check and/or payment of\naccrued but unused vacation, the monetary amount of any injury, damage or loss as determined by the Company. To the extent the final paycheck is not enough to satisfy the amounts owed to the Company by you, you agree to\nimmediately pay such amount or forfeit all tools equal in value to the amount owed to the Company. **FIRE, DISASTER AND OTHER EMERGENCIES**\n\nThe importance of fire and other calamities' prevention cannot be too strongly emphasized.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md", "company": "End Policies Manufacturing", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "End Policies Manufacturing", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [8797, 13636], "sentence_count": 26, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["employees", "jewelry", "that", "outside", "this"], "policy_tags": ["OVERTIME", "REST"], "hash_64": "29cd89474f206e59", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.764578", "token_count": 1002}}

Every employee of E.N.D JEWELRY is responsible for assuring that the work place is free from all forms of\nharassment and discrimination. E.N.D JEWELRY prohibits and will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of\nany employee due to age, race, sex, religion, color, national origin, disability, or on any other basis that would be in\nviolation of any applicable federal, state, or local law. ***Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of verbal, visual or physical conduct that belittles, demeans\nor shows hostility or aversion toward an individual for reasons including, but not limited to his/her gender, race,\nreligion, color, national origin, age, sexual preference or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates,\nand that: \uf0b7 has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment;\n\uf0b7 has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance; or\n\uf0b7 otherwise adversely affects an individual\u2019s employment opportunities. ***Sexual Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual comments, advances, request for\n\nsexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\n\uf0b7 submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s\nemployment;\n\uf0b7 submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions\naffecting such individual; or\n\uf0b7 such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work\nenvironment. Prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or\ncontact to physical contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is offensive or harassing to others. Examples of conduct which could be considered sexual harassment include:\n\n---\n\n\uf0b7 sexually suggestive jokes or gestures directed toward another or sexually oriented or degrading\ncomments about another;\n\uf0b7 preferential treatment of an employee or a promise of preferential treatment to an employee in exchange\nfor dates or sexual conduct, or the denial or threat of denial of employment benefits or advancements for\nrefusal to consent to sexual advances;\n\uf0b7 the open display of sexually oriented pictures, posters, or other material offensive to others; and\n\uf0b7 retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct. All employees are encouraged to express displeasure at any conduct which might be sexually harassing, to\ntell the individual engaging in the conduct that it is unwelcome, and to report the conduct as described in this policy. Occasionally, talking with a supervisor or another employee about the harassment is not sufficient for\nreporting a complaint of harassment. If you feel you are being harassed, you should immediately inform the person\nharassing you that his or her behavior is unwelcome and must stop. You should always promptly report the matter\nto the General Manager. Although, delayed reporting of a complaint could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to\neffectively investigate the complaint, it will not in and of itself preclude the Company from investigating the matter\nand taking appropriate action. If the person you feel is harassing you is General Manager, you should contact the Chief Executive\nOfficer of E.N.D JEWELRY, immediately. E.N.D JEWELRY has no requirement for the form or content of a harassment complaint. Although the\ncomplaint may be verbal, a written statement may be required as part of the investigation to be conducted by E.N.D\nJEWELRY. Allegations of harassment and discrimination are taken very seriously. You have a duty to fully\ncomply with the investigation. You should provide as much information as possible regarding the\noffending incident or conduct, including what happened or is continuing to happen, the person or persons\ncausing the harassment, and the time(s) and place(s) that the incident(s) or conduct occurred. If available,\nthe names of witnesses should be provided, but you should not hesitate to report harassment merely because\nwitnesses are not available or cannot be identified. All complaints will be investigated promptly.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md", "company": "End Policies Manufacturing", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "End Policies Manufacturing", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0003", "char_span": [13636, 18683], "sentence_count": 25, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0002", "next_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0004", "keywords": ["conduct", "that", "sexual", "harassment", "should"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "29edb94557636e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.768911", "token_count": 1015}}

The corrective action may include discipline up to and including termination. The extent and type of\ncorrective action taken may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of the particular\nemployee and the nature of the offense. There will be no retaliation by E.N.D JEWELRY against any employee\nwho makes a good-faith report, even if, after investigation, it appears that there has been no violation.

To receive holiday pay, an eligible employee must be at work, or on an authorized absence, on the work days\nimmediately preceding and immediately following the day on which the holiday is observed. If an employee is absent on\none or both of these days because of an illness or injury, the Company reserves the right to verify the reason for the absence\nbefore approving holiday pay. A holiday that occurs on a Saturday or Sunday may be observed on either the preceding Friday or\nfollowing Monday as determined by E.N.D JEWELRY. If a holiday occurs during an employee\u2019s vacation period, the employee will be given an additional day of paid\nvacation, which may be taken at the beginning or end of the employee\u2019s vacation period, subject to the prior approval of the\nemployee\u2019s supervisor. E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that some employees may wish to observe, as periods of worship or\ncommemoration, certain days which are not included in E.N.D JEWELRY'S holiday schedule. Employees who\nwould like to take a day off for such reasons may be permitted to do so if the employee\u2019s absence from work will\nnot result is an undue hardship in the operation of E.N.D JEWELRY'S business and if prior approval has been\nobtained from the employee\u2019s supervisor.

All applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations pertaining to occupational injuries or illnesses will be followed and\ncomplied with at all times. It is the responsibility of all employees to report immediately to their supervisor all on-the-job injuries or illnesses\nregardless of how insignificant or minor the injury or illness may appear at the time. When employees sustain an injury or illness that requires outside medical treatment, the employees may\nalso be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law\npermits these tests. When employees are involved in a accident that results in significant property damage, the\nemployees may be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system,\nprovided state law permits these tests. Any employee who refuses screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol\nwill be subject to immediate termination. **MAINTENANCE OF WORK AREAS**\n\nIt is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY that work areas are to be kept clean and orderly\n\nAll employees are responsible for maintaining there work areas in a clean and orderly fashion at all times.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md", "company": "End Policies Manufacturing", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "End Policies Manufacturing", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [18683, 23354], "sentence_count": 25, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["will", "employees", "that", "holiday", "employee"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "OVERTIME"], "hash_64": "39ce8c476733ea69", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.773315", "token_count": 962}}
{"text": "**MAINTENANCE OF WORK AREAS**\n\nIt is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY that work areas are to be kept clean and orderly\n\nAll employees are responsible for maintaining there work areas in a clean and orderly fashion at all times. To\nfulfill this responsibility, each employee should, at a minimum, do the following:\n\n\uf0b7 Prior to the end of the work day, clean and organize all tools and equipment and properly secure any\nitems, papers, or information of value; and\n\uf0b7 Place coats, boots, umbrellas, and other items of clothing in designated areas so that work stations are not\nunnecessarily cluttered. Supervisors are responsible for making sure that their employees maintain their work areas in accordance with the\nrequirements of this policy.

Any involvement of a romantic nature between a\nmanager or supervisor and anyone he or she supervises, either directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Violation of this policy\nmay lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination of the management individual involved in the relationship. **OPEN COMMUNICATION**\n\nAt E.N.D JEWELRY, communication is at the heart of good employee relations. Employees should share\ntheir concerns, seek information, provide input, and resolve work-related issues by discussing them with their\nsupervisors until they are fully resolved. It may not be possible to achieve the results an employee wants, but the\nsupervisor needs to attempt to explain in each case why a certain course of action is preferred. If an issue cannot be\nresolved at this level, the employee is welcome to discuss the issue with the Human Resources Manager, General\nManager, or Chief Executive Officer. Regardless of the situation, employees should be able to openly discuss any work-related problems and\nconcerns without fear of retaliation. Managers and supervisors are expected to listen to employee concerns,\nencourage their input, and seek resolution to the issues and concerns. Often this will require setting a meeting in the\nnear future. Managers and supervisors are to set these meetings as quickly as possible, and employees are expected\nto understand that issues and concerns may not always be addressed at the moment they arise. Discussing these\nissues and concerns with management will likely help to find an acceptable solution for nearly every situation. If an employee has a concern about harassment or discrimination, E.N.D JEWELRY has set up special\nprocedures to\nreport and address those issues. The proper reporting procedures are set forth in the Harassment and Discrimination\npolicy. **OVERTIME**\n\nAll overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor and noted on the time reporting system. Holidays, personal leave and other personal absences will not be counted as working hours when computing\novertime pay. Overtime compensation will be one and one-half (1 \u00bd) times the Employee's regular pay rate and will\nnot include any special form of compensation or bonuses. **PAY PERIODS**\n\nEmployees are paid on a Bi-weekly basis every other Friday. Day shift employees will receive their\npaycheck on Friday. Night shift employees will receive their paycheck on Thursday night after 8:00 pm. When such\npayday falls on a holiday or a non-business day, payday will be the preceding business day. If any error\noccurs on your paycheck, notify the General Manager. The error will be corrected as soon as possible.

This will be noted\ndown and addressed immediately. If the refusal relates to a concern about the team member who is carrying out the search (for\nexample, because they are of the opposite gender) then another trained team member\nmay be asked to carry out the search. Refusal to allow a search to continue once any concerns have been addressed may result in\ndisciplinary action. 1. **Frequency of searches**\nThere is no limitation on the number of occasions on which an individual can be searched. 1. **Recording of searches**\nThe team member carrying out the search will be required to make a note in the stop and search\nrecord of every search that is carried out.

{"text": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an\nauthentication method in which a user is granted\naccess only after successfully presenting two or\nmore pieces of evidence to prove their identity. Duo Security is being used to secure MFA enabled\nservices at Western University. ## Why Do I Need This? Passwords alone aren\u2019t enough anymore,\nthat\u2019s why Western is introducing Multi-Factor\nAuthentication (MFA). Passwords can often be\nstolen, guessed, or compromised - you might not\neven know someone is accessing your account. Multi\u2010factor authentication adds a second layer of\nsecurity, keeping your account secure even if your\npassword is compromised. ## How Does It Work? MFA provides you with the best level of security,\nit\u2019s fast and easy to use. When you log into an\nMFA protected site, service or application, such\nas Office 365, you will enter your User ID and\npassword as you normally do and you will use a\nsecondary factor as well. MFA adds a second layer\nof protection by combining something you know\n(your password) with something you have (your\nphone, or security token) to verify your identity. This combination will prevent someone else from\ngaining access to your account, even if they have\ncompromised your password. Once you have set up your Duo Security profile\nyou are ready to go. You will login as usual with\nyour User ID and password, and then use your\ndevice to verify that it\u2019s you. This can be done\nvia SMS, voice call, one time passcode, the Duo\nMobile smartphone app, and so on. ## No mobile phone? You can also use a landline or tablet, or obtain a\nhardware token. Duo lets you link multiple devices\nto your account, so you can use your mobile\nphone and a landline, a landline and a hardware\ntoken, two different mobile devices, etc. # Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\n---\n\n## HAACP\n\nHospitality Services uses a universally recognized\nFood Safety Program called HACCP (Hazard\nAnalysis Critical Control Point). This seven-step\nprogram tracks food products from the farm to\nthe fork, removing all hazards by identifying food\nhazards and critical control points. Your role is to ensure that all products are safely\nhandled from the moment we receive it at\nour loading docks to the point our customers\nconsume it. Careful monitoring, documentation and record\nkeeping are shared responsibilities to ensure we\nkeep our self and customers safe. ## Personal Hygiene\n\nPoor personal hygiene can compromise the\nsafety of our food service establishment. Students\nand Staff can become ill. It is the responsibility\nof all staff members to follow a high standard of\npersonal hygiene which includes daily baths or\nshowers, wearing a clean uniform, retraining hair\nwith a hair net and proper handwashing. ## Handwashing\n\nUnclean hands are the prime culprits in\ntransmitting contaminants to food and there is no\nbetter means of sanitizing hands than frequent\nand through handwashing. **WHEN DO I WAS MY HANDS?**\n\n- Before starting my shift\n- After using the restroom\n\n- After touching face or hair or clothing\n- After sneezing, coughing or blowing nose\n- After handing raw food\n- After eating and taking breaks\n- After smoking\n- After handling dirty dishes\n- After handling garbage\n\n- After handling chemicals\n## Gloves\n\nGloves may be worn at a customer\u2019s request,\nto protect a cut or when handling ready to eat\nfood. Gloves are single use or task only. Gloves\ncan become contaminated just as easily as a\nworker\u2019s hands. They are intended to be changed\nfrequently, never washed but discarded after use. ## Cleaning & Sanitizing\n\n# Working Safely with Food\n\n| | |\n|--|--|\n| | |\n| | |\n\n| | |\n|--|--|\n| | |\n\n---\n\n## Food Holding Temperatures\n\n**Minimize the time food spends in the**\n**temperature danger zone 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) to 140\u00b0F**\n**(60\u00b0C)** .

A food allergy is a medical condition in which one\u2019s\nimmune system mistakenly treats a particular food\nas if it\u2019s dangerous to them. Their body reacts to\nthe food (an allergen) by having an allergic reaction\n- even a small amount of an allergen has the\npotential to cause a reaction. And, unfortunately\nthere is no cure for a food allergy; avoidance is the\nonly way to prevent a reaction. At Western, we house and serve many students\n(staff and/or faculty) with food allergies and\nintolerances. While anaphylaxis (the most severe\ntype of reaction) can lead to death if untreated,\nfatalities can often be avoided. ## Symptoms of an\n## Allergic Reaction\n\nAn allergic reaction\ncan result in any\nof the following\nsymptoms, which\nmay appear alone or\nin any combination,\nregardless of the\ntriggering allergens.

Staff should\nonly assist in administering epinephrine if/\nwhen the person having the reaction is unable\nto do so themselves. 1. **Call 9-1-1 from a campus phone**\n\n2. **Individuals feeling faint or dizzy, should****lie down unless they are vomiting or**\n**experiencing severe respiratory distress**\n**(trouble breathing).**\n\n1. **If there is no improvement in symptoms after****five minutes, a second dose of epinephrine**\n**can be administered by SERT.**\n\n1. **Immediately report the incident** to your UnitManager and/or Supervisor. Education and awareness are key to keeping our\nallergic community safe. Please complete your\nALLERGY AWARE on-line training.

Lunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove\u2019s, a local supermarket back\nin 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store\non Lake Street in Minneapolis. Don Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden\nValley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single\nCompany in 1997. The new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is\nowned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr.\n\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued\nprosperity for the 21st century and beyond. **MEDIA PHILOSOPHY**\nIt is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or\nother public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we\nspeak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a\nCompany-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your\nlocation manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding\nthe media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office. ###### III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES\n\n**EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER**\nOur Company recognizes and values the benefits of diversity in people, ideas and cultures. Accordingly,\nour Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment\nfree from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a\npolicy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender,\nage, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with\nregard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law. ---\n\nThis commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including\nselection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,\nand termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all\nclassifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md", "company": "Lunds Byerlys", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Lunds Byerlys", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [9960, 14796], "sentence_count": 30, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["that", "company", "them", "which", "means"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "38c79c4749674e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.575267", "token_count": 996}}
{"text": "This policy applies to all\nclassifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment. If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or\nprocess that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your\ndepartment manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources. You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal\nemployment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your\ncomplaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be\nengaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up\nto and including separation from employment as determined at management\u2019s discretion. **REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES**\nOur Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting\ndiscrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any\nqualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such\nindividual\u2019s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential\nfunctions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a\nqualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us\naware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her\nposition. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue\nhardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate\ndisclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the\nconfidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information\nis subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at\nmanagement\u2019s discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the\nessential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This\npolicy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions\nnecessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws. **IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE**\nOur Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are\nauthorized to work in the United States. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of\n1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility\nVerification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired with the Company must recertify their employment eligibility by\n\n---\n\ncompleting a new I-9 and provide the appropriate documentation to establish identity and employment\neligibility. Questions about immigration law issues may be directed to the human resource department. **RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE**\nAs part of our strong stand and value set with respect to our EEO, discrimination and harassment\npolicies, all of us have an obligation and duty to be proactive, intervening and addressing any acts that\nmay be potentially offensive or inappropriate particularly from a race and/or religious basis. This\nincludes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or\nclasses of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might\nbe displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by\nreporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It\nalso includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory\nand reporting such to your manager to take action to correct the situation. The key message is: Be proactive and address issues by reporting them to your manager as you see\nthem occur. We all are responsible for providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and\nintolerant acts, while maintaining the highest levels of respect, teamwork and innovation. **RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**\nFor those employees who can provide proof of strongly held religious beliefs, the Company will\nreasonably accommodate religious-based requests with respect to work schedule, breaks, position\nassignment, or other work-related activities provided such requests do not impose an undue hardship\non the work and/or operational needs of the business. You are responsible for informing your manager of the need for such religious-based accommodations in\nwriting.

False and malicious complains of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as opposed to complaints\nthat, even if erroneous, are made in good faith) may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. **EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL**\nAll employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an\nemployment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment\nrelationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you\nas the employee or the Company as your employer at any time, for any reason, with or without cause,\nand with or without notice. No manager or any representative of the Company, other than an officer of\nthe Company, has the authority to enter into any agreement with you for employment for any specified\nperiod, or to make any promises or commitments that are contrary to the employment-at-will policy. Any such agreements entered into by an officer of the Company must be in writing and signed by the\nofficer. **EMPLOYEE REFERRALS**\nWe often find that our own employees are our best source of potential employees and as such we\nappreciate and encourage employee referrals. Our employee referral program provides you with the\nopportunity to earn a bonus (less applicable taxes) for every employee that you refer that becomes\nemployed by the Company. Check with your location manager for specific information regarding the\nreferral program. **EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND ROOMMATES**\nFamily members, significant others, and roommates are a good source of referrals and future\nemployees. All are welcome to apply for and accept employment with the Company. However, to\nreduce the intrusion of domestic relations in our work environment, we ask that immediate family\nmembers, significant others and roommates avoid working in the same department whenever possible,\nand we prohibit family members, significant others and roommates from working in positions where\none is the direct supervisor or manager of the other. When such cases occur, the Company will attempt\naccommodation through transfer, relocation, or job change. In such situations, the affected employees\nwill need to decide which remedy they will select. An exception is made for periods of less than twentynine (29) calendar days where relatives may work together to satisfy short-term, temporary needs of\nthe business. ---\n\n**ETHICSPOINT**\nEthicsPoint is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool for employees to report fraud, abuse and\nother misconduct in the workplace in a completely confidential and anonymous manner.

EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n**STANDARDS OF CONDUCT**\nIt is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect\nthat all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate\nintegrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of\nconduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the\nsafety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive\ndiscipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all\npossible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of\nbehavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship.

You are\nexpected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption\ncaused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in\nadvance of your shift as possible.

If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your\nsupervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment. Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or\nmanager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of\nabsence or disciplinary suspension. ---\n\nFor more information, please review the attendance policy and/or speak with your manager. **Misappropriation of money or propertytheft**\nTaking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is\nforbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be\nconsumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be\nvisible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and\nprosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible. Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not\nworked is considered theft and could cost you your job. **Working off the clock**\nWe value the work that you do and it\u2019s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you\nperform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to\naccurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools\naccurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be\ntolerated and could cost you your job. **Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants**\nYou may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including\ninappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the\njob. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee\nallowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,\nincluding inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants. We encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or\nalcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees\nwho violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for\nassistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked\nto submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of\nalcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including\ntermination of employment. Any such test will be at the Company\u2019s expense and by a physician and/or\ntesting facility selected by the Company and in full compliance with state and federal law. If you are under a physician\u2019s guidance and are taking prescription drugs or other medication which may\naffect your ability to work safely, you should not perform your job duties if doing so will pose a threat to\nyour own safety or the safety of others.

If you work with perishable food, you\u2019ll be asked to learn and demonstrate proper hand-washing\ntechniques, use of food safety gloves, product storage and cooling guidelines, and other procedures. This will ensure that our food products are safe for consumption. This requires 100 percent compliance\nfrom all of us. Please ask your manager if you have any questions about our food safety guidelines. **Hand Washing** **-** Always wash hands with hand soap:\n\uf0b7 Before starting work\n\uf0b7 After using the restroom\n\uf0b7 After smoking, sneezing or coughing into hands\n\uf0b7 After touching yourself or someone else by shaking hands, touching hands, using a tissue, etc. \uf0b7 After handling trash or dirty utensils\n\uf0b7 After handling raw food\n\uf0b7 Before putting on, or whenever changing, disposable gloves\n\n**Not Feeling Well** **-** You\u2019ve probably heard about viruses and other illnesses in the news such as the\nNoroviruses, salmonella, E. coli and hepatitis A.

When you do stretches, you ultimately\ndecrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static\nstretching - which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-seconds - is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as \u201cwarm-ups\u201d\nto those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:\n\n\uf0b7 Head/Neck Roll - Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling. Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times. \uf0b7 Shoulder Shrugs - Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles-up, forward,\ndown and backward. Repeat 3-5 times. \uf0b7 Elbow Press for Middle Back - Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly\nbackward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times. \uf0b7 Back Extension - Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for\nsupport. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times. \uf0b7 Leg Stretches - While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the\nsame with your left leg. Repeat 3-5 times. \uf0b7 Wrist Circles - Slowly rotate hands up, down and around in circles. Repeat 3-5 times. \uf0b7 Ankle Circles - One at a time, rotate ankles in circles. Repeat 3-5 times. Caution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them. **Keeping Your Back Injury-Free** **-** Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from\ninjury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items. Use these safe lifting\ntechniques:\n\uf0b7 Stretch\n\uf0b7 Lift safely\n\uf0b7 Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like ***Shoes For Crews\u00ae***\n- ask your manager about them. \uf0b7 Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs. \uf0b7 Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting. \uf0b7 Know your limits - don\u2019t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for\nhelp; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips. Regular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise\nprogram, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises. **Did You Know?**\n\n\uf0b7 The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe\nlifting techniques. ![Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_40_7](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_40_7.png)\n\n| | Did You Know?", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md", "company": "Lunds Byerlys", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Lunds Byerlys", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0025", "char_span": [123049, 127389], "sentence_count": 46, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0024", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0026", "keywords": ["your", "safe", "repeat", "back", "while"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "19cb3dcf4b6f6770", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.679056", "token_count": 1011}}

Employees are subject to termination at any time, for any reason, with or without\ncause or notice. At the same time, employees may terminate their employment at any time and\nfor any reason. No Company representative is authorized to modify this policy for any employee or to\nenter into any agreement, oral or written, that changes the at-will relationship. **PROBATION PERIOD**\n\nThe first ninety (90) days of employment with Healthcare will be called the Probation\nPeriod. During this time, your supervisor will pay extra attention to your training progress, the\nquality of your work, your attendance/tardiness record, your attitude, and your ability to\ncooperate with co-workers, residents, patients, and visitors. Completion of the Probation Period does not change the employee's status as an at-will\nemployee or in any way restrict the Company's right to terminate the employee or change the\nterms and conditions of employment. ---\n\n**POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION**\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe Company is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated\nwith respect and dignity. This commitment includes a work environment free of unlawful\nharassment and unlawful discrimination. It also includes a work environment free of retaliation\nfor reporting claims of harassment and/or discrimination, or for participating in an investigation of\na complaint of harassment or discrimination. Our policy is to educate employees as to the\nbehaviors that constitute harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination, and to make them\naware of reporting procedures and consequences for those who engage in these prohibited\nbehaviors. Harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated. **Coverage**\n\nThis policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, and prohibits\nharassment, discrimination, retaliation or other unprofessional conduct by or toward all employees\nat all levels of the Company, as well as applicants, unpaid interns, volunteers, independent\ncontractors, temporary workers, vendors, client representatives and other customers. **Individual Employee Liability for Harassment**\n\nAll employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,\nvice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be\nheld personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct. **Workplace Harassment is a Form of Discrimination**\n\nUnlawful harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Please be aware that some state laws may\nprovide for enhanced protection. Unlawful harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person\u2019s legally protected characteristics,\nincluding those listed in this policy where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition\nof continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work\nenvironment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name\ncalling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs,\noffensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance.

If for any reason you will not be able to work a\nscheduled shift, or you will be getting to work late, you must call-in as soon as possible so that your\nsupervisor will have time to try to make adjustments to the schedule. Your supervisor will give you a form with specific instructions about the call-in requirements for\nthe facility you are working in. You must follow those instructions. If you lose that form, or never\nreceived it, be sure to get one from your supervisor. Note that you must talk to your supervisor directly\nas part of your call-in responsibilities. ###### OVERTIME\n\nIn most instances, overtime compensation will be calculated on the basis of the federal law\nrequiring payment on the basis of a 40-hour workweek, with no daily overtime rules. Each work week\nbegins on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday, each week independent of the other for overtime\npay. State laws and collective bargaining agreements may provide for a more favorable lower daily\nthreshold (e.g. over 7.5 hours in a day) or a lower weekly threshold (e.g. 37.5 hours in a workweek)\nrequiring overtime pay. Affected employees must be paid overtime pay based upon the more favorable\ndaily or weekly threshold. The company is not eligible to use the eighty (80) hours worked in a two (2) workweek period\nas a basis for paying overtime. Any collective bargaining agreement citing the eighty (80) hour overtime\nrule must not be used and overtime payments must be based upon the 40-hour workweek rule. ###### REQUESTING, BORROWING, OR ACCEPTING MONEY, TIPS, OR GIFTS FROM\n\n###### PATEINTS/RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS\n\nTo avoid even the appearance of inappropriate conduct, Healthcare strictly prohibits requesting,\nborrowing, or accepting money, tips, or gifts from patients/residents or their family members. ---\n\n###### VACATION\n\nPaid vacation is not accrued.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE**\n\nPursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid\nfamily or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month\nperiod. Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already\ntaken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,\nas described below.

Pregnancy-related disability, pre-natal medical care and childbirth are covered under the\nFMLA. **Qualifying Exigency** . Due to a qualifying exigency as defined in the FMLA final regulations,\n\narising out of the fact that an employee\u2019s parent, child or spouse is on active military duty\nor has been notified of any impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces in\nsupport of a contingency operation as a member of the National Guard or Reserves. Qualifying Exigency Leave is not available to employees whose military family members\nare in the Regular Armed Forces. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain\nmilitary events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal\narrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, attending post-deployment\nreintegration briefings, and other activities associated with the family member\u2019s call or\norder to service.

Employees are required to\nmake reasonable efforts to schedule a foreseeable leave to avoid disruption of Company\noperations, subject to the approval of the appropriate health care provider. If the need for leave is\nnot foreseeable, employees are expected to notify the Company as soon as practicable under the\ncircumstances. Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delaying or denying the leave. An employee requesting Qualifying Exigency Leave should provide as much notice as is\nreasonable and practicable under the circumstances. An employee should submit a written request\nfor Family/Medical Leave of Absence, which includes the anticipated date(s) and duration of the\n\n---\n\nrequested leave. No Family/Medical Leave will be granted without the approval of the Healthcare\nHuman Resources Department. **Certification**\n\nIf a leave is requested because of the employee\u2019s or a covered family member\u2019s serious health\ncondition or to care for a Covered Service member, the employee and the relevant health care\nprovider must supply appropriate medical certification.

If\nthe second health care provider\u2019s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the\nCompany, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct\nan examination and provide a final and binding opinion. The Company also may require medical\nrecertification periodically during the leave and may ask for clarification of any medical\ncertification submitted. Certification also is required for Qualifying Exigency Leave. Certification forms are available\nfrom the Healthcare Human Resources Department. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities\ncovered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or\nfamily member of the individual, *except* as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this\nlaw, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to a request for\nmedical information. \u201cGenetic information,\u201d as defined by GINA, includes an individual\u2019s family\nmedical history, the results of an individual\u2019s or family member\u2019s genetic tests, the fact that an\nindividual or an individual\u2019s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic\ninformation of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual\u2019s family member or an embryo\nlawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services. **Reporting While on Leave**\n\nDuring a Family/Medical Leave, employees may be required to contact their supervisors\nperiodically to report on their status and intention to return to work. **Leave Is Unpaid/Substitution of Paid Leave**\n\nFMLA leave is unpaid leave, except that employees will be required to use any available paid sick\ntime during their leave. The receipt of disability, workers\u2019 compensation, or the substitution of\npaid leave for unpaid leave time does not extend the maximum Family/Medical Leave period. ---\n\n**Medical and Other Benefits**\n\nDuring an approved Family/Medical Leave, the Company will maintain an employee\u2019s group\nhealth benefits as if the employee had continued to be actively employed, for up to a total of weeks (or 26 weeks if Covered Service member Leave is taken) in a 12-month period. If an\nemployee takes more than 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if applicable) of approved Family/Medical Leave\nin a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee\u2019s sole\nexpense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work . If paid leave\nis substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee\u2019s portion\nof the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If the leave is unpaid, an employee\nmust pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease\nfor the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late. If an employee\ndoes not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the\nCompany for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during\nunpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or\nother circumstances beyond the employee\u2019s control. **Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave**\n\nIntermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a\nschedule that reduces an employee\u2019s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday. 1. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as\u201cbaby-bonding\u201d leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually\nagreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be\ntaken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;\n\n1. Leave due to an employee\u2019s own serious health condition, to care for an employee\u2019sspouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service\nmember relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where\nmedically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;\n\n1. Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impendingcall to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an\nintermittent or reduced work schedule. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time\nactually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for\nforeseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the\ntreatment so as to accommodate the Company\u2019s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company\u2019s\noperations.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md", "company": "Healthcare Services Group", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Healthcare Services Group", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0009", "char_span": [43081, 48019], "sentence_count": 26, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0008", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0010", "keywords": ["leave", "health", "employee", "medical", "care"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "FMLA"], "hash_64": "a9c19d4747336e61", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.523771", "token_count": 1012}}

When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned\nmedical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position\nfor which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has\nequivalent pay and benefits. ---\n\n**Returning From Leave**\n\nGenerally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same\nposition or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,\nsubject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to\nreinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the\nFamily/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement\nfollowing Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates\nif an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable\nlaw. If leave is taken because of the employee\u2019s own serious health condition, then the employee must\nprovide medical certification addressing the employee\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions\nof the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will\nnot be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided. **Legal Compliance**\n\nThis policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local\nlaws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this\npolicy. Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,\nwhether or not specifically set forth in this policy. C. ***PERSONAL LEAVE***\n\nEmployees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a\nperiod up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also\nbe requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by\nemployees who need a period of leave due to a \"disability\" within the meaning of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (or similar state law). Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a\nrequest for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the\nCompany will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the\nCompany's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities\nAct (and comparable state laws). An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former\nposition and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions\nof employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal\nLeave will be returned to his or her former position. Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on\na Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health\ninsurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under\nCOBRA, to continue that coverage at their own expense, provided they make timely payments. ---\n\n**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\n\nYour judgment is one of your most valuable assets. You should avoid any activity or\nassociation which conflicts or appears to conflict with your independent judgment and\nHealthcare's best interest. Conflicts can arise in many situations, and it is impossible to cover\nthem all here. In doubtful cases, consult your supervisor before taking any action. These guidelines apply to the most common conflict situations:\n\n1. Do not make investments that might affect your business decisions. 2. Do not accept gifts, loans, or preferential treatment from anyone doing business withHealthcare. 1. Get clearance from the Compliance Officer (at 1-800-523-2248) before doing businesson Healthcare's behalf with any company in which you, or a close family member, may\nbenefit from your actions. 1. Do not work for a supplier, client, or competitor while working for Healthcare or do anywork for a third party that may adversely affect your performance or judgment on the job. 1. Do not become involved in non-company business related interests which require timeduring regular business hours.

If You Abuse A Patient/Resident You May Be Prosecuted\n\nPatients/Residents are to be treated with dignity and respect at all times and under all\ncircumstances. Mistreatment in the form of verbal or physical abuse of any nature will not be\ntolerated. Any employee guilty of abusing a patient/resident is subject to immediate discharge. Local and State authorities will be notified immediately and criminal charges may be filed\nagainst any employee guilty of abuse. Employees found guilty of abuse and/or neglect may be\nfined and/or imprisoned as prescribed by applicable law. If You See Abuse Or Neglect You Must Report It\n\nAny employee who has actual knowledge of the abuse or neglect of a patient/resident\nshall immediately submit a complaint to the employee's supervisor (or if the employee's\nsupervisor is not immediately available, to the Administrator or Nursing Supervisor). Immunity\n\nAny employee reporting abuse or neglect in which they are not involved is immune from\ndiscipline. Any employee making a bad faith, malicious, or reckless report, however, may be\nsubject to discipline by the Company, in addition to possible criminal penalties and/or civil\nliability. ---\n\n**PATIENTS'/RESIDENTS' RIGHTS**\n\nAs a service provider for health care facilities, Healthcare endorses and respects the\npatients'/residents' right to privacy and the protection and preservation of their dignity,\nindividuality, and independence. The facility is the home of the patient/resident and all\nemployees must conduct themselves accordingly. All employees are required to become familiar with, and follow, the patients'/residents'\nrights policy of the facility. Healthcare will provide training on the facility's particular\npatients'/residents' rights policy and procedures. A typical policy provides for, among other\nthings, the following patient/resident rights:\n**Consideration, dignity,** and **respect** in treatment and care. 1. Privacy related to personal care, treatment, visits with family and friends,and\ncommunication. 1. **Use and quite enjoyment of his/her room,** including the right to close the door,and\nretain and use personal clothing and possessions. 1.

Participation in **patient/resident councils** to make complaints andrecommend\nfacility policy changes. 1. Management of the patient's/resident's **own financial affairs.**\n\n2. **Confidentiality** of patient/resident records. ---\n\n**HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND**\n\n**ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)**\n\nHIPAA PRIVACY RULE AS IT RELATES TO OUR SERVICES\n\nThe federal government's HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that Personal Health Information\nabout patients/residents is protected and kept private and secure. Under HIPAA's privacy and\ninformation security section, it is illegal to release health information to inappropriate parties or\nfail to adequately protect Personal Health Information from release. The HIPAA Privacy Rule\napplies to covered entities - most health care providers - including long term care facilities\nand assisted living facilities. Most health care providers do not carry out all their health care activities by themselves. Instead, they often use the services of a variety of other persons and businesses. These other\npersons and businesses are called Business Associates in the HIPAA law. Business Associates\nperform functions on behalf of the health care provider and are bound by the HIPAA Privacy\nRule. From time to time, a Business Associate in performing its duties will come in contact with\nPersonal Health Information. Rules governing the use and disclosure of Personal Health\nInformation apply to Business Associates, as well as health care providers. Healthcare is not a Business Associate when it provides Housekeeping/Laundry/\nMaintenance services. HIPAA specifically excludes entities that provide\nHousekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance services from the law because the work being performed\ndoes not involve the use or disclosure of Personal Health Information. However, since our\nHousekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with\nPersonal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md", "company": "Healthcare Services Group", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Healthcare Services Group", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0011", "char_span": [52967, 58120], "sentence_count": 43, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0010", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0012", "keywords": ["health", "business", "care", "personal", "privacy"], "policy_tags": ["HIPAA", "REST"], "hash_64": "39cfb9474b676e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.531846", "token_count": 1027}}
{"text": "However, since our\nHousekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with\nPersonal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law. Healthcare is a Business Associate when it provides Food Services and is required to\ncomply with HIPAA. Food Service consists of the development of a meal plan that meets the\npatients/residents dietary needs in connection with the over all medical plan developed in\nconjunction with the health care facility. In meeting its responsibilities, Healthcare's Food\nService department on a regular basis comes in contact with residents'/patients' Personal\nHealth Information and must keep this information confidential. The HIPAA Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect individual's medical\nrecords and other Personal Health Information. \uf0b7 It gives patients/residents more control over their health information. \uf0b7 It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records. \uf0b7 It establishes appropriate safeguards that workers in a health care facility\nmust follow to protect the privacy of health information. \uf0b7 It holds violators accountable. ---\n\nViolations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule carry both civil and criminal penalties for \"wrongful\ndisclosure\" that can include fines and jail time in certain circumstances. Failing to protect\nresidents'/patients' information and records by not following our privacy and security policies may\nresult in disciplinary action. What Is Confidential Personal Health Information? Patients/residents expect that only the people who are caring for them will see their health\ninformation and that it will only be used to help care for them. Confidential Personal Health\nInformation includes:\n\n\uf0b7 Patient/Resident Identity\n\n\uf0b7 Address\n\n\uf0b7 Age\n\n\uf0b7 Social Security Number\n\n\uf0b7 Any other personal information that patients/residents are asked to provide. \uf0b7 Diagnosis, treatments, and medications that patients/residents may receive, and other\nobservations about their conditions or past health conditions. The facility collects Personal Health Information so it can care for the patient/resident and\nperform other related functions. Depending upon your job responsibilities, if you do not need to\nknow confidential Personal Health Information, you will not be given access to it. That means that\nyou should not look at medical records, either in the computer or in paper form. There are occasions when you will have access to confidential Personal Health Information. For example, if a patient/resident is placed in isolation, you may become aware of why he/she is\nthere or you may suspect you know why. You may see confidential Personal Health Information\nabout patients/residents in various places throughout the facility. Remember this information is\nconfidential and must not be communicated to anyone else. This information is not to be used by\nyou in any way or told to anyone, including coworkers, other patients/residents, visitors, or anyone\nelse who may ask you about it. ---\n\nWays to Protect Confidentiality\n\n**Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:**\n\n\uf0b7 Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a\nresident's/patient's room. \uf0b7 If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information\nremember to keep it confidential. \uf0b7 If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the\ninformation desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself. \uf0b7 Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your\njob responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential. **Food Service Employees:**\n\n\uf0b7 Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private\nby closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so\nthat others may not overhear them. \uf0b7 Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have\naccess to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public\nareas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor. \uf0b7 Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information\nand are confidential. \uf0b7 Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers\nlogged into resident information while they are not at their workstation. \uf0b7 Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away\nfrom the view of the public or people passing by. \uf0b7 Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it. \uf0b7 Do not store Personal Health Information in common files. \uf0b7 Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the\nfacility. ---\n\nProtecting confidentiality depends on you.

When you do see or hear\ninformation in the course of doing your job, remember that the information is confidential and you\nare not allowed to repeat it or share it with others. This applies even when you no longer work at\nthe facility. Reporting Non-Compliance\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report non-compliance to your immediate supervisor. If you\nfeel that corrective action has not been taken concerning your report, you should contact\nHealthcare's Corporate Compliance Officer at 1-800-523-2248. Employees will not be punished\nfor reporting violations. It is considered part of your job responsibilities to report instances where\nyou suspect that the privacy or confidentiality policies have been broken. **CHEMICAL USE**\n\nLike most jobs, there are possible hazards that you should be aware of before beginning\nemployment. The chemicals that you use are never dangerous when used in their proper dilution\nand for the use for which they are intended. However, if a patient/resident were to swallow a\nchemical, or you were to accidentally spray yourself in the eye, adverse reactions can and will\noccur. Always follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Never use a chemical for something other than for what it is intended. 2. Always make sure that all bottles have proper labels. If not, report it immediately toyour supervisor. 1. Avoid using old bottles for new chemicals. Even though the bottle may appear dry, aresidue of the previous chemical often remains and could cause a chemical reaction. 1. Each housekeeping cart has a lockbox. All chemicals are to be stored in the lockbox.Do not leave your cart unattended. Store it properly while you are on break. 1. If you leave chemicals in the janitor's closets, the door must be locked! 2. NEVER MIX CHEMICALS!!!! ---\n\n**FIRE PROCEDURE AND EVACUATION PLAN**\n\nAs a service provider for health care facilities, Healthcare's employees must be aware of\nthe fire procedure and evacuation plan of the facility in which they work. Employees will be\nrequired to assist facility personnel as instructed. Healthcare will provide training on the\nfacility's particular fire procedure and evacuation plan, including:\n\n1. Location and use of fire extinguishers. 2. Location and operation of the fire alarm system. 3. Patient/resident evacuation procedures and your responsibilities. 4. Notification procedures and actions to be taken if you are the person who locatedthe fire. In the event of a fire:\n\n1. Evacuation of patients/residents from the area comes first. 2. Notification should be made to the designated facility person as soon aspossible after the patients/residents have been evacuated. Be prepared to:\n\n\uf0b7 Identify the location of the fire by room or location. \uf0b7 Describe the size of the fire (large or small) and what is on fire. 1. Never use the word FIRE when notifying facility personnel. Instead, usethe facility's Fire Code (generally a number or color). 1. Locate and use the fire alarm when warranted. 2. Determine whether you can extinguish the fire with the available fireextinguishers and fire blankets. 1. After being notified, the facility will take charge and notify the FireDepartment, Police Department, and Evacuation Center as necessary. 1. The facility will coordinate its evacuation procedures, including your role, if any. ---\n\n**SAFETY AND HEALTH POLICY**\n\nIt is the responsibility, commitment and policy of Healthcare to provide and maintain\nsafe and healthful working conditions throughout our organization. All employees are\nresponsible for complying with safe and healthy work practices. Our system of ensuring that\nall employees are aware of and comply with these practices include the following:\n\n\uf0b7 New employee orientation covering safety and health policies and procedures\n(i.e. Hazard Communications, Bloodborne Pathogen (including Hepatitis B\nvaccination), TB Awareness, Personal Protective Equipment, etc.). \uf0b7 New employee training and routine re-training of existing employees on safety\nand health practices. \uf0b7 On-going evaluation of the safety performance of all employees. \uf0b7 Re-training and disciplining (if necessary) employees for failure to comply with\nsafe and healthful work practices. \uf0b7 Initial and routine facility inspection to identify and evaluate workplace hazards. \uf0b7 Establishing open communications so that all employees are encouraged to\ninform their supervisor of any safety or health hazards. Healthcare will provide comprehensive training to all employees through our inservice programs. Workplace safety and health training is essential, and attendance at these\ntraining sessions is mandatory and must be documented. **IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMS**\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to provide job training to new employees and to\nprovide training on safety and health issues on an on-going basis to all employees. Training\nwill be conducted during regular working hours and employees are required to attend.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md", "company": "Healthcare Services Group", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Healthcare Services Group", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0013", "char_span": [63223, 68162], "sentence_count": 66, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0012", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0014", "keywords": ["employees", "fire", "training", "that", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "3acd9d464f376771", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.540863", "token_count": 1008}}

Training\nwill be conducted during regular working hours and employees are required to attend. In-Service Training programs will be conducted for the following programs, among\nothers:\n\n\uf0b7 Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens\n\n\uf0b7 Hazard Communication Program\n\n\uf0b7 TB Awareness Program\n\n\uf0b7 Personal Protection Equipment\n\n---\n\n**PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT**\n\nAll employees must comply with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act\nregulations. Each employee will be trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment. Employees must follow operating practices that will safeguard all employees, and result in a\nsafe working environment and efficient operation. Any employee who is provided with safety equipment is required to wear such\nequipment at all times when doing the work for which the equipment was provided. **NEEDLE STICK INJURY PROGRAM**\n\nNeedle stick injuries require special handling. Healthcare has engaged Corporate\nWellness, Inc. (\"CWI\") to provide a national program to include an information resource and to\nadminister the program. **If you should incur a needle stick on the job, you need to do the**\n**following to protect yourself:**\n\n1. Immediately notify your supervisor of the incident. 2. Go to the nearest handwashing facility and thoroughly wash the exposed areawith soap and warm water as quickly as possible. 1. Your supervisor will complete a Needle Stick Injury Report and fax itdirectly to CWI. **Needle sticks should be reported within one (1) hour of an incident, whenever**\n**possible. CWI** is available by pager 24-hours per day, seven days a week. After receiving the\nNeedle Stick Injury Report, CWI will contact you and provide you with good, accurate\ninformation about the situation. That information includes:\n\n1. The availability of counseling. 2. The need to be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B, or both. 3. Physician selection options. 4. Treatment options. 5. Risk of infection. 6. Prevention of transmission. 7. Recommended treatments following exposures. ---\n\n**INFECTION CONTROL**\n\nBecause many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and\nare more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as\nsanitary an environment as possible. By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,\nemployees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause\ninfection:\n\n1. Direct contact with infected person. 2. Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person. 3. The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents. 4. Spread through insects. 5. Inoculation. Some Things to Remember:\n\n1. Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of allresident rooms and bathrooms. 1. All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contactwill not do the job. 1. Always dilute properly: too little will be ineffective, too much will be wasteful. 2. Never use a chemical on any surface until you are sure that it is safe for that purpose. 3. Since chemicals are liquid and could be swallowed, all bottles must be labeled withcontents, ingredients, and antidote. 1. No cleaning or working around food while it is being served. 2. Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentationwhich will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution. 1. Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breedinggrounds. 1. Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry. 2. Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination. 3. Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect anycommunicable disease. 1. Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because thedisinfecting agents are still at work on your skin. 1. Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs. ---\n\n**SUBSTANCE ABUSE**\n\nIn order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients\nand a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be\nphysically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. Therefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,\nillegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient\nmanner. No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic\nbeverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in\nCompany vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md", "company": "Healthcare Services Group", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Healthcare Services Group", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0014", "char_span": [68162, 73069], "sentence_count": 75, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0013", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Healthcare_Services_Group.md_chunk_0015", "keywords": ["will", "employees", "must", "that", "safe"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "3bcdfd5643376e51", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.545302", "token_count": 1033}}
{"text": "No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic\nbeverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in\nCompany vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the\nsafety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships\nwith its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ndismissal. Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical\ntreatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to\ntheir supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another\nassignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public. To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever\nmeasures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used\nat, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company\nbelieves them to be justified and necessary. Measures that may be used will include, but not be\nlimited to, searches of people and of personal property located at the workplace, possibly by\nlaw enforcement authorities, as well as drug and/or alcohol tests to be conducted when there is\nreasonable suspicion of substance abuse. In addition, employees who suffer, or contribute to, a\nwork-related accident requiring medical treatment for any employee or facility\npatient/resident, will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing if it is possible that an\nimpaired condition could have contributed to the accident. When urinalysis and/or blood tests are requested or necessary, samples will be taken\nunder the supervision of an appropriate health care professional. The searches and drug tests\nwill not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit\nwill result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination. Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily\nseek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require\nmanagement referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered\nby your medical insurance program. Successful treatment will be viewed positively. However,\nparticipation in a treatment program will not prevent normal disciplinary action for a violation\nwhich may have already occurred, nor will it relieve an employee of the responsibility to\nperform assigned duties in a safe and efficient manner. ---\n\n**WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE**\n\nHealthcare provides a workers' compensation program at no cost to employees for\nany injury, death, or occupational disease arising out of, and in the course of, employment. It is very important that proper procedures be followed by all employees when injured on\nthe job. Although the amount of benefit coverage varies from state to state, the injured employee\nmay receive three basic types of benefits: medical care costs, temporary disability income, and\nrehabilitation costs. **All employees who are injured or ill resulting from a work-related incident must**\n**inform their supervisor immediately.** Supervisors are required to report immediately, or as\nsoon as practical, to their designated Risk Manager - Workers Compensation, all incidents\ninvolving employees under their supervision. **HEALTH/DENTAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION**\n\n**BY EMPLOYEES ON WORKER'S**\n**COMPENSATION OR AN APPROVED LEAVE**\n\n**OF ABSENCE**\n\nAn employee who is covered by the Company's health/dental insurance who is out on\nWorker's Compensation or an approved leave of absence is responsible for reimbursing the\nCompany for the employee deduction (employee's cost) for health/dental insurance during the\nfirst 30 days of absence. If the employee's absence extends past 30 days, the employee will be responsible for the\nfull amount of health/dental insurance premium. If the employee does not pay the monthly\npremium due within 30 days of the date specified in their Notification Letter, the health/dental\ninsurance will be terminated. Eligible employees taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 will\nbe entitled to continue their health/dental insurance coverage for up to 12 weeks of leave,\nprovided the employee makes the required employee-contributions for coverage. Employees\nmust notify their supervisor of this request. The District Manager must communicate the details of an employee's leave to the\nCorporate Benefits Department so that the department may administer the collection of\npayments. ---\n\n**SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION**\n\nIn order to avoid unnecessary annoyances and interruptions during your work,\nsolicitation by an employee of another employee is prohibited while either person is on\nworking time.
