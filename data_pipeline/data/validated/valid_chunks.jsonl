Any time taken\nunder this policy that also qualifies as FMLA or under a state leave law protection, will run concurrent\nwith STD. While STD runs concurrent with FMLA, an employee may have separate instances where\nSTD may qualify. This is not to exceed the maximum allowed STD benefit within the rolling 12-month\nperiod. This benefit only applies to disabilities of the employee, not to disabilities of his/her\ndependents or family members. ---\n\n## Page 32\n\nWhich Employees Are Eligible?

Employees who qualify as administrative, executive, or professional employees within the\nmeaning of the state and federal wage and hour laws are exempt from overtime pay and are not\nsubject to this policy. Because of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the\nCompany requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible. Overtime hours by a non-exempt employee must be approved in advance by an employee\u2019s\nsupervisor. Because unauthorized overtime is against company policy, employees who work\nunauthorized overtime are subject to discipline, possibly including termination. Sick time and\nholiday hours paid but not worked are not included in calculating overtime. Overtime is based only\non actual hours worked as required by law. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee\u2019s regular rate for all hours over\neight hours in one workday or 40 hours in one workweek. Overtime is computed on the basis of a\nnon-exempt employee\u2019s total hours worked in a workday and a workweek. Hours paid for that are\nnot worked (e.g. sick days) do not count as hours worked for overtime purposes. Overtime hours in excess of twelve in one workday are paid at double-time for non-exempt\nemployees. Hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a week are calculated at one and onehalf times the non-exempt employee\u2019s regular rate. Hours worked performed over eight hours on\nthe seventh consecutive day of work also are paid at the non-exempt employee\u2019s double time rate. California Meal and Rest Period Policy\n\nKinyon Construction complies with federal and state legal requirements concerning meal and rest\nperiods. The Company recognizes that employees perform at their best when they have the rest and\nnourishment they need. This policy explains when the Company expects employees to take meal\nand rest periods. Any employee, supervisor, or manager who fails to observe meal and rest period policies will be\nsubject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this policy\nshould be reported to any supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Every report will be\nfully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report\nalleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the Company\u2019s investigation of such reports.

For the purposes of this policy,\nthe leave year is the employee\u2019s anniversary year. Paid sick leave may be used for the diagnosis, care (including preventive care), or treatment of an\nexisting health condition of an employee and certain family members of the employee. A family member includes a child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or\nsibling. For purposes of this policy, a \u201cchild\u201d means a biological or adopted child, a foster child, a\nstep-child, a legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis (in the place of a\nparent). Similarly, a \u201cparent\u201d under this policy means a biological or adoptive parent, a foster\nparent, a step-parent, an employee\u2019s legal guardian, a legal guardian of an employee\u2019s spouse or\ndomestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. Employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking also may use paid\nsick leave for treatment, assistance, and other purposes authorized by law. Employees using paid sick leave must do so in minimum increments of two hours. Employees will\nbe paid for sick leave not later than the payday for the next regular payroll period after the sick\nleave was taken. Finally, an employee will not be required to search for or find a replacement if\nthe employee is taking paid sick leave under this policy. D. Compensation for Sick Leave\n\nPaid sick days ordinarily are paid at the employee\u2019s normal rate of pay earned during regular work\nhours. Accrued, unused paid sick leave is not paid out upon termination or resignation. However,\nemployees separating from employment who are rehired within one year from the date of\nseparation will have their previously accrued and unused paid sick days reinstated. The employee\nalso will begin accruing paid sick leave upon re-hire (assuming the employee\u2019s bank is below the\napplicable cap). In addition, if the employee is re-hired within one year from the date of separation,\nany number of days that the employee previously worked for the Company will be credited toward\nthe 90 calendar days that an employee must have worked for the Company before being eligible\nto use paid sick leave under this policy. E. Approval\n\nIf the need for paid sick leave is foreseeable (e.g., scheduled routine medical appointments), the\nemployee must provide reasonable advance notice. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee\n\nEmployees who reach the applicable cap will cease to accrue further paid sick leave hours until\npaid sick leave is used, at which point the employee will continue to accrue additional paid sick\nleave up to the cap. Paid sick leave not used in a year otherwise carries over from year to year. C.

CODE OF CONDUCT\nDisciplinary Procedure\nAs an at-will employer, the Company may impose discipline whenever it determines it is necessary or\nappropriate. Discipline may take various forms, including verbal counseling, written warnings, suspension,\ndemotion, transfer, reassignment or termination. The discipline imposed will depend on the circumstances of\neach case; therefore, discipline will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover, at any\ntime the Company determines it is appropriate, an employee may be discharged immediately. Every organization must have certain standards of conduct to guide the behavior of employees. Although there\nis no possible way to identify every rule of conduct, the following is an illustrative list (not intended to be\ncomprehensive or to limit the Company\u2019s right to impose discipline for any other conduct it deems\ninappropriate). Keep in mind that these standards of conduct apply to all employees whenever they are on\nCompany property and/or conducting Company business (on or off Company property). Engaging in any conduct\nthe Company deems inappropriate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. a. Dishonesty;\n b. Falsification of Company records;\n c. Unauthorized use or possession of property that belongs to the Company, a coworker, or of the public;\n d. Possession or control of illegal drugs, weapons, explosives, or other dangerous or unauthorized\n materials;\n e. Fighting, engaging in threats of violence or violence, use of vulgar or abusive language, horseplay,\n practical jokes or other disorderly conduct that may endanger others or damage property;\n f. Insubordination, failure to perform assigned duties or failure to comply with the Company\u2019s health,\n safety or other rules;\n g.

There are many ways\nto make this property a safer place:\n\n - Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable,\n do not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the\n person if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say\nsomething like, \"Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need\nhelp, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), \"Are you a guest\nhere?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a\nlegitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better\nto err on the side of caution. - Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. - Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. - Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting\n information about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General\n Manager. - Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may\n offer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor. - Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or\n department. - Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,\n they should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel\n employee. If no answer, they should then crack the door open slightly and repeat their\n identification. - Under no circumstances are any hotel keys to leave the property. - Use of the guest rooms for personal use is strictly prohibited.

Performance Evaluation Process\n The client evaluates the employee job performance on a regular (weekly or monthly) basis using the Customer Quality Card\n provided by the company. As stated on the card, a code or rating of 3 or below is unacceptable. With such rating, the employee\n will undergo additional training and if deemed necessary, terminated. 3. Development Opportunities.

These include:\n\nEssential Duties and Responsibilities\n- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities\n- Dimensional Data\n- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities\n- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job\nresponsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to\nidentify the appropriate career level for the position. Pay Ranges\nEach career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range\nminimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and\nperformance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job\u2019s pay range. The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the\nquality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member\u2019s pay closer\nto the midpoint of the job\u2019s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of\nthe preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career\nlevels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels. The maximum of a salary range represents the highest possible value of the job. Team members generally will not\nreceive increases beyond the maximum of their current job grade.

Newly hired team members are encouraged to discuss an appropriate schedule with their supervisor\nas it may not be practical for them to take all 24 hours in the first calendar year depending on when they are hired. *Volunteer time is intended to provide pay during regularly scheduled work hours and should not be used to provide\nhours beyond the team members budgeted weekly hours. Volunteer time does not carry forward and any unused\nvolunteer time will not be paid at termination. Subject to state workers\u2019 compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the\npayment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member's voluntary participation in\nany off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during\nnormal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program. Work Schedules\n\nWork schedules for team members vary throughout our organization. Staffing needs and operational demands may\nnecessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each\nday and week. Old National may need to occasionally increase or decrease work schedules or hours for business reasons and team\nmembers will be asked to comply with such changes. However, these team members will be given as much advance\nnotice as possible. ---\n\n## Page 15\n\nTEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK 15\n\nAlternative Work Schedules\nIt\u2019s not always easy to create a fit between work schedules with the other responsibilities in our lives.

Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)\nbefore going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it\nis available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot\nguarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance\nOld National provides a comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This\nprogram covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,\nsurgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers\u2019 compensation insurance\nprovides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses. Team members who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. You or your\nsupervisor should then contact HR Shared Services for completion of necessary forms. If treatment is needed, HR\nShared Services can assist you in finding a workers\u2019 comp healthcare provider. No matter how minor an on-the-job\ninjury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible team member to qualify for\ncoverage as quickly as possible. Failure to do so may result in a delay in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Old National\nwill not retaliate against any team member for reporting a work-related injury or illness. MILITARY EXIGENCY LEAVE\n\nOld National provides paid military exigency leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember whose spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty, or are called to covered active-duty status,\nto take leave to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short\nnotice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities. Paid military exigency leave may also\nqualify for FMLA and/or state law protection. Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for\npay purposes. MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE\n\nOld National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (\u201cnearest blood\nrelative\u201d) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state\nlaw protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave\n\nplan design for pay purposes.

However,\nteam members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of\ntheir essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not\notherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or\ncharge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by\nthe employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor\u2019s legal duty to furnish information. Your Conduct\nTo ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members\nto follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this\nsection of the Team Member Handbook, you\u2019ll learn what\u2019s expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the\njob as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. Absenteeism\nAs part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you\u2019re\nnot working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. PLANNED ABSENCES\nYou must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the\nestablished guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or\nbanking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. UNPLANNED ABSENCES\nUnscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from\nyour manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to\nsuffer. If you\u2019re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your\nnormal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM\nOld National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your\nimmediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business\ninterruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a\nmember of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their\nemployment with Old National.

While not an exhaustive list, your manager may consider the impact of your absences on the\ncompletion of work and/or on service levels, the frequency and length of the absences, the reasons for the absences,\nthe timing of your absences, etc. Pay Transparency\n\nOld National will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against team members or applicants because they\nhave inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another team member or applicant. However,\nteam members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of\ntheir essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not\notherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or\ncharge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by\nthe employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish information. Your Conduct\n\nTo ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members\nto follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this\nsection of the Team Member Handbook, you'll learn what's expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the\njob as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. Absenteeism\n\nAs part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you're\nnot working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. PLANNED ABSENCES\n\nYou must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the\nestablished guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or\nbanking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. UNPLANNED ABSENCES\n\nUnscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from\nyour manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to\nsuffer. If you\u2019re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your\nnormal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM\n\nOld National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your\nimmediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business\ninterruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a\nmember of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their\nemployment with Old National. Even if you have paid time off to cover several absences and you report them to your manager in a timely manner, you\nmay be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. Your overall attendance record,\nincluding late arrivals and early departures, is an important consideration when being reviewed for promotional\nopportunities, transfers, and even salary increases. Your manager retains discretion in determining whether your\nabsences are excessive.

The level of performance counseling and corrective action depends on considerations such as:\n+ The nature, circumstances, and severity of the issue(s)\n\n+ - Timing and frequency of previous issues\n\n+ The team member's overall performance\n\nCorrective action options include a verbal, written or final warning, suspension, or termination of employment. Additionally, during the corrective action process, there may be times when Old National determines that it is\nappropriate for you to be out of the workplace, and you may be placed on administrative leave. The Company is\ncommitted to ensuring that performance counseling and corrective action is timely, transparent, and impartial. Because facts and circumstances can vary widely and are often unique to a particular situation, the action that\u2019s\ntaken in one situation shouldn't be interpreted as setting standard for any other situations. Team members are responsible for actively engaging in the corrective action process and taking appropriate action(s)\nto improve their performance or behavior. This may include preparing a plan outlining actions to improve performance,\ncommitments, and follow-up. Old National believes that this corrective action process can help to resolve performance and conduct problems at an\nearly stage. Security Inspections\n\nOld National will maintain a work environment that is free of controlled substances and related paraphernalia, alcohol,\nfirearms, explosives, or other improper materials such as weapons and sexually explicit materials. Old National\nprohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises.

Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer, including off-duty periods, will not\nbe tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's\nsex, race, age, national origin, disability, or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. All threats of violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor. HR Shared Services, and/or the appropriate member of management. You may also contact Corporate Security at 1866-795- 7474 or Security@oldnational.com. This includes threats by team members, as well as threats by customers,\nvendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and\ndetailed as possible. All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place\nyourself in danger. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your workstation, do not try to intercede or see\nwhat is happening. If the situation presented requires attention from Emergency Medical Services, Police, or the Fire\nDepartment, call 911 first. When it is safe and reasonable to do so, notify Corporate Security. Old National will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence, and of suspicious\nindividuals or activities.

Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in violation of these\nguidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Old National encourages team members to bring their disputes or differences with other team members to the\nattention of their supervisors or HR Shared Services before the situation escalates into potential violence.

We believe this\nwill assure a winning combination, for the company, its employees, and also for the customer. We believe in an open-door policy and strive to create an atmosphere where employees are\nencouraged to discuss their problems openly with their superiors, without fear of reprisal, and\nshare their accomplishments with others. Every effort will be made to assure each employee is\nalways respected and treated equitably. VII. Goals:\n\nOur goal is to provide the highest quality service to our customers, at a fair price.

Nature of Employment\n\nThis handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel\npolicies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook,\nfor it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about\nemployment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is\nnot intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is\nbound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship\nat any time. In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A\nreserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in\nthis handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will. The only recognized deviations from\nthe stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A. 102. Employee Relations\n\nJH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are\ncompetitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees\nhave concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice\nthese concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors,\" the\nwork environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding\neffectively to employee concerns. 103.

Conflicts of Interest\n\nEmployees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which JH&A\nwishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction\nso that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable\nstandards of operation.

An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a\ndecision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of JH&A's\nbusiness dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood\nor marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related\nby blood or marriage. No \"presumption of guilt\" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or\nleases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of JH&A as soon as possible the existence\nof any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all\nparties. Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant\nownership in a firm with which JH&A does business, but also when an employee or relative\nreceives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any\ntransaction or business dealings involving JH&A. 109. Outside Employment\n\nEmployees may hold outside jobs as long as they are open and honest about their outside\nemployment with their direct supervisor and meet the performance standards of their job with\nJH&A. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to\nJH&A's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the outside\nrole precedes employment with JH&A, the employee should make the intention to maintain their\noutside position during the application/interview process with JH&A.

Workers' Compensation Insurance\n\nJH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to\nemployees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that\nrequires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment.

Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor\nimmediately.

Workers' Compensation Insurance\n\nJH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to\nemployees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that\nrequires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements,\nworkers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee\nis hospitalized, immediately. Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor\nimmediately.

After 5\ndays, employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired,\nemployees may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits). Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the\nsupervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Employees are expected to\nreport for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the\nemployee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. JH&A will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave. 124. Witness Duty\n\nJH&A encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by JH&A,\nthey will receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty.

JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning\nEmployee Handbook\n\nheating & air conditioning\nsince 1921\nEligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions\nof the agreement between JH&A and the insurance carrier. A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the\nhealth insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) policy\nfor more information. Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An\nSPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible\nemployees. Contact the Administrative Office for more information about health insurance\nbenefits. 129. Timekeeping\n\nAccurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and\nstate laws require JH&A to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee\npay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Hourly nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work,\nas well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the\nbeginning and ending time of any departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must\nalways be approved before it is performed. Time sheets are available in the office. If a specific day's time sheet is not available, employees\nshould inform the office personnel immediately. It is the employee's responsibility to tum in their timecard on a timely basis. Failure to do so could\nresult in a delay of pay. A time sheet must be turned in even when the employee is on vacation, out sick, or taking\npersonal time off. The time sheet should be marked with an explanation of the absence. It is the employee's responsibility to sign their time sheet to certify the accuracy of all time\nrecorded. Office personnel will review the time record for accuracy before payroll processing. If\nan employee has not correctly documented his or her time, corrections will be made in the total\nhours worked, according to the stop and start times recorded. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time\nrecord may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. ---\n\n## Page 27\n\nJACOB Heating & Air Conditioning\nEmployee Handbook\n\n130. Paydays\n\nAll employees are paid weekly. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed\nthrough the end of the previous payroll period. Our payroll period runs from Wednesday to\nTuesday. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a holiday, employees\nwill receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday, unless the office\npersonnel are unable to complete payroll due to unforeseen circumstances. In such case,\nemployees will receive pay on the first day of work after the regularly scheduled payday. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee may receive his or her\nearned wages before departing for vacation if a written request is submitted to the office at least\none week prior to departing for vacation. 131. Employment Terminations\n\nTermination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and\nmany of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common\ncircumstances under which employment is terminated:\n\n - Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee. - Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization. - Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for nondisciplinary reasons. Since employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent, both the employee and JH&A have\nthe right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time. Employees will\nreceive their final pay in accordance with applicable state law. Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner.

Pay Deductions and Setoffs\n\nThe law requires that JH&A make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. JH&A also must deduct Social\nSecurity taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security\n\"wage base.\" JH&A matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee. JH&A offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law. Eligible employees may\nvoluntarily authorize deductions from their pay checks to cover the costs of participation in these\nprograms. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by JH&A, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to JH&A\nor others. Certain pay deductions, such as wage garnishments, credit union and insurance plans, art\ndirected by law and cannot be altered by JH&A.

Safety\n\nTo assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and\nvisitors, JH&A has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for\nJH&A. Management is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating\nthe safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. An M.S.D.S. application (Material Safety Data Sheets) for materials and chemicals used in our\nworkplace is also provided on smart devices in each vehicle. Employees may view the Safety\nProgram Manual or the digital M.S.D.S. sheets at any time, and are responsible for maintaining\naccess via single sign on through the provided application. JH&A provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through\nregular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board\npostings, memos, or other written communications. Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers\npotential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or\nminimize hazards. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns,\nor suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their\nsupervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the President. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who\nfail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment. In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear,\nemployees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor.

The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment:\n\n - Unsafe or negligent operation of company-owned vehicles. - Excessive traffic violations. - Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property\n\n - Falsification of timekeeping records\n\n - Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs\n\n - Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace,\n while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment\n\nJACOB Heating & Air Conditioning\nEmployee Handbook\n\nheating & air conditioning\nsince 1921\n\nThe employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during\nthe leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as AFLAC, dental, and disability\nplans must continue to be paid by the Company in order for the plan to stay in effect. Employees\ntaking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A in such cases. Every effort will be\nmade to keep these supplemental plans in force. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the\nleave and will resume upon return to active employment. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the\nsame position, if itis available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified. However, JH&A cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period,\nJH&A will assume the employee has resigned. Each employee is eligible for bereavement leave of up to 3 business days for direct family\n\n(parents, siblings, grandparents, children). Bereavement leave does not apply to non-direct family\nmembers, and PTO usage would be required for anyone outside of these parameters. 152.

Drug Testing\n\nJH&A is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all\nemployees. Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious\nsafety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants\nand employees may be asked to provide body substance samples (such as urine and/or blood)\nto determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, in a case where a Worker's\nComp claim is submitted, drug or alcohol screening may be required. Refusal to submit to drug\ntesting may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides confidential counseling and referral services\nto employees for assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. It is\n\n---\n\n## Page 51\n\nJACOB Heating & Air Conditioning\nEmployee Handbook\n\nthe employee's responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP prior to reaching a point where his\nor her judgment, performance, or behavior has led to imminent disciplinary action.

The background check may consist of prior employment verification,\nreference checks, education confirmation, criminal background, credit history, or other\ninformation, as permitted by law. Third-party services may be hired to perform these\nchecks. All offers of employment and continued employment are contingent upon a\nsatisfactory background check. Refusal to consent to a background check may result in\ndiscipline, up to or including termination. AT-WILL NOTICE\nThe employment relationship between the Company and employees is at-will. This means\nthat employees are not hired for any specified period of time and their employment may\nbe terminated at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either\nthe Company or the employee.

Sometimes language or actions that were not\nexpected to be offensive or unwelcome actually are, so employees should err on the side\nof being more sensitive to the feelings of their co-workers rather than less. The following are examples of harassment; behaviors not in this list may also be\nconsidered harassment:\n\n. Unwanted sexual advances;\n\n\u00a2 Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;\n\n\u00a2 Retaliation or threats of retaliation for refusing advances or requests for favors;\ne\u00a2 Leering, making sexual gestures or jokes, or commenting on an employee's body;\n*\u00a2 Displaying sexually suggestive content;\n\n* Displaying or sharing derogatory posters, photographs, or drawings;\n\ne Making derogatory epithets, or slurs;\n\n* Ongoing teasing about an employee's religious or cultural practices;\n\n* Ongoing teasing about an employee's sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity;\n*\u00a2 Physical conduct such as touching, assault, or impeding or blocking movements\n\nSexual harassment on the job is unlawful whether it involves coworker harassment,\nharassment by a manager, or harassment by persons doing business with or for the\nCompany, such as clients, customers or vendors. Retaliation\n\nAny form of retaliation against someone who has expressed concern about any form of\nharassment, refused to partake in harassing behavior, made a harassment complaint, or\ncooperated in a harassment investigation, is strictly prohibited. A complaint made in good\nfaith will under no circumstances be grounds for disciplinary action. Individuals who make\ncomplaints that they know to be false may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination. ---\n\n## Page 14\n\nEnforcement\nAll managers and supervisors are responsible for:\n\n- Implementing the Company's harassment policy;\n- Ensuring that all employees they supervise have knowledge of and understand the\n Company policy;\n- Reporting any complaints of misconduct to the designated company representative,\n the HR Manager, so they may be investigated and resolved internally;\n- Taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when necessary\n to ensure compliance with the policy; and\n- Conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the policy. Addressing Issues Informally\nEmployees who witness offensive behavior in the workplace - whether directed at them\nor another employee - are encouraged, though not required, to immediately address it\nwith the employee whose behavior they found offensive. An employee who is informed\nthat their behavior is or was offensive should stop immediately and refrain from that\nbehavior in the future, regardless of whether they agree that the behavior could have\nbeen offensive. Harassment Complaint Procedure\nEmployees are encouraged to use the Complaint Procedure to report behavior that they\nfeel is harassing, whether or not that behavior is directed at them. The Complaint\nProcedure provides for immediate, thorough, and objective investigation of claims of\nharassment. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against those who are\ndetermined to have engaged in harassing behavior. ABUSIVE CONDUCT\nAbusive conduct means malicious conduct in the workplace that a reasonable person\nwould find hostile or offensive and unrelated to an employer\u2019s legitimate business\ninterests. Abusive conduct may include repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the\nuse of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets, verbal or physical conduct that a\nreasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating, or the sabotage\nor undermining of a person\u2019s work performance. A single act will generally not constitute\nabusive conduct, unless especially severe. The Company considers abusive conduct in the workplace unacceptable and will not\ntolerate it under any circumstances. Employees should report abusive conduct to a\nmanager or Human Resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that employees are\nnot subjected to abusive conduct. All reports will be treated seriously and investigated\nwhen appropriate. Employees who are found to have engaged in abusive conduct will be\nsubject to discipline, up to and potentially including termination.

BEREAVEMENT LEAVE\nA regular employee of the Company may request a leave of absence with pay for a\nmaximum of 3 working day(s) upon the death of a member of their immediate family. Members of the immediate family are defined as parents, spouse, domestic partner,\nchild, sibling, grandchild, parent-in-law, and corresponding step-relatives. Proof of the\nneed for leave may be required. The Company reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the employee for the\nmedical insurance premiums paid by the Company while the employee was on FMLA\nleave if the employee fails to return from FMLA. The Company will not seek\nreimbursement if the failure to return is due to continuation, recurrence, or onset of a\nserious health condition of the employee or the employee\u2019s family member that would\notherwise qualify for FMLA leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee\u2019s control. The Company will not interfere with an employee\u2019s FMLA rights or retaliate against them\nfor using or trying to use FMLA leave, opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA,\nor being involved in any proceeding under or related to the FMLA. Employees who believe they have not received the benefits to which they are entitled\nunder FMLA are strongly encouraged to speak to another member of management or\nHuman Resources for clarification or resolution. Failing that, an employee is able to file a\ncomplaint with the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, or may bring a\nprivate action. FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or\nsupersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement that provides greater\nfamily or medical leave rights. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\nRegular full-time employees who have been with the Company for more than six months\nmay request a personal leave of absence without pay. The employee must submit their\nrequest in writing and state the date they would like the leave to begin, the date they\nexpect to return, and the reason for the leave. The Company will consider all factors,\nincluding the necessity of the leave and the impact on business operations, and provide\nwritten approval or denial of the request at its sole discretion. If approved, employees must use their leave of absence for the approved purpose. Sick\nleave, vacation time, seniority and other benefits will not accrue during an unpaid leave\nof absence.

The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:\n\n \uf0b7 Exempt - Employees who meet any of the FLSA\u2019s exemption standards, including\n managerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\n Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or\n part-time status. \uf0b7 Non-Exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards.

If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your\nanticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and\nexempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice\n(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract).

Supervisors will work with employees to develop a break schedule that is reasonable,\naccounts for needs that may vary from day to day, and creates the least amount of disruption to\nthe organizations operations. Crouse Medical Practice will provide a private area, other than a bathroom, for nursing\nemployees to express breast milk. Nursing mothers must request/reserve the room by\ncontacting their direct supervisor. Breaks to express milk will not be paid. In addition to these breaks to express milk, employees\nmay use normal break and lunch periods to accommodate additional nursing needs. For more information, see policy #600-023. If you have any further questions or concerns\nregarding this policy, please contact Human Resources. Paid Family Leave (PFL)\n\nEffective January 1%, 2018, Crouse Medical Practice (CMP) provides Paid Family Leave (PFL)\nto eligible employees pursuant to the New York Paid Family Leave Benefits Law. PFL is available for eligible employees to take paid time off from work for the\n\nfollowing purposes:\ne to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child;\n\n22|Page\n\n---\n\n## Page 29\n\n\uf0b7 to care for a covered family member (including spouses, domestic partners,\n children, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren) with a\n serious health condition; or\n \uf0b7 to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active\n military duty. For further information please refer to CMP\u2019s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020. Paid Time Off (PTO)\n\nCrouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away\nfrom work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)\nprogram to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to\ndecide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule. Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:\n\n \uf0b7 As vacation\n \uf0b7 For personal business\n \uf0b7 For periods of illness\n \uf0b7 For religious observation\n \uf0b7 For doctor or dental appointments\n \uf0b7 For personal or family emergencies\n \uf0b7 In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions\n\nPaid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual\n\nAll full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO.

If they work less than 1\n hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the\n month following the date of hire for new hires. When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to\ndetermine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout.

Employees who want to work more than 40 hours during a workweek must receive authorization\nfrom their supervisor before working overtime. Pay Periods and Check Distribution/Direct Deposit Voucher\n\nThe standard pay period at Crouse Medical Practice consists of two (2), 7-day, 40 hour weeks\nand starts on a Sunday and ends on the second following Saturday. Employees will be paid on\na bi-weekly basis on Friday. If paydays fall on non-workdays or holidays, employees will be paid\non the last workday prior to the regularly scheduled payday. It is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to offer employee's the option to receive payments via\nelectronic direct deposit and/or live payroll check. The payroll office or Human Resources will\nassist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any\nquestions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit. 32|Page\n\n---\n\n## Page 39\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for\nemployees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will\nbe electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated\nby each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or\ncredit unions that support direct deposit. It is each employee\u2019s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal\ninformation and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has\nbeen an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not\nentitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid\namounts from future paychecks. Paychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be\nreleased to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the\nemployee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on\nthe date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or\nshe returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day. If an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to\npayroll information through the Company\u2019s payroll service provider. Performance Evaluation\n\nCrouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,\nabout your job performance. Managers and supervisors are responsible for providing ongoing\nperformance feedback to each employee. In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally\ndiscuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may\nbe conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position. Your performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas\nneeding improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance\nproblems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal\ndiscussions or formal disciplinary action. Formal performance feedback becomes a permanent\npart of your personnel file. Please contact Human Resources if you have any questions.

Therefore,\nBuchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The\nonly exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-atwill policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will\nnotify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur.

No superhighways, no GPS units - just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family. To make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back\nhome had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy\u2019s efforts were an immediate hit, and\nBuchheit Trucking was born. Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with\na network connecting continents around the globe.

Sincerely,\nThe Buchheit Logistics Team\n\n8|P age\n\n---\n\n## Page 10\n\nA Letter from Rudy\n\nI am pleased that you have decided to join us here at Buchheit! A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to\nmake it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself\nhave taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today. I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the\ndepression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant\nloading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education\nduring these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to\nbuy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I\ndid not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25. My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first\ninventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of\nsalt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk. Later, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they\nwould use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me. They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md", "company": "Buchheit Logistics", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Buchheit Logistics", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0005", "char_span": [23101, 27645], "sentence_count": 50, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0004", "next_chunk_id": "Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics.md_chunk_0006", "keywords": ["that", "buchheit", "their", "customer", "they"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "30cf895f5f624771", "created_at": "2025-11-19T13:28:08.187524", "token_count": 1010}}

These\nclassifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Since employment with\nBuchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment\nrelationship at will at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. All team members are in an\nintroductory period during their first 90 days of employment with us. Depending on your position, you are designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state\nwage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT team members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific\nprovisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT team members are excluded from specific provisions of\nfederal and state wage and hour laws. Your EXEMPT and NONEXEMPT classification may be changed\nonly with written notification by Buchheit management. In addition to the Exempt and Nonexempt\ncategories, you also belong to one of the following employment categories:\n\nFULL-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are regularly\nscheduled to work the full-time schedule at Buchheit. Generally, regular full-time team members are eligible\nfor all Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Full-time team members need to work 1,560 hours in a calendar year to maintain their full-time status and\nretain their benefits. REGULAR PART-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are\nregularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule, but at least 1,040 hours in a year. Regular\npart-time team members are eligible for some Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions,\nand limitations of each benefit program. Part-time team members who work more than 1,560 hours in a\ncalendar year will be considered full-time and will be eligible for full-time benefits. PART-TIME team members are team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per\nweek. These team members may be employed in a temporary status. While part-time team members receive\nall legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are\nineligible for the other Buchheit benefit programs. TEMPORARY team members are team members who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily\nsupplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in\nthis category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond the initially stated period does not in any way\nimply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain that status unless, and until, they are\nnotified of a change.

These\nclassifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Since employment with\nBuchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment\nrelationship at will at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. All team members are in an\nintroductory period during their first 90 days of employment with us. Depending on your position, you are designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state\nwage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT team members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific\nprovisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT team members are excluded from specific provisions of\nfederal and state wage and hour laws. Your EXEMPT and NONEXEMPT classification may be changed\nonly with written notification by Buchheit management. In addition to the Exempt and Nonexempt\ncategories, you also belong to one of the following employment categories:\n\nFULL-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are regularly\nscheduled to work the full-time schedule at Buchheit. Generally, regular full-time team members are eligible\nfor all Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Full-time team members need to work 1,560 hours in a calendar year to maintain their full-time status and\nretain their benefits. REGULAR PART-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are\nregularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule, but at least 1,040 hours in a year. Regular\npart-time team members are eligible for some Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions,\nand limitations of each benefit program. Part-time team members who work more than 1,560 hours in a\ncalendar year will be considered full-time and will be eligible for full-time benefits. PART-TIME team members are team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per\nweek. These team members may be employed in a temporary status. While part-time team members receive\nall legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are\nineligible for the other Buchheit benefit programs. TEMPORARY team members are team members who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily\nsupplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in\nthis category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond the initially stated period does not in any way\nimply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain that status unless, and until, they are\nnotified of a change. While temporary team members receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social\nSecurity and workers' compensation insurance), they are ineligible for all other Buchheit benefit programs.

To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and team members may be asked to\nprovide body substance samples (such as urine, breath, and/or blood) to check for the illicit or illegal use of\ndrugs and alcohol. Drug testing is required as part of the post-offer, pre-employment process. Drug and alcohol testing\nis required for safety-sensitive positions under DOT/FMCSA regulations, and for all team members\nupon reasonable suspicion. A pending positive test result will result in a suspension until final results\nare received. Test results for alcohol or drugs that are positive, or have been tampered with, will\nresult in immediate termination of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing will also result in\ntermination of employment. The cost of any positive drug or alcohol screen will be the responsibility of\nthe team member and will be deducted from the team member's paycheck. Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) can provide confidential counseling and referral services to\nteam members who request assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. We\nconsider it the team member's personal responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP before a\ndisciplinary action is necessitated by problems with the team member's judgment, performance, or\nbehavior. While we support team members, using the EAP to get assistance, that may not prevent\nBuchheit from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all team members. Also, team members will be asked\nto sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy.

This information\nalso helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of \"time worked\" in order\nto correctly calculate team members pay and benefits. \"Time worked\" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties. If you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as\nwell as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for\npersonal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours. Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special\ncircumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device. We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following\nactions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with\ntime records, or recording another team member's time record. If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your\nscheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled\nending time. The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from\nyour supervisor. If corrections or revisions are made to the time record, both the team member and supervisor must approve\nthe changes on the time record as being accurate. 25 | P a g e\n\n(S| BUCHHEIT\nLOGISTICS\n\nMILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS\n\nWage Administration\n\nEffective Date: 03/23/2009\nRevision Date: 04/05/2013\n\nThe wage administration program at Buchheit was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with\nfederal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive\nwages within our labor market.

Tf you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as\nwell as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for\npersonal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours. Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special\ncircumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device. We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following\nactions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with\ntime records, or recording another team member's time record. If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your\nscheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled\n\nending time. The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from\nyour supervisor.

The phones are provided to\nassist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other\nbusiness-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,\nbrief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit\nissued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality. Company provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the\nteam member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for\nreplacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being\neligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility\nwindow, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also\nresponsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services. Buchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list\naccessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded\napplications to company provided cell phones. While driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that\nreason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You\nshould utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or\ntalk on the phone. If you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your\nconversations private and non-disruptive to others. The use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited.

The phones are provided to\nassist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other\nbusiness-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,\nbrief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit\nissued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality. Company provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the\nteam member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for\nreplacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being\neligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility\nwindow, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also\nresponsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services. Buchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list\naccessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded\napplications to company provided cell phones. While driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that\nreason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You\nshould utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or\ntalk on the phone. If you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your\nconversations private and non-disruptive to others. The use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited.

Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:\n - Full-time team members\n - Regular part-time team members\n\n Full-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in\n the following schedule:\n- After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year. - After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year. - After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year. Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be\n eligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the\n preceding two calendar years. The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a \"calendar year\". A \" calendar year\" is defined as\n the 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended\n for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the\n benefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information. Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the\n schedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued. You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should\n request the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will\n be reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements. Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations\n are granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may\n apply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence. Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any\n special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers\n vacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years\u2019 earnings. We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the\n event that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused\n time.

It does not include overtime or any\nspecial forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers\nvacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years\u2019 earnings. We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the\nevent that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused\n\ntime. If your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through\nyour last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements. 53|P age\n\n---\n\n## Page 55\n\nUnpaid Time Off Policy\nEffective 12/08/2020\n\nAll team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment. When unpaid time\noff is requested for personal reasons, a team member\u2019s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid\ntime off can be requested. Unpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number\nof consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than\nthree (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave\nof absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence. Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as\nthe benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit\nRetirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and\nemployer contributions to the plan. Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)\nweeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to\nproperly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be\nwaived in emergency situations. Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and\ncommunicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks\nprior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing\nand budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar\nyear. If request is considered excessive more than 10 days in a calendar year the request maybe denied. Requests may be approved or denied on the basis of these or other reasonable considerations.

Because your contribution to a 401(k) plan is automatically deducted from your pay before federal and state\ntax withholdings are calculated, you save tax dollars now by having your current taxable amount reduced. While the amounts deducted generally will be taxed when they are finally distributed, favorable tax rules\ntypically apply to 401(k) distributions.

When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to\ntelephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may\nbe absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin\nwhen they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee\u2019s time\nsheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance\napproval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to\ndiscipline. Upon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the\nreason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor\u2019s certificate, to substantiate the\nabsence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or\nwritten reprimand, or termination of employment. Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early\ndepartures as well as absence for an entire day.

Page 40 of 42\n\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook\n\nStretching and Mini-Breaks - Stretching increases flexibility and helps to promote circulation and range\nof motion while decreasing muscle stiffness and fatigue. When you do stretches, you ultimately\ndecrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static\nstretching - which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-30\nseconds - is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as \u201cwarm-ups\u201d\nto those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:\n\ne Head/Neck Rol! - Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling. Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times. e Shoulder Shrugs - Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles-up, forward,\ndown and backward. Repeat 3-5 times. e Elbow Press for Middle Back - Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly\nbackward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times. e Back Extension - Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for\nsupport. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times. e Leg Stretches - While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the\nsame with your left leg. Repeat 3-5 times. e Wrist Circles - Slowly rotate hands up, down and around in circles. Repeat 3-5 times. e Ankle Circles - One ata time, rotate ankles in circles. Repeat 3-5 times. Caution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them. Did You Know? e The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe\nlifting techniques. Keeping Your Back Injury-Free - Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from\ninjury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items.

In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for\nforeseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the\ntreatment so as to accommodate the Company\u2019s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company\u2019s\noperations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned\nmedical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position\nfor which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has\nequivalent pay and benefits. ---\n\n## Page 20\n\nReturning From Leave\n\nGenerally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same\nposition or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,\nsubject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to\nreinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the\nFamily/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement\nfollowing Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates\nif an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable\nlaw. If leave is taken because of the employee\u2019s own serious health condition, then the employee must\nprovide medical certification addressing the employee\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions\nof the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will\nnot be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided.

Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,\nwhether or not specifically set forth in this policy. C. PERSONAL LEAVE\n\nEmployees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a\nperiod up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also\nbe requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by\nemployees who need a period of leave due to a \"disability\" within the meaning of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (or similar state law).

WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE\n\nHealthcare provides a workers\u2019 compensation program at no cost to employees for\nany injury, death, or occupational disease arising out of, and in the course of, employment. It is very important that proper procedures be followed by all employees when injured on\nthe job. Although the amount of benefit coverage varies from state to state, the injured employee\nmay receive three basic types of benefits: medical care costs, temporary disability income, and\nrehabilitation costs. All employees who are injured or ill resulting from a work-related incident must\ninform their supervisor immediately. Supervisors are required to report immediately, or as\nsoon as practical, to their designated Risk Manager - Workers Compensation, all incidents\ninvolving employees under their supervision. HEALTH/DENTAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION\nBY EMPLOYEES ON WORKER'S\nCOMPENSATION OR AN APPROVED LEAVE\nOF ABSENCE\n\nAn employee who is covered by the Company's health/dental insurance who is out on\nWorker's Compensation or an approved leave of absence is responsible for reimbursing the\nCompany for the employee deduction (employee's cost) for health/dental insurance during the\nfirst 30 days of absence. If the employee's absence extends past 30 days, the employee will be responsible for the\nfull amount of health/dental insurance premium. If the employee does not pay the monthly\npremium due within 30 days of the date specified in their Notification Letter, the health/dental\ninsurance will be terminated. Eligible employees taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 will\nbe entitled to continue their health/dental insurance coverage for up to 12 weeks of leave,\nprovided the employee makes the required employee-contributions for coverage. Employees\nmust notify their supervisor of this request.
