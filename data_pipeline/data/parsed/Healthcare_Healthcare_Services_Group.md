THE COMPANY

      The Company is dedicated to four simple business principles:

        1.      Service. To provide our clients (patients, residents, families, visitors, and
              employees) with the best service possible with a concentration on consistency,
                quality control, and systems operations. Our standardized operation methods are
                 set and never compromised.

        2.      Professionalism. To bring to our industry and our services a professional
               approach. All employees will be professional at all times.

        3.      Cost Efficiency. To operate the department in the most cost-effective manner
                possible. By standardizing operations, maintaining controls, and planning
               schedules, the cost of operations can be controlled.

        4.     Growth. To expand our operations through a satisfied client base and a
               strong management team, preferably developed by promoting from within.





                  EMPLOYMENT AT-WILL

          It is the policy of the Company that all employees are employed at the will of the
Company. Employees are subject to termination at any time, for any reason, with or without
cause or notice. At the same time, employees may terminate their employment at any time and
for any reason.

     No Company representative is authorized to modify this policy for any employee or to
enter into any agreement, oral or written, that changes the at-will relationship.





                     PROBATION PERIOD

      The first ninety (90) days of employment with Healthcare will be called the Probation
Period. During this time, your supervisor will pay extra attention to your training progress, the
quality of your work, your attendance/tardiness record, your attitude, and your ability to
cooperate with co-workers, residents, patients, and visitors.

      Completion of the Probation Period does not change the employee's status as an at-will
employee or in any way restrict the Company's right to terminate the employee or change the
terms and conditions of employment.

POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION

Purpose

The Company is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated
with respect and dignity. This commitment includes a work environment free of unlawful
harassment and unlawful discrimination. It also includes a work environment free of retaliation
for reporting claims of harassment and/or discrimination, or for participating in an investigation of
a complaint of harassment or discrimination. Our policy is to educate employees as to the
behaviors that constitute harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination, and to make them
aware of reporting procedures and consequences for those who engage in these prohibited
behaviors. Harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated.

Coverage

This policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, and prohibits
harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other unprofessional conduct by or toward all employees
at all levels of the Company, as well as applicants, unpaid interns, volunteers, independent
contractors, temporary workers, vendors, client representatives and other customers.

Individual Employee Liability for Harassment

All employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,
vice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be
held personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct.

Workplace Harassment is a Form of Discrimination

Unlawful harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Please be aware that some state laws may
provide for enhanced protection.

Unlawful harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person’s legally protected characteristics,
including those listed in this policy where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition
of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work
environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name
calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs,
offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a
variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:
     The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the
       employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee.
     The victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the
       offensive conduct.
     Unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim.

that  is associated with a national origin group, accent, language use, immigration  status,
citizenship, and other definitions under state laws), ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical
condition, genetic information, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status, union status, or
any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation. It also prohibits

of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of
those characteristics.

This policy prohibits unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical, and visual
harassment. It also prohibits retaliation of any kind against individuals who file complaints of

this policy are subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination.

This policy also strictly prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined as (i) unwelcome sexual
advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature;  (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term

conduct has the purpose or  effect of  substantially  interfering with an  individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual
misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of
authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. Sexual harassment includes many

harassment:

advances, invitation or comments and comments about any employee’s body or clothing, verbal

Complaints, Investigation Procedures, Response and Corrective Action

If you believe that you have been the subject of harassment, discrimination or other prohibited
conduct, or if you learn that another individual covered by this policy may have been the subject of
conduct prohibited under this policy, you should immediately report the situation to the Healthcare
Human Resources Department (via the HR Hotline at 833-HR4-HCSG (833-474-4274) or internal
complaint form found on the HUB) if the individual(s) engaged in the inappropriate conduct is
either your direct supervisor or manager, or another Company supervisor, manager or higher level
employee to whom you do not report. If the individual(s) who engaged in the inappropriate conduct
is your co-worker, you should immediately report the situation to either your supervisor, or if not
comfortable doing so, to the Healthcare Human Resources Department. Your complaint will be taken
very seriously, and you accordingly will be asked to provide details of the incident or incidents, the
names of individual(s) involved, and names of any witnesses.

Upon receiving an oral or written complaint, or information that harassment may have occurred,
the Company will undertake an effective, thorough and objective investigation of the allegations.

During the course of an investigation of the complaint or reported situation, steps may be taken,
when appropriate, to minimize contact between the complaining employee and the alleged
harasser. Such actions may include schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave,
usually for the alleged harasser.

All complaints of harassment and/or discrimination shall be maintained discreetly, consistent with
the disclosure that is necessary to fully, fairly and promptly investigate the complaint or situation
that was reported. Complaints shall be investigated in a fair, timely and thorough manner that
provides all parties appropriate due process, and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the
evidence collected.

If the Company determines that harassment or other prohibited conduct has occurred, effective
remedial action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include
immediate termination of employment, when warranted.

Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee(s), supervisor(s) or manager(s) who attempt
to discourage or prevent any harassment victim, victim of discrimination or retaliation, or witness
to such conduct, from using the Company’s complaint procedure to report the conduct.

If the person who engaged in harassment is not employed by the Company, then the Company will
take whatever corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

Filing of Complaints Outside of Our Company

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and other state and local
agencies investigate, seek to resolve and provide remedies for illegal harassment. Employees may
contact the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000 or www.eeoc.gov. The nearest office of the EEOC or other
agency may be found online or in the local telephone directory.

Prohibition Against Any Form of Retaliation

Acts of retaliation made against an individual who reported sexual harassment or discrimination
are against the law. The Company will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee
or individual who has complained of being a victim of or a witness to harassment or discrimination.
Nor will the Company tolerate retaliation against any employee, independent contractor, intern or
other individual doing business with the Company because the individual participated in the
investigation of a complaint. All individuals should feel free and safe to report claims and
participate as a witness in the investigation of complaints without fear of retaliation of any kind.

If you believe that you have suffered retaliation for making a good faith complaint about
discrimination or harassment, or because you participated as a witness in an investigation of a
complaint,  please immediately  report  the  situation  to  the  Healthcare Human Resources
Department. Any finding of retaliation shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

If there are any questions concerning this policy, please contact the Healthcare Human Resources
Department.

Acceptance of Policy

Everyone at the Company has a personal responsibility to conduct themselves in compliance with
this policy and to report any conduct inconsistent with this policy. If you have any questions
concerning this policy, please contact your immediate supervisor or the Healthcare Human

If the person who engaged in harassment is not employed by the Company, then the Company will
take whatever corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

Filing of Complaints Outside of Our Company

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and other state and local
agencies investigate, seek to resolve and provide remedies for illegal harassment. Employees may
contact the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000 or www.ceoc.gov. The nearest office of the EEOC or other
agency may be found online or in the local telephone directory.

Prohibition Against Any Form of Retaliation

Acts of retaliation made against an individual who reported sexual harassment or discrimination
are against the law. The Company will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee
or individual who has complained of being a victim of or a witness to harassment or discrimination.
Nor will the Company tolerate retaliation against any employee, independent contractor, intern or
other individual doing business with the Company because the individual participated in the
investigation of a complaint. All individuals should feel free and safe to report claims and
participate as a witness in the investigation of complaints without fear of retaliation of any kind.

If you believe that you have suffered retaliation for making a good faith complaint about
discrimination or harassment, or because you participated as a witness in an investigation of a
complaint, please immediately report the situation to the Healthcare Human Resources
Department. Any finding of retaliation shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

If there are any questions concerning this policy, please contact the Healthcare Human Resources
Department.

Acceptance of Policy

Everyone at the Company has a personal responsibility to conduct themselves in compliance with
this policy and to report any conduct inconsistent with this policy. If you have any questions
concerning this policy, please contact your immediate supervisor or the Healthcare Human
Resources Department.

To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, the Company expects employees
to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the Company.

It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The
performance standards listed below, and others which may be established from time to time obviously are not
all-inclusive, but are intended only to indicate some of the types of actions that are unacceptable in the
workplace. These performance standards are merely examples of the types of misconduct for which employees
may be disciplined or dismissed. By providing these examples, the Company in no way restricts its legal
discretion to discipline employees or terminate the employment relationship at will. Unacceptable conduct not
specifically listed may, nonetheless, result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.  If an employee
needs clarification of a specific issue related to these standards, she/he should seek clarification from his/her
immediate supervisor, or the Healthcare Services Group, Inc. Human Resources Department.

Employees should understand that discipline is directed at the specific act, not the individual.

Employees should be aware that engaging in the following actions or violating other Company rules while on
Company property or during the performance of their duties will subject an employee to disciplinary action, up

HOURS OF WORK

      The workweek is Sunday through Saturday. The normal workday generally will include an unpaid
meal period of at least 30 minutes, during which the employee must be completely relieved from duty. Rest
or coffee breaks of short duration will be counted as paid hours worked.

      The schedule of work hours for employees will be determined by their supervisor. The supervisor
will inform each employee of their daily schedule of hours to work, including meal periods and rest/coffee
breaks. Employees are not permitted to work overtime without the prior approval of their supervisor.

      Employee attendance at meetings and in-service training programs will be considered hours worked,
and therefore will be compensated time if attendance is requested by their supervisor.

       All non-exempt (hourly paid) employees are required to punch a time clock or complete an
individual time record showing the daily hours worked. Time records cover one workweek and must be
completed by the close of each workday. The following procedures must be followed in filling out time
records:

        1.  Employees must record their starting time, time out for meal periods, time in after
         meal periods, and quitting time for each workday.

        2.  Employees are not permitted to punch in, sign in, or begin work seven (7) or more
          minutes before their scheduled start time, or to punch out, sign out, or continue to
        work for seven (7) or more minutes after the end of their scheduled quitting time,
          without the prior approval of their supervisor.

        3. Work time will be rounded based upon an employee's start and stop time to the nearest
          quarter (1/4 or 15 minutes) of an hour.

        4.  Employees are required to take scheduled meal breaks, and must record the time
          out for meal breaks and the time in after meal breaks.

        5. Employee time records must be checked and approved by their supervisor before
          submitting for payroll processing. Employee time records missing time in or time
          out recordings (including meal breaks) must be corrected and then signed by the
         employee as agreeing to the correction prior to submission for payroll processing.

        6.  Employees will be counseled about their responsibility for recording their hours worked
           accurately.

        7.  Punching in another employee's time card, filling out another employee's time
           record, or falsifying any time record is prohibited and will result in immediate
           discharge.

        8. Under no circumstances, are employees to work off the clock (all work time must be
          properly recorded).

CALL-IN REQUIREMENTS

       Reporting to work on your scheduled workdays and being on time are very important, and
excessive absences or lateness can lead to discharge.  If for any reason you will not be able to work a
scheduled shift, or you will be getting to work late, you must call-in as soon as possible so that your
supervisor will have time to try to make adjustments to the schedule.

      Your supervisor will give you a form with specific instructions about the call-in requirements for
the facility you are working in. You must follow those instructions.  If you lose that form, or never
received it, be sure to get one from your supervisor. Note that you must talk to your supervisor directly
as part of your call-in responsibilities.


                           OVERTIME

        In most instances, overtime compensation will be calculated on the basis of the federal law
requiring payment on the basis of a 40-hour workweek, with no daily overtime rules. Each work week
begins on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday, each week independent of the other for overtime
pay.

        State laws and collective bargaining agreements may provide for a more favorable lower daily
threshold (e.g. over 7.5 hours in a day) or a lower weekly threshold (e.g. 37.5 hours in a workweek)
requiring overtime pay. Affected employees must be paid overtime pay based upon the more favorable
daily or weekly threshold.

      The company is not eligible to use the eighty (80) hours worked in a two (2) workweek period
as a basis for paying overtime. Any collective bargaining agreement citing the eighty (80) hour overtime
rule must not be used and overtime payments must be based upon the 40-hour workweek rule.





  REQUESTING, BORROWING, OR ACCEPTING MONEY, TIPS, OR GIFTS FROM
            PATEINTS/RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

     To avoid even the appearance of inappropriate conduct, Healthcare strictly prohibits requesting,
borrowing, or accepting money, tips, or gifts from patients/residents or their family members.

                       desired time. (Because of operational requirements, not all vacation requests can
                    be granted.)
                 4.       If your desired time is unavailable, select another time.

                      consecutive days that you would have been scheduled to work), a doctor's note
                        will be required upon returning to work. (Unless otherwise agreed with your

                    been scheduled to work) could result in termination.

                 4.     Medical clearance from your doctor will be required, in writing, before you
                    can return to work from an extended sick period (i.e., absent for 5 or more
                      consecutive days that you would have been scheduled to work).

UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE

        Healthcare provides three types of unpaid leaves of absence, depending upon the
circumstances of the employee's need and the employee's employment status: Military
Leave, Family and Medical Leave, and Personal Leave. Each is described below.

       Requests for any type of unpaid leave of absence must be submitted to your supervisor at
least one (1) month in advance of the expected starting date, or as soon as reasonably possible.
You will need to state the reason for the leave, the requested date of the beginning of the leave,
and the date you expect to return from the leave. Requests normally will be approved or denied
within ten (10) days of receipt of the request.

       Employees who have been granted unpaid leave are prohibited from working
elsewhere in any capacity that is inconsistent with the reason for their leave, without the
written permission of their supervisor. Violators may be discharged.


       A.   MILITARY LEAVE

       Employees will be granted Military Leave in accordance with applicable law.


     B.   FAMILYANDMEDICALLEAVE

Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid
family or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month
period.  Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already
taken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,
as described below. To be eligible for a Family/Medical Leave, an employee must have worked
for the Company for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to
taking the leave, and work at a worksite with 50 or more employees located within 75 miles. Hours
worked means actual hours worked and generally does not include paid or unpaid time off.
However, periods of absence from work due to or necessitated by qualifying military service are
counted towards an employee’s eligibility for FMLA leave.

The “12-month period” for determining FMLA eligibility is a rolling period, measured backward
from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. With the exception of Covered Service member
Leave, discussed below, this 12-month period is measured backward from the date any leave under
this policy is taken. Any leave taken pursuant to this policy, other Company policies, or law which
qualifies as leave under the FMLA will be counted against the employee’s available leave under
the applicable Company policy(s) and law, as well as the available leave under the FMLA, to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

Reasons For Leave

If eligible, an employee may take Family/Medical Leave for any of the following reasons:

B. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE

Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid
family or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month
period. Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already
taken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,
as described below. To be eligible for a Family/Medical Leave, an employee must have worked

qualifies as leave under the FMLA will be counted against the employee’s available leave under
the applicable Company policy(s) and law, as well as the available leave under the FMLA, to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

Reasons For Leave

If eligible, an employee may take Family/Medical Leave for any of the following reasons:

       “Definitions”, with a serious health condition.

Employee Medical. When due to an employee’s own serious health condition, which makes the
      employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the employee’s job.
       Pregnancy-related disability, pre-natal medical care and childbirth are covered under the
     FMLA.

Qualifying Exigency. Due to a qualifying exigency as defined in the FMLA final regulations,
        arising out of the fact that an employee’s parent, child or spouse is on active military duty
       or has been notified of any impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces in
       support of a contingency operation as a member of the National Guard or Reserves.
       Qualifying Exigency Leave is not available to employees whose military family members
       are in the Regular Armed Forces.  Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain
        military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal
       arrangements,  attending  certain  counseling  sessions,  attending  post-deployment
        reintegration briefings, and other activities associated with the family member’s call or
       order to service.  Contact the Healthcare Human Resources Department for additional
       information regarding what constitutes a qualifying exigency.

Covered Service member.  To care for a parent, child, spouse or individual for whom the
      employee is next of kin, who is a current member of the Armed Forces, including the
       National Guard and Reserves, and who is receiving treatment for or recovering from a
       serious illness or injury incurred in the line of active duty. Such leave may be taken for up
        to 26 weeks in a single 12-month period, which period begins on the first day an employee
       takes leave for this purpose and ends 12 months after that date. An eligible employee who
       takes Covered Service member Leave may not take more than a combined total of 26 weeks
       of FMLA Leave in a 12-month period, including any leave taken for other FMLA-covered
       reasons. Under such circumstances, no more than 12 weeks of FMLA Leave in a 12-month
       period may be taken for reasons other than to care for a Covered Service member.

An employee may not be granted a Family/Medical Leave to gain employment or work elsewhere,
including self-employment.   If an employee misrepresents facts in order to be granted a
Family/Medical Leave, he/she will be subject to immediate termination.

requested leave. No Family/Medical Leave will be granted without the approval of the Healthcare
Human Resources Department.

Certification

If a leave is requested because of the employee’s or a covered family member’s serious health
condition or to care for a Covered Service member, the employee and the relevant health care
provider must supply appropriate medical certification.  Medical Certification Forms may be
obtained from the Healthcare Human Resources Department.  If the need for leave is foreseeable,
the medical certification should be provided to the Company prior to the commencement of the
leave.  If the need for leave is not foreseeable, then the medical certification must be provided
within fifteen (15) days after it is requested, or as deadline extensions are granted in writing by
Healthcare’s Human Resources

Department.   It is the employee’s responsibility, not the health care provider’s, to ensure that
Healthcare’s Human Resources Department receives the fully completed medical certification by
the deadline. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in
delay or denial of leave. Under certain circumstances, the Company, at its expense, may require
an examination of the employee by a second health care provider designated by the Company.  If
the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the
Company, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct
an examination and provide a final and binding opinion. The Company also may require medical
recertification periodically during the leave and may ask for clarification of any medical
certification submitted.

Certification also is required for Qualifying Exigency Leave.  Certification forms are available
from the Healthcare Human Resources Department.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities
covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or
family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this
law, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to a request for
medical information. “Genetic information,” as defined by GINA, includes an individual’s family
medical history, the results of an individual’s or family member’s genetic tests, the fact that an
individual or an individual’s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic
information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual’s family member or an embryo
lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.

Reporting While on Leave

During a Family/Medical Leave, employees may be required to contact  their supervisors
periodically to report on their status and intention to return to work.

Leave Is Unpaid/Substitution of Paid Leave

FMLA leave is unpaid leave, except that employees will be required to use any available paid sick
time during their leave. The receipt of disability, workers’ compensation, or the substitution of
paid leave for unpaid leave time does not extend the maximum Family/Medical Leave period.

Medical and Other Benefits

During an approved Family/Medical Leave, the Company will maintain an employee’s group
health benefits as if the employee had continued to be actively employed, for up to a total of 12
weeks (or 26 weeks if Covered Service member Leave is taken) in a 12-month period.  If an
employee takes more than 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if applicable) of approved Family/Medical Leave
in a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee’s sole
expense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work. If paid leave
is substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee’s portion
of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction.  If the leave is unpaid, an employee
must pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease
for the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late.  If an employee
does not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the
Company for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during
unpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or
other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.

Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave

Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a
schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday.

        1.     Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as
             “baby-bonding” leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually
              agreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be
              taken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;

        2.     Leave due to an employee’s own serious health condition, to care for an employee’s
              spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service
           member relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where
              medically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;

        3.     Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impending
                 call to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
               intermittent or reduced work schedule.

If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked.  In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits.

Medical and Other Benefits

During an approved Family/Medical Leave, the Company will maintain an employee’s group
health benefits as if the employee had continued to be actively employed, for up to a total of 12
weeks (or 26 weeks if Covered Service member Leave is taken) in a 12-month period. If an
employee takes more than 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if applicable) of approved Family/Medical Leave
in a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee’s sole
expense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work. If paid leave
is substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee’s portion
of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If the leave is unpaid, an employee
must pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease
for the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late. If an employee
does not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the
Company for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during
unpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or
other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.

Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave

Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a
schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday.

1. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as
“baby-bonding” leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually
agreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be
taken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;

2. Leave due to an employee’s own serious health condition, to care for an employee’s
spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service
member relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where
medically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;

3. Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impending
call to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
intermittent or reduced work schedule.

If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits.

Returning From Leave

Generally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same
position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,
subject  to any applicable exceptions.   In  addition, employees have no  greater  rights  to
reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the
Family/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement
following Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates
if an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable
law.

If leave is taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition, then the employee must
provide medical certification addressing the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will
not be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided.

Legal Compliance

This policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this
policy.  Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,
whether or not specifically set forth in this policy.

C. PERSONAL LEAVE

Employees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a
period up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also
be requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet
the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by
employees who need a period of leave due to a "disability" within the meaning of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (or similar state law).

Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a
request for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the
Company will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the
Company's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (and comparable state laws).

An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former
position and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions
of employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal
Leave will be returned to his or her former position.

Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on
a Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health
insurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under
COBRA, to continue that coverage at their own expense, provided they make timely payments.




                                     18

Returning From Leave

Generally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same
position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,
subject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to
reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the
Family/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement
following Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates
if an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable
law.

If leave is taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition, then the employee must
provide medical certification addressing the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will
not be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided.

Legal Compliance

This policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this
policy. Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,
whether or not specifically set forth in this policy.

C. PERSONAL LEAVE

Employees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a
period up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also
be requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet
the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by
employees who need a period of leave due to a "disability" within the meaning of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (or similar state law).

Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a
request for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the
Company will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the
Company's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (and comparable state laws).

An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former
position and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions
of employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal
Leave will be returned to his or her former position.

Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on
a Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health
insurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under
COBRA, to continue that coverage at their own expense, provided they make timely payments.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND
                  ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)

         HIPAA PRIVACY RULE AS IT RELATES TO OUR SERVICES

      The federal government's HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that Personal Health Information
about patients/residents is protected and kept private and secure. Under HIPAA's privacy and
information security section, it is illegal to release health information to inappropriate parties or
fail to adequately protect Personal Health Information from release. The HIPAA Privacy Rule
applies to covered entities — most health care providers — including long term care facilities
and assisted living facilities.

      Most health care providers do not carry out all their health care activities by themselves.
Instead, they often use the services of a variety of other persons and businesses. These other
persons and businesses are called Business Associates in the HIPAA law. Business Associates
perform functions on behalf of the health care provider and are bound by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. From time to time, a Business Associate in performing its duties will come in contact with
Personal Health Information. Rules governing the use and disclosure of Personal Health
Information apply to Business Associates, as well as health care providers.

       Healthcare is not a Business Associate when it provides Housekeeping/Laundry/
Maintenance services. HIPAA specifically excludes entities that provide
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance services from the law because the work being performed
does not involve the use or disclosure of Personal Health Information. However, since our
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with
Personal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law.

       Healthcare is a Business Associate when it provides Food Services and is required to
comply with HIPAA. Food Service consists of the development of a meal plan that meets the
patients/residents dietary needs in connection with the over all medical plan developed in
conjunction with the health care facility. In meeting its responsibilities, Healthcare's Food
Service department on a regular basis comes in contact with residents'/patients' Personal
Health Information and must keep this information confidential.

      The HIPAA Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect individual's medical
records and other Personal Health Information.

               It gives patients/residents more control over their health information.

               It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.

               It establishes appropriate safeguards that workers in a health care facility
            must follow to protect the privacy of health information.

               It holds violators accountable.

Violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule carry both civil and criminal penalties for "wrongful
disclosure" that can include fines and jail time in certain circumstances. Failing to protect
residents'/patients' information and records by not following our privacy and security policies may
result in disciplinary action.

What Is Confidential Personal Health Information?

        Patients/residents expect that only the people who are caring for them will see their health
information and that it will only be used to help care for them. Confidential Personal Health
Information includes:

             Patient/Resident Identity

            Address

           Age

             Social Security Number

           Any other personal information that patients/residents are asked to provide.

             Diagnosis, treatments, and medications that patients/residents may receive, and other
              observations about their conditions or past health conditions.


      The facility collects Personal Health Information so it can care for the patient/resident and
perform other related functions. Depending upon your job responsibilities, if you do not need to
know confidential Personal Health Information, you will not be given access to it. That means that
you should not look at medical records, either in the computer or in paper form.

      There are occasions when you will have access to confidential Personal Health Information.
For example, if a patient/resident is placed in isolation, you may become aware of why he/she is
there or you may suspect you know why. You may see confidential Personal Health Information
about patients/residents in various places throughout the facility. Remember this information is
confidential and must not be communicated to anyone else. This information is not to be used by
you in any way or told to anyone, including coworkers, other patients/residents, visitors, or anyone
else who may ask you about it.

Ways to Protect Confidentiality

Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:

            Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a
                resident's/patient's room.

               If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information
            remember to keep it confidential.

               If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the
              information desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself.

            Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your
              job responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential.

Food Service Employees:

              Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private
            by closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so
                that others may not overhear them.

              Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have
              access to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public
                areas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor.

             Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information
            and are confidential.

            Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers
             logged into resident information while they are not at their workstation.

            Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away
            from the view of the public or people passing by.

           Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it.

           Do not store Personal Health Information in common files.

            Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the
                  facility.

Protecting confidentiality depends on you. You must not share information that you overhear or
see in the course of your work. Doing so is a violation of the law. When you do see or hear
information in the course of doing your job, remember that the information is confidential and you
are not allowed to repeat it or share it with others. This applies even when you no longer work at
the facility.

Reporting Non-Compliance

      Employees are encouraged to report non-compliance to your immediate supervisor. If you
feel that corrective action has not been taken concerning your report, you should contact
Healthcare's Corporate Compliance Officer at 1-800-523-2248. Employees will not be punished
for reporting violations. It is considered part of your job responsibilities to report instances where
you suspect that the privacy or confidentiality policies have been broken.





                      CHEMICAL USE

       Like most jobs, there are possible hazards that you should be aware of before beginning
employment. The chemicals that you use are never dangerous when used in their proper dilution
and for the use for which they are intended. However, if a patient/resident were to swallow a
chemical, or you were to accidentally spray yourself in the eye, adverse reactions can and will
occur. Always follow these guidelines:

        1.     Never use a chemical for something other than for what it is intended.

        2.    Always make sure that all bottles have proper labels. If not, report it immediately to
             your supervisor.

        3.     Avoid using old bottles for new chemicals. Even though the bottle may appear dry, a
               residue of the previous chemical often remains and could cause a chemical reaction.

        4.     Each housekeeping cart has a lockbox. All chemicals are to be stored in the lockbox.
          Do not leave your cart unattended. Store it properly while you are on break.

        5.       If you leave chemicals in the janitor's closets, the door must be locked!

        6.   NEVER MIX CHEMICALS!!!!

FIRE PROCEDURE AND EVACUATION PLAN

     As a service provider for health care facilities, Healthcare's employees must be aware of
the fire procedure and evacuation plan of the facility in which they work. Employees will be
required to assist facility personnel as instructed. Healthcare will provide training on the
facility's particular fire procedure and evacuation plan, including:

        1.     Location and use of fire extinguishers.

        2.     Location and operation of the fire alarm system.

        3.      Patient/resident evacuation procedures and your responsibilities.

        4.      Notification procedures and actions to be taken if you are the person who located
               the fire.

       In the event of a fire:

        1.     Evacuation of patients/residents from the area comes first.

        2.      Notification should be made to the designated facility person as soon as
               possible after the patients/residents have been evacuated. Be prepared to:

                   Identify the location of the fire by room or location.

                  Describe the size of the fire (large or small) and what is on fire.

        3.     Never use the word FIRE when notifying facility personnel. Instead, use
               the facility's Fire Code (generally a number or color).

        4.     Locate and use the fire alarm when warranted.

        5.     Determine whether you can extinguish the fire with the available fire
               extinguishers and fire blankets.

        6.     After being  notified, the  facility will take charge and notify the Fire
             Department, Police Department, and Evacuation Center as necessary.

        7.    The facility will coordinate its evacuation procedures, including your role, if any.

Patient/resident evacuation procedures and your responsibilities.

Notification procedures and actions to be taken if you are the person who located
the fire.

In the event of a fire:

Evacuation of patients/residents from the area comes first.

Notification should be made to the designated facility person as soon as
possible after the patients/residents have been evacuated. Be prepared to:

. Identify the location of the fire by room or location.
. Describe the size of the fire (large or small) and what is on fire.

Never use the word FIRE when notifying facility personnel. Instead, use
the facility's Fire Code (generally a number or color).

Locate and use the fire alarm when warranted.

Determine whether you can extinguish the fire with the available fire
extinguishers and fire blankets.

After being notified, the facility will take charge and notify the Fire
Department, Police Department, and Evacuation Center as necessary.

The facility will coordinate its evacuation procedures, including your role, if any.

INFECTION CONTROL

      Because many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and
are more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as
sanitary an environment as possible. By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,
employees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause
infection:

        1.     Direct contact with infected person.

        2.      Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person.

        3.    The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents.

        4.     Spread through insects.

        5.      Inoculation.

     Some Things to Remember:

        1.    Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of all
               resident rooms and bathrooms.

        2.     All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contact
               will not do the job.

        3.    Always dilute properly: too little will be ineffective, too much will be wasteful.

        4.     Never use a chemical on any surface until you are sure that it is safe for that purpose.

        5.     Since chemicals are liquid and could be swallowed, all bottles must be labeled with
               contents, ingredients, and antidote.

        6.    No cleaning or working around food while it is being served.

        7.    Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentation
            which will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution.

        8.     Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breeding
              grounds.

        9.     Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry.

       10.    Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination.

       11.   Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect any
            communicable disease.

       12.   Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because the
               disinfecting agents are still at work on your skin.

       13.   Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE

       In order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients
and a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be
physically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Therefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,
illegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient
manner.

     No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic
beverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in
Company vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the
safety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships
with its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal.

      Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical
treatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to
their supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another
assignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public.

     To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever
measures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used
at, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company
believes them to be justified and necessary. Measures that may be used will include, but not be
limited to, searches of people and of personal property located at the workplace, possibly by
law enforcement authorities, as well as drug and/or alcohol tests to be conducted when there is
reasonable suspicion of substance abuse. In addition, employees who suffer, or contribute to, a
work-related accident requiring medical treatment for any employee or facility
patient/resident, will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing if it is possible that an
impaired condition could have contributed to the accident.

     When urinalysis and/or blood tests are requested or necessary, samples will be taken
under the supervision of an appropriate health care professional. The searches and drug tests
will not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit
will result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination.

      Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily
seek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require
management referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered
by your medical insurance program. Successful treatment will be viewed positively. However,
participation in a treatment program will not prevent normal disciplinary action for a violation
which may have already occurred, nor will it relieve an employee of the responsibility to
perform assigned duties in a safe and efficient manner.

WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE

       Healthcare provides a workers' compensation program at no cost to employees for
any injury, death, or occupational disease arising out of, and in the course of, employment.

          It is very important that proper procedures be followed by all employees when injured on
the job. Although the amount of benefit coverage varies from state to state, the injured employee
may receive three basic types of benefits: medical care costs, temporary disability income, and
rehabilitation costs.

       All employees who are injured or ill resulting from a work-related incident must
inform their supervisor immediately. Supervisors are required to report immediately, or as
soon as practical, to their designated Risk Manager — Workers Compensation, all incidents
involving employees under their supervision.

     An employee who is covered by the Company's health/dental insurance who is out on
Worker's Compensation or an approved leave of absence is responsible for reimbursing the
Company for the employee deduction (employee's cost) for health/dental insurance during the
first 30 days of absence.

         If the employee's absence extends past 30 days, the employee will be responsible for the
full amount of health/dental insurance premium. If the employee does not pay the monthly
premium due within 30 days of the date specified in their Notification Letter, the health/dental
insurance will be terminated.

        Eligible employees taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 will
be entitled to continue their health/dental insurance coverage for up to 12 weeks of leave,
provided the employee makes the required employee-contributions for coverage. Employees
must notify their supervisor of this request.

      The District Manager must communicate the details of an employee's leave to the
Corporate Benefits Department so that the department may administer the collection of
payments.
