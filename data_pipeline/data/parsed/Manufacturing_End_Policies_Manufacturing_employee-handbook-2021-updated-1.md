---

**ATTENDANCE, PUNCTUALITY AND TIME RECORDS**
All employees are expected to be at work at the time scheduled for their attendance and be at their work stations at
the scheduled time for work to begin. When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to
telephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may
be absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin
when they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee’s time
sheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance
approval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to
discipline.

Upon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the
reason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor’s certificate, to substantiate the
absence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or
written reprimand, or termination of employment.

Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early
departures as well as absence for an entire day.

An employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to
have voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY.

Employees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records.
Employees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log
out for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business
purposes as part of their job duties. Tampering with another employee’s time records, including logging another
employee in or out, is prohibited and may result in immediate termination.

**BULLETIN BOARDS**

E.N.D JEWELRY uses bulletin boards to communicate important business information such as safety
rules, statutory and legal notices, company policies, and management memos. Each employee has the responsibility
to read the information that is posted. Employees may not post material on bulletin boards without the approval of
the Manager.

**CONFIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRET**

It shall be the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to develop procedures for the control, protection and
disclosure of all confidential and business information and trade secrets (collectively referred to as confidential
information). All current and former employees of E.N.D JEWELRY are prohibited from disclosing or using
confidential information for any purpose including competing with E.N.D JEWELRY, both during their
employment, and after their employment relationship at E.N.D JEWELRY has ceased.

Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, all financial books, records, instruments and
documents; purchase orders; purchase information and inventory; client lists; software programs and codes; reports;
pending proposals; marketing strategies and research; technological data; and any other instruments, records or
documents relating to or pertaining to E.N.D JEWELRY, which was received, reviewed, developed or became
known to the employee during their employment at E.N.D JEWELRY.

---

The failure to comply with this policy by an employee may result in immediate termination and legal action
to prevent the disclosure or use of the confidential information. Access to confidential information is restricted
and any employee attempting to access such information for which he or she is not authorized, may be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination.

**DISTRIBUTION OF HANDBILLS, SOLICITATIONS, AND COLLECTIONS**

Unauthorized distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections on the premises by non-
employees is prohibited at all times. Employees are required to report conditions that appear to violate this policy as
soon as possible violations are observed.

The distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections by employees to other employees are subject to
the prior approval of the General Manager. Approved distributions, solicitations, and collections may occur only on
an employee's own time, may involve only those employees who are also on their own time, and may occur only in
specified areas.

The solicitation and collection of money for special occasions (such as wedding or new baby)
experienced by employees are appropriate and will generally be approved by the General Manager.

**DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE**

To help ensure a safe, healthy and productive drug free work environment for the employees of E.N.D
JEWELRY, to protect its property and assets, and to assure efficient operations, E.N.D JEWELRY has adopted a
Policy on drugs and alcohol.

It is E.N.D JEWELRY'S policy to maintain and provide a drug and alcohol-free working environment that
is both safe for our employees and customers and conducive to efficient and productive work standards. This policy
restricts certain items and substances from being brought on to or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property,
including its parking areas and its vehicles and prohibits E.N.D JEWELRY employees and all others from reporting
to work, working or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property, *whether or not on duty* , from being under the
influence of drugs or other substances. Employees should consult and are required to comply with the Drug and
Alcohol Free Workplace and Testing Policy.

**EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION**

At the time you are hired, you are classified as full-time, part-time or temporary. You are also told whether you
qualify for overtime pay (non-exempt). Unless otherwise specified, the benefits described in this handbook apply only to
full-time employees. However, all rules, regulations and policies described in this handbook apply to all employees. Part-
time employees are employees who generally work less than a forty (40) hour week. Temporary employees are employees
who are hired for a specific project or purpose scheduled to last less than six (6) months. If you are a part-time or temporary
employee, you are not eligible for benefits described in this handbook except to the extent required by state and federal laws.

**EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE COMPANY**

---

notification shall include a brief description of the work performed and the approximate number of hours per week devoted
to it. Nothing in this requirement shall be construed to prohibit such employment, unless it interferes with the
employee’s performance of his or her job duties and responsibilities, including scheduling demands, with E.N.D
JEWELRY, or if the nature of the outside employment is deemed to have a negative impact on E.N.D JEWELRY or
creates a conflict of interest.

If E.N.D JEWELRY determines that an employee’s outside employment interferes with performance or the
ability to meet the requirements of E.N.D JEWELRY, as may be modified from time to time, or the outside
employment is deemed to have a negative impact or creates a conflict of interest, the employee may be asked to
terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain employed at E.N.D JEWELRY.

**EQUAL EMPLOYMENT**

E.N.D JEWELRY is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Equal employment opportunity is not only good
business, it’s the law and applies to all areas of employment, including recruitment, selection, hiring,
training, transfer, promotion, termination, compensation, and benefits.

E.N.D JEWELRY will recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels the most qualified applicants
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or veteran status, disability or any other condition
protected by state or federal law. Furthermore, E.N.D JEWELRY will make reasonable accommodations for
qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship.

**ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS**

Employees are expected to use good judgment, adhere to high ethical standards and avoid situations that
create an actual or perceived conflict between their personal interests and those of E.N.D JEWELRY
requires that the transactions employees participate in are ethical and within the law, both in letter and in spirit.
Employees are expected to not engaged in, directly or indirectly on or off the job, any conduct which is disruptive,
competitive, or damaging to E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that different organizations have different codes of ethics.
However, just because a certain action may be acceptable by others outside of E.N.D JEWELRY as “standard
practice,” that is by no means sufficient reason to assume that such practice is acceptable at E.N.D JEWELRY.
There is no way to develop a comprehensive, detailed set of rules to cover every business situation, therefore this
policy is intended to outline some basic guidelines to be followed. Whenever employees are in doubt, they should
consult with their manager.

---

**FINAL PAY AND RIGHT OF OFFSET**

If you resign or are terminated, your final pay, whether by check or direct deposit will be available to you
on the next regularly scheduled payday (unless other arrangements have been made). All Company property must
be returned to your Supervisor or the General Manager at the time your final check is released to you. To the extent
allowed by law, (i) any amounts owing, including for tool purchases, to the Company or the monetary value of
any unreturned Company property, including Company tools and uniforms will be deducted from the
employee's final paycheck; and (ii) any employee who has engaged in misconduct (i.e. intentional or deliberate
conduct that causes injury, damage or loss to the Company) will have offset from any final check and/or payment of
accrued but unused vacation, the monetary amount of any injury, damage or loss as determined by the Company.
To the extent the final paycheck is not enough to satisfy the amounts owed to the Company by you, you agree to
immediately pay such amount or forfeit all tools equal in value to the amount owed to the Company.

**FIRE, DISASTER AND OTHER EMERGENCIES**

The importance of fire and other calamities' prevention cannot be too strongly emphasized. Your
Supervisor or the General Manager will inform you of your duties in the event of a fire or other emergency. You
should immediately report any fire hazard to your Supervisor or the General Manager. In case of emergencies,
your Supervisor or the General Manager will give correct procedures to be followed as to safe evacuation, or areas
appropriate for safety of Employees, members and guests.

**HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION**

E.N.D JEWELRY is committed to maintaining a work environment that is free from intimidation and
harassment, that fosters mutual employee respect and promotes harmonious productive working relationships.
Every employee of E.N.D JEWELRY is responsible for assuring that the work place is free from all forms of
harassment and discrimination. E.N.D JEWELRY prohibits and will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of
any employee due to age, race, sex, religion, color, national origin, disability, or on any other basis that would be in
violation of any applicable federal, state, or local law.

***Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of verbal, visual or physical conduct that belittles, demeans
or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual for reasons including, but not limited to his/her gender, race,
religion, color, national origin, age, sexual preference or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates,
and that:  has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment;
 has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or
 otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.
***Sexual Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual comments, advances, request for

sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

 submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s
employment;
 submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions
affecting such individual; or
 such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work
environment.

Prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or
contact to physical contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is offensive or harassing to others.
Examples of conduct which could be considered sexual harassment include:

---

 sexually suggestive jokes or gestures directed toward another or sexually oriented or degrading
comments about another;
 preferential treatment of an employee or a promise of preferential treatment to an employee in exchange
for dates or sexual conduct, or the denial or threat of denial of employment benefits or advancements for
refusal to consent to sexual advances;
 the open display of sexually oriented pictures, posters, or other material offensive to others; and
 retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct.

All employees are encouraged to express displeasure at any conduct which might be sexually harassing, to
tell the individual engaging in the conduct that it is unwelcome, and to report the conduct as described in this policy.

Occasionally, talking with a supervisor or another employee about the harassment is not sufficient for
reporting a complaint of harassment. If you feel you are being harassed, you should immediately inform the person
harassing you that his or her behavior is unwelcome and must stop. You should always promptly report the matter
to the General Manager. Although, delayed reporting of a complaint could hinder the Company’s ability to
effectively investigate the complaint, it will not in and of itself preclude the Company from investigating the matter
and taking appropriate action.

If the person you feel is harassing you is General Manager, you should contact the Chief Executive
Officer of E.N.D JEWELRY, immediately.

E.N.D JEWELRY has no requirement for the form or content of a harassment complaint. Although the
complaint may be verbal, a written statement may be required as part of the investigation to be conducted by E.N.D
JEWELRY. Allegations of harassment and discrimination are taken very seriously. You have a duty to fully
comply with the investigation. You should provide as much information as possible regarding the
offending incident or conduct, including what happened or is continuing to happen, the person or persons
causing the harassment, and the time(s) and place(s) that the incident(s) or conduct occurred. If available,
the names of witnesses should be provided, but you should not hesitate to report harassment merely because
witnesses are not available or cannot be identified.

All complaints will be investigated promptly. The complaint will be investigated in as confidential of a
manner as possible, but confidentiality cannot be promised. If an investigation confirms that harassment in violation
of this policy has occurred, E.N.D JEWELRY will take appropriate corrective action as determined by it in its sole
discretion. The corrective action may include discipline up to and including termination. The extent and type of
corrective action taken may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of the particular
employee and the nature of the offense. There will be no retaliation by E.N.D JEWELRY against any employee
who makes a good-faith report, even if, after investigation, it appears that there has been no violation. However,
false reports are another form of harassment and should not be made.

If either party directly involved in a harassment or discrimination investigation is dissatisfied with
the outcome or resolution, that individual has the right to appeal the decision by submitting his or her written
comments in a timely manner to the General Manager of E.N.D JEWELRY

**HOLIDAYS**

It Is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to designate and observe certain days each year as holidays. As listed below will

---

New Year’s Day
Memorial Day
Independence Day (July 4th)
Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Day after Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Eve
Christmas Day
New Year’s Eve
One floating holiday as determined by the Company

Temporary employees, part-time employees, and employees on leaves of absence or on lay-off are not eligible to
receive holiday pay. Full-time employees, for both day and night shifts, are eligible to receive their regular hourly rate of
pay for eight (8) hours (no overtime wages will be paid) for each observed holiday.

To receive holiday pay, an eligible employee must be at work, or on an authorized absence, on the work days
immediately preceding and immediately following the day on which the holiday is observed. If an employee is absent on
one or both of these days because of an illness or injury, the Company reserves the right to verify the reason for the absence
before approving holiday pay.

A holiday that occurs on a Saturday or Sunday may be observed on either the preceding Friday or
following Monday as determined by E.N.D JEWELRY.

If a holiday occurs during an employee’s vacation period, the employee will be given an additional day of paid
vacation, which may be taken at the beginning or end of the employee’s vacation period, subject to the prior approval of the
employee’s supervisor.

E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that some employees may wish to observe, as periods of worship or
commemoration, certain days which are not included in E.N.D JEWELRY'S holiday schedule. Employees who
would like to take a day off for such reasons may be permitted to do so if the employee’s absence from work will
not result is an undue hardship in the operation of E.N.D JEWELRY'S business and if prior approval has been
obtained from the employee’s supervisor. Employees may use their paid vacation on such occasions, or they may
take such time off as an unpaid, excused absence.

---

**INJURY OR ILLNESS ON THE JOB**

Any employee reporting an on-the-job injury or illness will receive immediate and appropriate medical treatment.
All applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations pertaining to occupational injuries or illnesses will be followed and
complied with at all times.

It is the responsibility of all employees to report immediately to their supervisor all on-the-job injuries or illnesses
regardless of how insignificant or minor the injury or illness may appear at the time.

When employees sustain an injury or illness that requires outside medical treatment, the employees may
also be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law
permits these tests. When employees are involved in a accident that results in significant property damage, the
employees may be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system,
provided state law permits these tests. Any employee who refuses screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol
will be subject to immediate termination.

**MAINTENANCE OF WORK AREAS**

It is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY that work areas are to be kept clean and orderly

All employees are responsible for maintaining there work areas in a clean and orderly fashion at all times. To
fulfill this responsibility, each employee should, at a minimum, do the following:

 Prior to the end of the work day, clean and organize all tools and equipment and properly secure any
items, papers, or information of value; and
 Place coats, boots, umbrellas, and other items of clothing in designated areas so that work stations are not
unnecessarily cluttered.

Supervisors are responsible for making sure that their employees maintain their work areas in accordance with the
requirements of this policy. Each supervisor should:

 Make sure that aisles, floors, and walls are free of debris and other unnecessary items and that all end-of-
the-shift tasks have been performed;
 Monitor the facilities and equipment and issue maintenance requests where appropriate;
 Arrange for the removal of any items from the work place that are not needed for the flow of business or
the comfort and enhancement of employees;
 Report to the Manager any existing or potential workplace hazards; and
 Ensure that all trash, waste, and scrap are properly disposed.

---

While the Company encourages friendly relationships between members of management and non-management
employees, it recognizes that involvement in a romantic relationship may compromise or create a perception that
compromises a member of management’s ability to perform his or her job. Any involvement of a romantic nature between a
manager or supervisor and anyone he or she supervises, either directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Violation of this policy
may lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination of the management individual involved in the relationship.

**OPEN COMMUNICATION**

At E.N.D JEWELRY, communication is at the heart of good employee relations. Employees should share
their concerns, seek information, provide input, and resolve work-related issues by discussing them with their
supervisors until they are fully resolved. It may not be possible to achieve the results an employee wants, but the
supervisor needs to attempt to explain in each case why a certain course of action is preferred. If an issue cannot be
resolved at this level, the employee is welcome to discuss the issue with the Human Resources Manager, General
Manager, or Chief Executive Officer.

Regardless of the situation, employees should be able to openly discuss any work-related problems and
concerns without fear of retaliation. Managers and supervisors are expected to listen to employee concerns,
encourage their input, and seek resolution to the issues and concerns. Often this will require setting a meeting in the
near future. Managers and supervisors are to set these meetings as quickly as possible, and employees are expected
to understand that issues and concerns may not always be addressed at the moment they arise. Discussing these
issues and concerns with management will likely help to find an acceptable solution for nearly every situation.

If an employee has a concern about harassment or discrimination, E.N.D JEWELRY has set up special
procedures to
report and address those issues. The proper reporting procedures are set forth in the Harassment and Discrimination
policy.

**OVERTIME**

All overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor and noted on the time reporting system.
Holidays, personal leave and other personal absences will not be counted as working hours when computing
overtime pay. Overtime compensation will be one and one-half (1 ½) times the Employee's regular pay rate and will
not include any special form of compensation or bonuses.

**PAY PERIODS**

Employees are paid on a Bi-weekly basis every other Friday. Day shift employees will receive their
paycheck on Friday. Night shift employees will receive their paycheck on Thursday night after 8:00 pm. When such
payday falls on a holiday or a non-business day, payday will be the preceding business day. If any error
occurs on your paycheck, notify the General Manager. The error will be corrected as soon as possible. In the
event the employee’s paycheck is to be received by someone other than the employee, E.N.D JEWELRY
must have signed written instructions from the employee and E.N.D JEWELRY will require the person picking up
the paycheck to provide a picture identification card.

**NON-FRATERNIZATION**

---

Employees working in office areas should dress conservatively and professionally. Skirts and dresses should not
be any shorter than three (3) inches above the knee. Blue jeans and tee shirts are acceptable office dress unless otherwise
determined by the General Manager, however dress standards still require a neat, clean appearance. Employees meeting
with customers should wear appropriate business attire.

Employees working in manufacturing, maintenance, and warehouse areas may wear blue jeans and T-shirts.
Shorts may be worn, unless otherwise determined by the General Manager. Steel-toed shoes, and other safety equipment is
to be worn at all times by employees working in the manufacturing, maintenance, and warehouse areas. Long hair
must be tied back to ensure employees’ personal safety. Loose clothing or dangling JEWELRY that poses a safety
hazard to employees is also prohibited.

Employees should avoid wearing halter tops, strapless tops, spaghetti straps, tank tops, cropped tops, sleeve-less
shirts, shirts with alcohol or tobacco logos or offensive wording on them, clothing that shows undergarments (sheer), torn
clothing, or clothing with holes in it. All clothing must be clean, neat, and fit properly.

For all employees, professional appearance also means that E.N.D JEWELRY expects you to maintain
good hygiene and grooming while working. Facial hair is permitted as long as it is neat and well trimmed. Earrings
are acceptable; however, excessive numbers of earrings and other body piercing JEWELRY may not be worn during
work hours. All tattoos offensive in nature, as determined in the sole discretion of the General Manager, must be
covered at all times during work hours.

Clothing must not constitute a safety hazard. All employees should practice common sense rules of
neatness, good taste, and comfort. Provocative clothing is prohibited. E.N.D JEWELRY reserves the right to
determine appropriate dress at all times and in all circumstances and may send employees home to change clothes
should it be determined their dress is not appropriate. Employees will not be compensated for this time away from
work.

**SHORT-TERM ABSENCES–NONPAID**

It is the policy of the Company to permit full-time employees to be absent from work on a short-term basis under
certain circumstances, including sickness or injury.

An authorized short-term absence may include any of the following (the phrase “immediate family” includes the

Absences resulting from jury duty will not be charged against an employee’s short-term absences.

Employees are prohibited from falsifying the reason for an absence. The Company may require an employee to
submit to a medical examination or provide a doctor’s statement to verify a claimed sickness or injury. If this examination
or statement should establish that the employee is not actually suffering from an illness or injury, the employee will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and absence compensation will be stopped immediately.

Authorized days off for short-term absences will not be considered as working time for calculating weekly
overtime compensation.

vendors, and visitors. Employees will be permitted to smoke in the shop, except in areas that are otherwise prohibited. The
prohibited areas in the shop will be designated by the General Manager and may be changed from time to time.

E.N.D JEWELRY grants annual vacations with pay to full-time employees in accordance with the
guidelines below. The amount of your paid vacation is determine each year on the anniversary date of beginning

During each year, employees must work at least ninety percent (90%) of their normally scheduled time each
month, not including time off for paid short-term absence days, vacations, or holidays, in order to receive the full amount of
paid vacation for the following year. Employees who feel there is a discrepancy in the calculation of their vacation pay or
eligibility may request a review of that calculation by the personnel department. Vacation pay for full-time employee will

Employees should request vacation from their supervisor at least 60 days in advance. The General

accrues, except that an employee may carry over six (6) months into the next vacation year up to forty (40) hours of
unused paid vacation. Employees will not be paid for any unused vacation, except as required by law.

Employees whose employment is terminated for any reason other than cause or resignation without proper notice,
or who are laid off for more than thirty days, will be compensated for any unused vacation accrued at the time of termination
or lay off. If an employee dies, payment for accrued and unused vacation will be paid in a lump sum to the employee’s
estate.

These additional vacation hours may be taken at the beginning or end of the employee’s vacation period or at another time
during the vacation year, so long as the supervisor’s prior approval is obtained. No allowance will be made for sickness or
other compensable type of absence occurring during a scheduled vacation.

##### Workplace Search Policy

1. **Aim**
The aim of this Policy is to outline the circumstances in which E.N.D Jewelry LLC might decide
to stop and search those working in the organization, and the arrangements relating to this.

This Policy only relates to the stopping and searching of those working within the organization.
This includes those who are not employees including casual workers, self-employed
contractors, or agency staff. The Policy does not address any search that might be required
in relation to customers or other visitors to the organization.

1. **General principles**
The searching of those who work at E.N.D Jewelry LLC will only be carried out by trained
team members. A list of those team members who are trained to carry out searches is held
by the HR Team.

The trained team member will outline the following prior to any search being carried out:

a. explain the reason for the search (i.e. random search).
b. that a written record will be kept of the stop and search process being undertaken.
c. the individual being searched may request that the search is undertaken by a person
of the same gender. This should be explained and the individual requests this before
the search commences.
d. a non-intimate search covers a variety of types of searches i.e. physical property being
searched such as lockers, drawers, bags, exterior clothing being worn by or belonging
to the team member (pockets of coats, jeans etc.).
e. the individual being searched has the right to request that a colleague is present during
the search. This should be explained and requested by the individual before the search
commences; and
f. the individual owning the property being searched will usually be present during the
search. It is only in exceptional situations that this will not be the case, and such
searches must be authorized by a senior manager of E.N.D Jewelry LLC.

1. **Searching of bags**
E.N.D Jewelry LLC reserves the right to search the bags of any individual (employee, casual
worker, contractor, or agency worker) working in the organization as they enter or leave the
organization’s premises.

If it is intended to carry out a search, the individual who owns the bags being searched will be
asked to come to a private room. The individual will either be asked to empty their bag or will
be asked to give the bag to the person carrying out the search for him/her to look and search

![a sign that says "no parking"](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing_employee-handbook-2021-updated-1_image_31_0.png)

inside. If the individual is required to empty the bag the person carrying out the search will
then inspect the empty bag.

1. **Other searches**
On some occasions it might also be deemed appropriate to search other items – for example
coats. In such a situation the individual being searched will be asked to come to a private
room. The individual will be asked to allow the search to proceed.

1. **Refusing to allow a search**
An individual working for the organization cannot refuse to allow a search to take place.

If an individual working for the organization does refuse to allow a trained team member to
carry out a search, they will be asked to give a reason for the refusal. This will be noted
down and addressed immediately.

If the refusal relates to a concern about the team member who is carrying out the search (for
example, because they are of the opposite gender) then another trained team member
may be asked to carry out the search.

Refusal to allow a search to continue once any concerns have been addressed may result in
disciplinary action.

1. **Frequency of searches**
There is no limitation on the number of occasions on which an individual can be searched.

1. **Recording of searches**
The team member carrying out the search will be required to make a note in the stop and search
record of every search that is carried out. The following information will be logged:

**a.** Date of search;
**b.** Time of search;
**c.** Individual searched (name and department);
**d.** Items searched (e.g. vehicle, bag); and
**e.** Any action taken.

The search record must be signed by both the team member carrying out the search and the individual who
was searched.

1. **Complaints about the search process**
Any complaints about the search process should be addressed in the greivence mechanism setup under
www.endpolicies.com which can be submitted anonymously
