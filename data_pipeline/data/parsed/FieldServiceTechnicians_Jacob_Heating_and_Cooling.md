## 100. ORGANIZATION - DESCRIPTION

#### I. Goods and Services Provided

Our company has two divisions: Jacob Sheet Metal Works and Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning.

Jacob Sheet Metal Works fabricates in light gauge sheet metal. We offer galvanized, black iron
(cold rolled) metal, aluminum, stainless steel and copper. Our 10' power shear can handle up to
16-gauge galvanized metal (the lower the number, the thicker the material). We do not do any
welding, including of aluminum. We solder galvanized, stainless steel and copper. Our sales
include everything from small over-the-counter orders, to work performed for various industrial
and commercial firms in our area.

It is the policy of the company that over-the-counter sheet metal orders will be taken on a first
come, first serviced basis. Discretion will be used to prioritize orders that offer more revenue and
benefit to the company (ex: a $2000 job vs. a $10 order). The company will make every attempt
to advise customers of an appropriate timeframe that it will take to fulfill an order.

It is important to note that sheet metal ductwork used by our air conditioning division is fabricated
in our shop and these jobs will take precedence to other sheet metal jobs due the primary nature
of the business.

Most typical duct fittings, such as elbows, boots, and collars are purchased through wholesale
distributors. We generally use sheet metal trunk lines, wrapped in duct wrap insulation, followed
by flex supply runs. It is the philosophy of the company that this provides the customer with a
superior duct system, and JH&A is the only company in the area that offers this. We will use
fiberglass duct board for plenums and trunk lines as the specific job is bid.

Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning conducts business in HVAC repair, maintenance, equipment
sales and installation. Our sales are primarily residential and light commercial. In recent years
we have begun to take on more commercial jobs, such as the Main Street Bank in DeLand. Our
primary installation and repair work is for single family residences. We do not currently perform
any refrigeration or chiller work.

We occasionally do new home construction; this would typically be a custom home situation, as
we are not in the business of new home construction.

We install and repair gas furnaces and oil-fired furnaces. We do not work on carburetor-type oil
furnaces.

We install and repair water-to-air heat pumps.

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_7_2.png)

We generally do not work on window ale units. However, we reserve the right to service a
customer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two people to
remove the customer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two
people to remove the window or wall unit and bring it to our shop for bench repairs. The customer
must be advised the repairs could be costly, and it may be beneficial to buy a new unit.

#### II. Facilities and Location(s):

Our offices and sheet metal shop are located at 611 E. International Speedway Blvd., DeLand FL

1. This street is also known as East Highway 92. Our business is located within the DeLandcity limits.

Our main phone number is: (386) 734-The back line is: (386) 734-9096. This number should be used for calls outside of regular business
hours.

Our fax line is: (386) 734-#### III. History of Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning:

Jacob Sheet Metal Works was founded in 1921 by Rudolph Jacob, Robert Jacob's grandfather.
He moved to DeLand from Ohio and began working with a wooden brake installing metal roofs,
copper work, guttering, and later warm air heating ducts. In those days, metal was shipped down
the St. John's River and received at the Lake Beresford settlement.

After World War II Robert's father, Paul Jacob joined Rudolph in the family business. Paul’s
brother, Ervin Jacob, also worked with the company until 1977. The business was incorporated
in 1964.

Jacob Sheet Metal Works continued as a thriving business in DeLand during the 50’s, 60's and
70’s. The company started concentrating on central heating & air conditioning installations as their
popularity grew.

Throughout the years, the company has gained a reputation in West Volusia County as the top-
quality repair and installation company. We have many customers who have been doing business
with Jacob Sheet Metal 30-60 years, and we respect these people tremendously. Jacob Sheet
Metal Works is one of DeLand's oldest businesses.

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_8_2.png)

Robert Jacob grew up in the family business. He obtained college degrees from Daytona Beach
Community College and Florida Atlantic University and joined the firm in 1974 after servicing in
the U.S. Army. Robert’s wife, Kim Jacob spent her career as an elementary school teacher.
Robert and Kim have two children, Jennifer and Clinton. Robert is an active member and deacon
in the First Presbyterian Church of DeLand.

Robert's father, Paul, retired, but continued to lead an active life, working around the sheet metal
shop nearly every day, until he passed away at the age of 88.

In 1998 our heating & air conditioning business evolved to becoming 85% of the company's total
sales. Even then, many people in town did not realize that the company did A/C work due to the
name, “Jacob Sheet Metal Works.” For that reason, Robert decided it was time to clarify the
position in the marketplace by creating a branch called "Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning." This
change resulted in major growth in our company, as we now have one of the most recognized
names in West Volusia County.

Other internal changes have occurred in recent years, including becoming more efficient. In we changed our repair pricing to "Flat-Rate Pricing." This is a proven feature in our industry, which
has brought higher profits and stability, and allowed us to pay higher wages to our employees.
We have also increased employee training and have developed a wide range of employee
benefits.

Most important, the company is extremely proud to say it has several employees who have been
with the company over 10 years, and two have been with us 20 years and over. We are constantly
striving to increase our place in the market. Through better management, organization and
teamwork, we become more profitable.

#### IV. Organizational Structure:

Our company is a corporation registered in the State of Florida.

Our company is an official Qualified Business Organization in the State of Florida. Holding a State
Class A Contractors License (CAC024345) and L.P. gas license.

Fully insured with business liability and workers comp insurance.

Memberships: V.A.C.C.A. (county) and A.C.C.A. (national).

#### V. Role of the Human Resources Department:

Due to the size of the company, the role of Human Resources is fulfilled through a team effort by
the President, the office employees, a supervisor, and you, as the employee.

#### VI. Management Philosophy:

It is the philosophy of our company that we work as a team, with true success coming only through
the combined efforts of each and every employee. Our management philosophy is to expect
quality work from our employees, who will receive respect, competitive wages, and above average
benefits in return.

We believe in an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. Every employee is expected to
contribute his best effort, each day, to produce quality service to our customers. We believe this
will assure a winning combination, for the company, its employees, and also for the customer.

We believe in an open-door policy and strive to create an atmosphere where employees are
encouraged to discuss their problems openly with their superiors, without fear of reprisal, and
share their accomplishments with others. Every effort will be made to assure each employee is
always respected and treated equitably.

#### VII. Goals:

Our goal is to provide the highest quality service to our customers, at a fair price. In doing so we
will provide a profitable business in which our employees can grow while creating a loyal client
base within the West Volusia area.

## 101. Nature of Employment

This handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel
policies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook,
for it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A.

However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about
employment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is
not intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is
bound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship
at any time.

In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A
reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in
this handbook, except for its policy of employment-at-will. The only recognized deviations from
the stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A.

## 102. Employee Relations

JH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are
competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees
have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice
these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors.

Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors," the
work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive.
We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding
effectively to employee concerns.

## 103. Equal Employment Opportunity

In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals,
employment decisions at JH&A will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. JH&A does
not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
disability, veteran status, national origin, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. .

This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment,
compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_11_2.png)

Any employee with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace is
encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor. Employees can
raise concerns and make reports without fear of retaliation Anyone found to be engaging in any
type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination
of employment.

## 104. Business Ethics and Conduct

The successful business operation and reputation of JH&A is built upon the principles of fair
dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires
careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a
scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity.

The continued success of JH&A is dependent upon our customers' trust and we are dedicated to
preserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to JH&A, its customers, and shareholders to act in a
way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public.

JH&A will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers, and
employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws
and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.

In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you with respect
to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper
course of action, the matter should be discussed openly with your immediate supervisor. If
necessary, the matter should be escalated to Management for advice and consultation.

Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every JH&A
employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct
could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

## 105. Hiring of Relatives

The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and
problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at
work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working
relationships. All hiring of family will be considered in a case-by-case basis in consideration of
organizational impact. ·

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_12_2.png)

In cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory
relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or terminated from
employment.

For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or
whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or
marriage.

## 106. Employee Medical Examinations

To help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely, medical examinations may
be required.

After an offer has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical
questionnaire will be required, and a medical examination may be required at JH&A's expense by
a health professional of JH&A's choice. The offer of employment and assignment to duties is
contingent upon completion of the questionnaire.

Any employee off work more than three continuous workdays for an unforeseen illness or injury
may be required to present JH&A with a written status report from a qualified healthcare provider.
The status report must contain a diagnosis of the illness or injury, an acceptable explanation of
why the employee cannot perform his or her job duties, and a reasonable expected return-to-work
date. (Also see employee policies under Section 601 "Medical Leave").

Information on an employee's medical condition or history will be kept separate from other
employee information and maintained confidentially. Access to this information will be limited to
those who have a legitimate need to know.

## 107. Immigration Law Compliance

JH&A is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to
work in the United States and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or
national origin.

In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a
condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form 1-9 and
present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who
are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed a 1-9 with JH&A within the
past three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_13_2.png)

Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged
to contact the Controller. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law
compliance without fear of reprisal.

## 108. Conflicts of Interest

Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or
potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which JH&A
wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction
so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable
standards of operation. Contact Management for more information or questions about conflicts of
interest.

An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a
decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of JH&A's
business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood
or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related
by blood or marriage.

No "presumption of guilt" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.
However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or
leases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of JH&A as soon as possible the existence
of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all
parties.

Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant
ownership in a firm with which JH&A does business, but also when an employee or relative
receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any
transaction or business dealings involving JH&A.

## 109. Outside Employment

Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they are open and honest about their outside
employment with their direct supervisor and meet the performance standards of their job with
JH&A. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to
JH&A's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the outside
role precedes employment with JH&A, the employee should make the intention to maintain their
outside position during the application/interview process with JH&A.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_14_2.png)

If JH&A determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to
meet the requirements of JH&A as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be
asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with JH&A.

"Moonlighting," or outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited.
Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside JH&A for
materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs.

Due to various reasons, the following will be considered as unacceptable conflicts of interests:

--- Working for a competitor as a direct employee or as a subcontractor

--- Taking business away from JH&A by serving an existing customer

--- Any business that uses JH&A time or material.

It is important to note that service performed by an individual employee outside of JH&A business
hours could be interpreted as JH&A related work from a legal perspective, and that it is against
the law for a homeowner to hire an unlicensed individual to perform work. JH&A is in no way
responsible for business performed by an individual outside of assigned jobs/duties.

## 110. Non-Disclosures

The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and
the success of JH&A. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following
examples:

--- wages or personal employee data

--- computer programs and codes ·

--- customer lists

--- customer preference

--- financial information

--- marketing strategies

--- pricing for pending projects and proposals

Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business s information
will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal
action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_15_2.png)

## 111. Disability Accommodations

JH&A is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring
equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. All employment practices
and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis.

Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful
employment opportunities. Pre-employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's
ability to perform the duties of the position.

Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where their disability affects
the performance of job functions. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the
situation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual.

Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation
(or changes in compensation) as well as in job assignments, classifications, organizational
structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists. Leave of all types will be
available to all employees on an equal basis.

JH&A is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified employees or applicants
because they are related to or associated with a person with a disability. JH&A will follow any
state or local law that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA.

This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. JH&A is committed to taking all other actions
necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance
with the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.

## 112. Employment Categories

It is the intent of JH&A to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees
understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee
employment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the employment
relationship at will at any time is retained by both the employee and JH&A.

Each employee is designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage
and hour laws. NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific
provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT employees are excluded from specific provisions
of federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee's EXEMPT or NONEXEMPT classification
may be changed only upon written notification by JH&A management.

In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong lo one other employment category:

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_16_2.png)

REGULAR FULL-TIME employees are those who are not in a temporary or introductory status
and who are regularly scheduled to work JH&A's full-time schedule. Generally, they are eligible
for JH&A's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit
program.

PART-TIME employees are those who are not assigned to a temporary or introductory status and
who are regularly scheduled to work less than 32 hours per week. While they do receive all legally
mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are
ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs.

INTRODUCTORY employees are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine
whether further employment in a specific position or with JH&A is appropriate. Employees who
satisfactorily complete the introductory period will be notified of their new employment
classification.

TEMPORARY employees are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily
supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment
assignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated
period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain
that status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally
mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are
ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs.

CASUAL employees are tho.se who have established an employment relationship with JH&A but
who are assigned to work on an intermittent and/or unpredictable basis. While they receive all
legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they
are ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs.

## 113. Access to Personnel Files

JH&A maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information
as the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance
appraisals and salary increases, and other employment records.

Personnel files are the property of JH&A, and access to the information they contain is restricted.
Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of JH&A who have a legitimate reason
to review information in a file are allowed to do so.

Employees who wish to review their own file should contact their manager. With reasonable
advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in JH&A's offices and in the
presence of an individual appointed by JH&A to maintain the files.

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_17_2.png)

## 114. Employment Reference Checks

To ensure that individuals who join JH&A are well qualified and have a strong potential to be
productive and successful, it is the policy of JH&A to check the references of all applicants. All
applicants will be asked, in writing, to authorize background checks for felony convictions, driver’s
license reports, workers comp reports, and a nation-wide search on sex offender violations. The
information obtained from the screening will be considered on a case by case basis and each
situation will be considered individually.

Management will respond in writing only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in
writing. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and
position(s) held.

## 115. Personnel Data Changes

It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify JH&A of any changes in personnel
data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents,
individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, and other
such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personnel data has
changed, notify the Office Manager.

## 116. Introductory Period

The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their
ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position
meets their expectations. JH&A uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits,
and overall performance. Either the employee or JH&A may end the employment relationship at
will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice.

All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after
their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the
length of the absence. If JH&A determines that the designated introductory period does not allow
sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may
be extended for a specified period.

Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the "regular"
employment classification.

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_18_2.png)

During the introductory period, new employees are eligible for those benefits that are required by
law, such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security. After becoming regular
employees, they may also be eligible for other JH&A provided benefits, subject to the terms and
conditions of each benefits program. Employees should read the information for each specific
benefits program for the details on eligibility requirements.

Your employment with JH&A is a voluntary one and is subject to termination by you or JH&A at
will, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall
be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the employment-at-will
status of JH&A employees.

This policy of employment-at-will may not be modified by any officer or employee and shall not
be modified in any publication or document. The only exception to this policy is a written
employment agreement approved at the discretion of the President or the Board of Directors,
whichever is applicable.

## 117. Employment Applications

JH&A relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well
as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any
misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may
result in JH&A's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the
person has been hired, termination of employment.

## 118. Performance Evaluation

Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an
informal, day-to-day basis. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide
both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct
weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches
for meeting goals.

Performance evaluations are scheduled approximately every 12 months, generally occurring in
the late spring.

Merit-based pay adjustments are awarded by JH&A in an effort to recognize truly superior
employee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous
factors, including the information documented by this formal performance evaluation process.

## 119. Employee Benefits

Eligible employees at JH&A are provided a wide range of benefits. A number of the programs
(such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance)
cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law.

Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your
supervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs
can be found elsewhere in the employee handbook.

The following benefit programs are available to eligible employees:

--- COBRA Major Medical Benefit Conversion at Termination

--- Drug or Alcohol Rehabilitation Program (at employee's own expense)

--- Employee Assistance Program (through the Drug Free Workplace)

--- Family Leave (as required by Law)

--- Holidays

--- Major Medical Insurance for Employee

--- Dependent Major Medical Insurance through payroll deduction

--- Pharmacy (prescription drug plan included in Major Medical Insurance)

--- Paid Time Off (PTO is similar to Vacation & Sick Leave)

--- Pension Plan/ Simple IRA Contributions with Company matching (matching amount
decided by retirement plan provider)

--- Spiffs*

--- Supplemental Plans through payroll deduction:

- (Dental, Short-Term Disability, Accident, Hospital Indemnity, and Cancer Plans)
--- Uniforms

--- Voting Time Off

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_20_2.png)

Some benefit programs require contributions from employees, but most are paid by JH&A. The
benefit package for regular full-time employees represents an additional cost to JH&A of
approximately 32 percent of wages.

Due to government regulations, there may be a waiting period required for certain benefits. For a
current and comprehensive list of benefits guidelines and plans, see the Office Manager.

*Spiff benefits will only be extended/paid to Full-Time/Active employees.

## 120. Holidays

--- JH&A will grant holiday time off to all employees on the holidays listed below:

--- New Year's Day (January 1)

--- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)

--- Independence Day (July 4)

--- Labor Day (first Monday in September)

--- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)

--- Christmas (December 25)

JH&A will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees immediately upon assignment to an
eligible employment classification. Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee's
straight-time pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee
would otherwise have worked on that day. Eligible employee classification(s):

--- Regular full-time employees

A recognized holiday that falls on a Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday. A
recognized holiday that falls on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday.

If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's paid absence (such as vacation or sick
leave), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have
applied.

If eligible nonexempt employees work on a recognized holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus
wages at their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. Due to business needs,
there will be on-call requirements for Service Technicians and those who are deemed as “on-call”

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_21_2.png)

will inevitably work holidays. The holiday on-call schedule will be determined in advance and
requests for PTO will be accommodated the best of JH&A’s ability, but are not guaranteed.

Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining
whether overtime pay is owed.

## 121. Workers' Compensation Insurance

JH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to
employees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that
requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements,
workers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee
is hospitalized, immediately.

Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor
immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be
reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as
possible. Depending on the requirements of the Worker’s Compensation insurance provider, and
the situation, a drug and/or alcohol test may be required of the employee to submit a claim.

Neither JH&A nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation
benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty
recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by JH&A.

## 122. Time Off to Vote

JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections.
Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work
schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, JH&A will
grant up to 1 hour of paid time off to vote.

Employees should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two working days prior to
the election day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at
the beginning or end of the work shift, whichever provides the least disruption to the normal work
schedule.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_22_2.png)

## 123. Jury Duty

JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when
required. JH&A will pay an employee for up to 5 days of jury duty, with proof of summons. After days, employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired,
employees may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits).

Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the
supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Employees are expected to
report for work whenever the court schedule permits.

Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the
employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties.

JH&A will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence.

Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave.

## 124. Witness Duty

JH&A encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so.

If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by JH&A,
they will receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty.

Employees will be granted unpaid time off to appear in court as a witness when requested by a
party other than JH&A. Employees are free to use any available paid leave benefit (such as
vacation leave) to receive compensation for the period of this absence.

The subpoena should be shown to the employee's supervisor immediately after it is received so
that operating requirements can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee's
absence. The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits.

## 125. Benefits Continuation (COBRA)

The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and
their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under JH&A's
health plan when a "qualifying event" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_23_2.png)

qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a
reduction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal
separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements.

Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at JH&A's group rates
plus an administration fee. JH&A provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing
rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under JH&A's
health insurance plan.

The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations.

## 126. Educational Assistance

JH&A recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the
organization.

Individual courses or courses that are part of a degree, licensing, or certification program must be
related to the employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position in the organization in
order to be eligible for educational assistance. JH&A has the sole discretion to determine whether
a course relates to an employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position. Employees
should contact Management for more information or questions about educational assistance and
financial availability for educational assistance.

The following pay guidelines will apply when employees are attending classes, seminars and
educational courses, and their attendance is specifically required by Jacob Heating & Air
Conditioning:

--- Employees attending company-required classes during their regular workday hours, Monday
through Friday, will be paid a total of their hours worked and the hours spent in class and travel
during the day.

--- Employees attending company-required classes commencing and ending after their regular
workday hours, will be paid overtime wages for time spent in class beyond their regular 40-hour
work week.

--- Any courses pursued for personal development, which are not company mandated, can be
considered to be financed through the company, but hourly wages will not be paid to the employee
for their time.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_24_2.png)

## 127. Paid Time OFF (PTO)

Paid Time Off (PTO) is an all-purpose time-off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation,
illness or injury, and personal business. It combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into
one flexible, paid time-off policy. Employees in the following employment classification(s) are
eligible to earn and use PTO as described in this policy:

--- Regular full-time employees

Once employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to accrue PTO according
to the schedule below. Accrued PTO is available for use immediately after accrual. PTO can be
used in minimum increments of one-half hour.

The employee’s accrued balance will be capped at the maximum PTO balance amount listed in
the PTO schedule. PTO accrued in excess of this maximum balance amount will be lost.

Note: The amount of PTO accrued increases with the length of employment, as shown in the
following schedule:

Months of Eligible
Service Completed

PTO Hours Accrued
Per Week

Annual Rate of PTO
Accrual (Hours)

Maximum PTO
Balance (Hours)

0 0 0 3 1. 54 80 36 2. 00 104 120 2. 31 120 180 2. 62 136 240 3. 38 176 300 4. 15 216 The length of eligible service is calculated based on a "benefit year." This is the 12-month period
that begins when the employee starts to earn PTO. An employee's benefit year may be extended
for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. Military leave has no effect
on this calculation (see individual leave of absence policies for more information.)

REQUESTS FOR PTO WAGES AND APPROVAL:

To schedule planned PTO of less than 5 consecutive working days, employees must submit a
PTO request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 2 weeks of advance notice.

| | | | | | | | | | | | |
|-----|--------------------|--|------|-------------------|--|-----|--------------------|--|-----|-----------------|--|
| | Months of Eligible | | | PTO Hours Accrued | | | Annual Rate of PTO | | | Maximum PTO | |

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_25_2.png)

To schedule planned PTO of 5 or more consecutive working days, employees must submit a PTO
request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 4 weeks of advance notice.

Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing
requirements. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted as
requested.

Employees who have an unexpected need to be absent from work must notify their Supervisor
before the start of the workday. If additional days of absence are then required, the employee
must notify their Supervisor every additional day before the start of the workday with a phone call.
An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted, even in the case of
emergency.

PTO PAY RATES:

PTO is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence. It does not include overtime
or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift
differentials. PTO cannot be used in combination with base time to earn more than 40 hours per
week.

PTO must be entered into the employee’s timecard for the affected week. PTO not recorded on
a timecard will not be awarded/paid.

PTO is a “use-it-or-lose-it” benefit. Unused PTO will not be paid out to an employee for any
reason.

If an employee resigns and returns to employment at JH&A on later date, their eligibility for paid
time off benefits will revert to that of a new employee.

Personal time off without pay, family leave and Military Leave will have an effect on the calculation
of accumulated PTO. Accumulation of PTO stops when an employee is absent during personal
time off.

## 128. Health Insurance

JH&A's health insurance plan provides employees and their dependents access to medical
insurance benefits. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to
participate in the health insurance plan:

--- Regular full-time employees

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_26_2.png)

Eligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions
of the agreement between JH&A and the insurance carrier.

A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the
health insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) policy
for more information.

Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An
SPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible
employees. Contact the Administrative Office for more information about health insurance
benefits.

## 129. Timekeeping

Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and
state laws require JH&A to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee
pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties.

Hourly nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work,
as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the
beginning and ending time of any departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must
always be approved before it is performed.

Time sheets are available in the office. If a specific day's time sheet is not available, employees
should inform the office personnel immediately.

It is the employee's responsibility to tum in their timecard on a timely basis. Failure to do so could
result in a delay of pay.

A time sheet must be turned in even when the employee is on vacation, out sick, or taking
personal time off. The time sheet should be marked with an explanation of the absence.

It is the employee's responsibility to sign their time sheet to certify the accuracy of all time
recorded. Office personnel will review the time record for accuracy before payroll processing. If
an employee has not correctly documented his or her time, corrections will be made in the total
hours worked, according to the stop and start times recorded.

Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time
record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_27_2.png)

## 130. Paydays

All employees are paid weekly. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed
through the end of the previous payroll period. Our payroll period runs from Wednesday to
Tuesday.

In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a holiday, employees
will receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday, unless the office
personnel are unable to complete payroll due to unforeseen circumstances. In such case,
employees will receive pay on the first day of work after the regularly scheduled payday.

If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee may receive his or her
earned wages before departing for vacation if a written request is submitted to the office at least
one week prior to departing for vacation.

## 131. Employment Terminations

Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and
many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common
circumstances under which employment is terminated:

--- Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee.

--- Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization.

--- Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for non-
disciplinary reasons.

Since employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent, both the employee and JH&A have
the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time. Employees will
receive their final pay in accordance with applicable state law.

Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. All
accrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid. Some benefits may
be continued at the employee's expense if the employee so chooses. The employee will be
notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations
of such continuance.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_28_2.png)

## 132. On-Call Pay

All field technicians are provided with on-call stipends in the instance of being required to report
to work on weekends. All notice of potential work should be provided by management to the
employee(s) by the afternoon prior in order to allow for the employee to have adequate
preparation.

## 133. Administrative Pay Corrections

JH&A takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in
each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday.

In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly
bring the discrepancy to the attention of Management so that corrections can be made as quickly
as possible.

## 134. Pay Deductions and Setoffs

The law requires that JH&A make certain deductions from every employee's compensation.
Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. JH&A also must deduct Social
Security taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security
"wage base." JH&A matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee.

JH&A offers programs and benefits beyond those required by law. Eligible employees may
voluntarily authorize deductions from their pay checks to cover the costs of participation in these
programs.

Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by JH&A, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to JH&A
or others.

Certain pay deductions, such as wage garnishments, credit union and insurance plans, art
directed by law and cannot be altered by JH&A. Even though an employee may work a limited
number of hours in a given payroll week, specific deductions must be made. Employees cannot
choose to cancel certain deductions for a specific payroll period. If an employee does not have
enough earned wages to support such a required payroll deduction, the deduction may be taken
in the following weeks until the obligation is paid.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_29_2.png)

If you have questions concerning why deductions were made from your pay check or how they
were calculated, your supervisor can assist in having your questions answered.

## 135. Safety

To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and
visitors, JH&A has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for
JH&A. Management is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating
the safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.

An M.S.D.S. application (Material Safety Data Sheets) for materials and chemicals used in our
workplace is also provided on smart devices in each vehicle. Employees may view the Safety
Program Manual or the digital M.S.D.S. sheets at any time, and are responsible for maintaining
access via single sign on through the provided application.

JH&A provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through
regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board
postings, memos, or other written communications.

Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers
potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or
minimize hazards.

Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns,
or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their
supervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the President.
Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal.

Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.
Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.
Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who
fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment.

In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear,
employees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor. Such reports
are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance and workers' compensation benefits
procedures.

## 136. Work Schedules

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_30_2.png)

The normal work schedule for all employees is 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Supervisors will
advise employees of the times their schedules will normally begin and end. Staffing needs and
operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations
in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week.

## 137. Use of Phone System & Cell Phones

Personal use of a company telephone for long-distance and toll calls is not permitted. Employees
should practice discretion when making local personal calls and may be required to reimburse
JH&A for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone.

Use of cell phones for personal calls during regular working hours is not permitted.

Employees should practice discretion and inform their family and friends of the company's policy
regarding this issue. Personal use of cell phones could lead to suspension and termination.

Employees who have been assigned a cell phone will use it only for official company business.

To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always employ customer
service best practices.

## 138. Smoking

In keeping with JH&A's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking in the
workplace is discouraged. Nonsmoking areas are clearly designated where smoking is expressly
prohibited, and employees are asked to respect these designations. In situations where the
preferences of smokers and nonsmokers are in direct conflict, the preferences of nonsmokers will
prevail.

A customer may prohibit smoking on his property. In these situations, the customer’s preference
will prevail; smoking will not be allowed, except inside the company's vehicle. Smoking in the attic,
under or inside the home of a customer is strictly prohibited, as is discarding cigarette butts,
cigarette packages, or lighters.

This policy applies equally to all employees, customers, and visitors.

## 139. Meal Periods

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_31_2.png)

All full-time regular employees are provided with one meal period of 30 minutes in length each
workday. Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements.
Employees will be relieved of all active responsibilities and restrictions during meal periods and
will not be compensated for that time.

A minimum of a 15 minute meal period is required of all employees each day.

## 140. Overtime

When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours,
employees may be scheduled to work overtime hours. When possible, advance notification of
these mandatory assignments will be provided. All overtime work must receive the supervisor's
prior authorization.

Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as practical to all employees qualified to
perform the required work.

Overtime compensation is paid to all nonexempt employees in accordance with federal and state
wage and hour restrictions.

Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. JH&A's overtime pay rate is regular hourly wage
(x) 1.5. Overtime pay is general paid for time worked over 40 hours per payroll week, with the
following exception: Employees will always be paid overtime for hours worked on Sunday.

Failure to work assigned overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including possible
termination of employment.

## 141. Use of Equipment and Vehicles

COMPANY-SUPPLIED TOOLS & EQUIPMENT:

Tools & Equipment essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to
replace. When using tools, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required
maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines.

Please notify the supervisor if any equipment, machines, or tools appear to be damaged,
defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs
could prevent deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or others. Tool &
Equipment are to be used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and certain pieces of
equipment such as refrigerant vacuum pumps and recovery machines require specific

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_32_2.png)

maintenance. The supervisor can answer any questions about an employee's responsibility for
maintenance and care of equipment used on the job.

Some personally owned tools may be required for employment and use during work hours. Proper
upkeep, care, and maintenance and care of personal tools is expected.

The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment can result
in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Each employee who has been assigned a vehicle will be given a list of company-supplied tools &
equipment. The employee will be required to sign the list, verifying the items are on the truck. A
copy of this form will be kept in the office. Periodic inspections will be made to assure that each
vehicle contains the items, and employees will be held accountable if the items are not found on
the vehicle.

COMPANY VEHICLES:

Likewise, vehicles are expensive and essential pieces of property in any business. Care &
maintenance is required by all employees. Improper use, carelessness, and unsafe operation of
any company vehicle (including excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations) will result in
termination of employment.

Employees will be required to make a monthly assessment of the operating condition of their
assigned vehicles. This assessment will be in the form of a report, to be filled out as requested
during one of JH&A's weekly meetings.

All company vehicles shall have typical maintenance performed every 3 months, as directed by
the company and manufacturer’s guidelines, at a local service center. Employees may be asked
to assist in performing the maintenance items.

Periodic service check-up reports are posted for all vehicles. The employee assigned to a vehicle
will be held responsible for its safety and maintenance. Specifically, when a vehicle report is
posted for a service interval, the employee assigned to the vehicle will be held responsible to get
it performed. The employee should contact the office to schedule the service.

The following policies apply to all employees who drive a company vehicle:

1. Company vehicles shall be used only for company-related business, driven back & forthto the work site, and not used for personal business.

1. When not in use a company vehicle will be locked and kept safe and secure in the JH&Aparking lot, or on the employee's premises (if driven home at night).

1. No one except JH&A employees shall be allowed to drive or use a company-ownedvehicle.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_33_2.png)

1. If an employee is involved in an accident or any traffic incident, he must immediately reportit to the office. In almost every case, the employee may be required to wait at the accident
site until the police arrive and a police report is filed. In all cases, the employees involved
will be required to fully cooperate with the patrol man and insurance company
investigations.

1. Likewise, if an employee receives a traffic citation or parking ticket, it must be immediatelyreported to his supervisor. All parking tickets must be turned into the office the same day.
## 142. Use of Company Supplied Vehicle

Specific Requirements for Service Technicians

Service Technicians and the use of their company-assigned vehicle fall under a special provision
in the Employee Handbook.

It is JH&A's policy to give each Service Technician the choice of either driving his assigned vehicle
back and forth to his home each work day, or leaving it at the Jacob Heating & Air parking lot
each night. A form indicating the employee's choice will be given to each Service Technician for
his signature. A copy will be placed in the employee's personnel file.

The company's position on this matter is that the employee should be aware he does not need to
provide his own vehicle to drive to work, and he does not pay gas, insurance or wear and tear on
his own vehicle.

If the Service Technician chooses to drive the company vehicle home, his wages will begin when
he is dispatched to his first call of the day. The employee’s wages will end when he completes his
last call of the day, unless he is outside a 10-mile radius of his home. In such case, the employee
will be paid until crossing the 10-mile radius.

Drive time from the employee's home to the shop for a Company meeting or training session will
not be compensated.

When the Service Technician is "on-call" and is required to leave his home for an emergency
service call, wages will be paid from the employee's home to the customer and drive time back.

A Service Technician who is officially "on-call" will be paid a flat On-Call Bonus of $75.00 per
week. This bonus pay is defined as compensation for being paged by the Answering Service and
returning phone calls to the customers, whether any pages or phone calls are actually received
or not.

VEHICLE MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES: Service Technicians who choose to drive their
company-assigned vehicle home will be required to fulfill the following responsibilities.

---

the way home from work in the evening.

1. Once a week the service tech is required to wash the vehicle, cleanout the interior, checkall fluid levels and tire pressure, and perform a safety check.

1. Every 3 months the service tech is required to have the vehicle fully serviced, including oilchanged and filter, have the tires rotated, and any other regular maintenance item needed.

## 143. Emergency Closings

At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or hurricanes, can disrupt
company operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of the work
facility at JH&A.

When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled
work will be unpaid. However, with supervisory approval, employees may use available paid leave
time, such as unused vacation benefits.

If an emergency closing is not authorized, and JH&A remains open, employees who fail to report
for work will not be paid for the time off.

Employees in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are officially
closed. In these circumstances, employees who work will receive regular pay.

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_38_2.png)

## 144. Business Travel Expenses

JH&A will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on
assignments away from the normal work location. All business travel must be approved in
advance by the Controller.

Employees whose travel plans have been approved are responsible for making their own travel
arrangements.

When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other expenses directly related to
accomplishing business travel objectives will be reimbursed by JH&A. Employees are expected
to limit expenses to reasonable amounts.

Employees who are involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report the
incident to their immediate supervisor. Vehicles owned, leased, or rented by JH&A may not be
used for personal use without prior approval.

Cash advances to cover reasonable anticipated expenses may be made to employees, after
travel has been approved. Employees should submit a written request to their supervisor when
travel advances are needed.

When travel is completed, employees should submit completed travel expense repot1s within days.

Reports should be accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses.

Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related to
travel arrangements, travel advances, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses, or
any other business travel issues.

Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including falsifying expense reports to reflect costs
not incurred by the employee, can be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

## 145. Visitors in the Workplace

To provide for the safety and security of employees and the facilities at JH&A, only authorized
visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety
standards, protects against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects confidential information,
safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_39_2.png)

All visitors should enter Jacob Sheet Metal Works or Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning at the main
entrance. Authorized visitors will receive directions or be escorted to their destination. Employees
are responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors.

If an unauthorized individual is observed on company premises, employees should immediately
notify their supervisor or, if necessary, direct the individual to the main entrance.

## 146. Computer and E-mail Usage

Computers, computer files, the e-mail system, and software furnished to employees are JH&A
property intended for business use. Employees should not use a password, access a file, or
retrieve any stored communication without authorization. To ensure compliance with this policy,
computer and e-mail usage may be monitored.

JH&A strives to maintain a workplace free of harassment and sensitive to the diversity of its
employees. Therefore, JH&A prohibits the use of computers and the e-mail system in ways that
are disruptive, offensive to others, or harmful to morale.

For example, the display or transmission of sexually explicit images, messages, and cartoons is
not allowed. Other such misuse includes, but is not limited to, ethnic slurs, racial comments,
potentially offensive, or anything that may be construed as harassment or showing disrespect for
others.

E-mail may not be used to solicit others for commercial ventures, religious or political causes,
outside organizations, or other non-business matters.

Employees should notify their supervisor, the President or any member of management upon
learning of violations of this policy. Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary·
action, up to and including termination of employment.

## 147. Workplace Monitoring

Workplace monitoring may be conducted by JH&A to ensure quality control, employee safety,
security, and customer satisfaction.

Computers furnished to employees are the property of JH&A. As such, computer usage and files
may be monitored or accessed.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_40_2.png)

JH&A may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. Video monitoring is used
to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage
or prevent acts of harassment and workplace violence.

Because JH&A is sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of employees, every effort will be made
to guarantee that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner.

## 148. Workplace Violence Prevention

JH&A is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment.
Given the increasing violence in society in general, JH&A has adopted the following guidelines to
deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence that may occur during
business hours or on its premises.

All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, should be treated with courtesy
and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay," or other
conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous
devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of JH&A without proper authorization.

Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, or a member of
the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all
acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any
characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible
to your immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by
employees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public.
When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible.

All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor.
Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work
station, do not try to intercede or see what is happening.

JH&A will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence and of
suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected
as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation,
JH&A may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation.

Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in
violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_41_2.png)

JH&A encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the
attention of their supervisors or Management before the situation escalates into potential violence.
JH&A is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees
for raising such concerns.

## 149. Medical Leave

JH&A provides medical leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who are temporarily
unable to work due to a serious health condition or disability. For purposes of this policy, serious
health conditions or disabilities include inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical
care facility; continuing treatment by a health care provider; and temporary disabilities associated
with pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions.

Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request medical leave as
described in this policy.

--- Regular full-time employees

Eligible employees may request medical leave only after having completed 365 calendar days of
service. Exceptions to the service requirement will be considered to accommodate disabilities.

Eligible employees should make requests for medical leave to their supervisors at least 30 days
in advance of foreseeable events and as soon as possible for unforeseeable events.

A health care provider's statement must be submitted verifying the need for medical leave and its
beginning and expected ending dates. Any changes in this information should be promptly
reported to JH&A. Employees returning from medical leave must submit a health care provider's
verification of their fitness to return to work.

Eligible employees are normally granted leave for the period of the disability, up to a maximum of
6 weeks within any 12-month period. Any combination of medical leave and family leave may not
exceed this maximum limit. If the initial period of approved absence proves insufficient,
consideration will be given to a request for an extension. Employees will be required to first use
any accrued paid leave time before taking unpaid medical leave.

Employees who sustain work-related injuries are eligible for a medical leave of absence for the
period of disability in accordance with all applicable laws covering occupational disabilities.

Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits
will be provided by JH&A until the end of the month in which the medical leave begins. At that
time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_42_2.png)

lo continue. When the employee returns from medical leave, benefits will again be provided by
JH&A according to the applicable plans.

The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during
the leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as Dental, AFLAC, and disability
plans must continue to be paid by our company in order for the plans to stay in effect. Employees
taking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A while off work. Every effort will be
made to keep these supplemental plans in force.

Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the
leave and will resume upon return to active employment.

So that an employee's return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on medical leave
is requested to provide JH&A with at least two weeks’ advance notice of the date the employee
intends to return to work. When a medical leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same
position, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified. .

If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed upon return date, JH&A will assume that the
employee has resigned.

## 150. Family Leave

JH&A provides family leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time
off from work duties to fulfill family obligations relating directly to childbirth, adoption, or placement
of a foster child; or to care for a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition. A serious
health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves
inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or continuing treatment
by a health care provider.

Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request family leave as
described in this policy:

--- Regular full-time employees

Employees requesting family leave related to the serious health condition of a child, spouse, or
parent may be required to submit a health care provider's statement verifying the need for a family
leave to provide care, its beginning and expected ending dates, and the estimated time required.

The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during
the leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as Dental, AFLAC, and disability
plans must continue to be paid by our company in order for the plans to stay in effect. Employees

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_43_2.png)

taking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A while off work. Every effort will be
made to keep these supplemental plans in force.

Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the
leave and will resume upon return to active employment.

So that an employee's return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on family leave is
requested to provide JH&A with at least two weeks’ advance notice of the date the employee
intends to return to work. When a family leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same
position, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified.

If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed upon return date, JH&A will assume that the
employee has resigned.

## 151. Personal & Bereavement Leave

JH&A will consider leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off
from work duties to fulfill personal obligations. Employees in the following employment
classification(s) are eligible to request personal leave as described in this policy:

--- Regular full-time employees

Eligible employees may request personal leave only after having completed 90 calendar days of
service. As soon as eligible employees become aware of the need for a personal leave of
absence, they should request a leave from Management.

Personal leave may be granted for a period of not to exceed 5 calendar days per one-year period.
If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request
for a single extension of no more than 3 calendar days. With the supervisor's approval, an
employee must take any available vacation paid time off first as part of the approved period.

Requests for personal leave will be evaluated based on a number of factors, including anticipated
work load requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence.
Employees should not assume they will be granted their request for personal time off.

Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits
will be provided by Il-I&A until the end of the month in which the approved personal leave begins.
At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish
coverage to continue. When the employee returns from personal leave, benefits will again be
provided by JH&A according to the-applicable plans.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_44_2.png)

The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during
the leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as AFLAC, dental, and disability
plans must continue to be paid by the Company in order for the plan to stay in effect. Employees
taking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A in such cases. Every effort will be
made to keep these supplemental plans in force.

Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the
leave and will resume upon return to active employment.

When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the
same position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified.
However, JH&A cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases.

If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period,
JH&A will assume the employee has resigned.

Each employee is eligible for bereavement leave of up to 3 business days for direct family
(parents, siblings, grandparents, children). Bereavement leave does not apply to non-direct family
members, and PTO usage would be required for anyone outside of these parameters.

## 152. Employee Conduct and Work Rules

To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, JH&A expects
employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and
the organization.

It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace.
The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment:

--- Unsafe or negligent operation of company-owned vehicles.

--- Excessive traffic violations.

--- Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property

--- Falsification of timekeeping records

--- Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs

--- Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace,
while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment

Employment with JH&A is at the mutual consent of JH&A and the employee, and either party may
terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.

## 153. Drug and Alcohol Use

It is JH&A's desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal,
employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform
their jobs in a satisfactory manner.

While on JH&A premises and while conducting business-related activities off JH&A premises, no
employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.
The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's
ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not
endanger other individuals in the workplace.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_46_2.png)

Violations this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of
employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment
program. Such violations may also have legal consequences.

To inform employees about important provisions of this policy, JH&A has established a drug-free
awareness program. The program provides information on the dangers and effects of substance
abuse in the workplace, resources available to employees, and consequences for violations of
this policy.

Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged
to use the resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these
matters with their supervisor or the President to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate
resources in the community.

Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate
subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a
rehabilitation or treatment program through JH&A's health insurance benefit coverage. Leave may
be granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all
JH&A policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the
leave will not cause JH&A any undue hardship.

Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace
should raise their concerns with their supervisor or the President without fear of reprisal.

## 154. Sexual and Other Unlawful
## Harassment

JH&A is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful
harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity,
age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. As an example,
sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of employee misconduct that is demeaning
to another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly
prohibited.

Any employee who wants to report an incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment should
promptly report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the employee
believes it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately
contact the President or any other member of management. Employees can raise concerns and
make reports without fear of reprisal.

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_47_2.png)

Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment
should promptly advise the President or any member of management who will handle the matter
in a timely and confidential manner.

Anyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including termination of employment.

## 155. Attendance and Punctuality

To maintain a safe and productive work environment, JH&A expects employees to be reliable and
to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. Absenteeism and tardiness places a burden on
other employees and on JH&A. In the rare instance when an employee cannot avoid being late
to work or is unable to work as scheduled, he or she must notify their supervisor as soon as
possible. It is imperative to notify the office staff, as well as the manager, in order to minimize
business disruption.

Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Either may lead to disciplinary action, up
to and including termination of employment.

## 156. Personal Appearance

Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees
and affect the business image JH&A presents to customers and visitors.

During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to
dress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work
inappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in proper attire. Under
such circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work.

issued by Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning and branded accordingly.

resignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits.

JH&A wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms,
explosives, or other improper materials. To this end, JH&A prohibits the possession, transfer,
sale, or use of such materials on its premises. JH&A requires the cooperation of all employees in
administering this policy.

Company vehicles, desks, drawers, bins, and other storage devices may be provided for the
convenience of employees but remain the sole property of JH&A. Accordingly, they, as well as
any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or representative of JH&A at any
time, either with or without prior notice.

JH&A likewise wishes to discourage theft or unauthorized possession of the property of
employees, JH&A, visitors, and customers. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, JH&A or its
representative may inspect not only company vehicles, desks, and drawers but also persons
entering and/or leaving the premises and any packages or other belongings. Any employee who

wishes to avoid inspection of any articles or materials should not bring such items onto JH&A's
premises.

## 160. Solicitation

In an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by
JH&A may not solicit or distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose.

JH&A recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the
workplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities
during working time. (Working time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other
periods in which employees are not on duty.)

In addition, the posting of written solicitations on company bulletin boards is restricted. These
bulletin boards display important information, and employees should consult them frequently for:

--- Employee announcements

--- Internal memoranda

--- Organization announcements

--- Workers' compensation insurance information

--- State disability insurance/unemployment insurance information.

If employees have a message of interest to the workplace, they may submit it to the Controller for
approval. All approved messages will be posted by the Controller.

## 161. Drug Testing

JH&A is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all
employees. Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious
safety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants
and employees may be asked to provide body substance samples (such as urine and/or blood)
to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, in a case where a Worker’s
Comp claim is submitted, drug or alcohol screening may be required. Refusal to submit to drug
testing may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides confidential counseling and referral services
to employees for assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. It is

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_51_2.png)

the employee's responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP prior to reaching a point where his
or her judgment, performance, or behavior has led to imminent disciplinary action. Participation
in the EAP after the disciplinary process has begun may not preclude disciplinary action, up to
and including termination of employment.

Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all employees. Employees will be asked to
sign an acknowledgement form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy.
Questions concerning this policy or its administration should be directed to the Controller.

## 162. Progressive Discipline

The purpose of this policy is to stale JH&A's position on administering equitable and consistent
discipline for unsatisfacto1y conduct in the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one
that does not have to be enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all
employment levels.

JH&A's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain
that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary
action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory
service in the future.

Although employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent and both the employee and JH&A
have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, JH&A
may use progressive discipline at its discretion.

Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension
with or without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and
the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.

Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will
normally be followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed
by a written warning; another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may
then lead to termination of employment.

JH&A recognizes that there are certain types of employee problems that are serious enough to
justify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going
through the usual progressive discipline steps.

While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be deemed a serious offense, the
Employee Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in
immediate suspension or termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all

---

![heating & air conditioning ‘since](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/FieldServiceTechnicians_Jacob_Heating_and_Cooling_image_52_2.png)

necessarily serious offenses, but may be examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger
progressive discipline.

By using progressive discipline, we hope that most employee problems can be corrected at an
early stage, benefiting both the employee and JH&A.

## 163. Life-Threatening Illnesses in the
## Workplace

Employees with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to
continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. JH&A
supports these endeavors as long as employees are able to meet acceptable performance
standards and don’t pose a health risk to other employees. As in the case of other disabilities,
JH&A will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal

requirements, to allow qualified employees with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential
functions of their jobs.

Medical information on individual employees is treated confidentially. JH&A will take reasonable
precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other
employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of employee medical
information.

Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.
