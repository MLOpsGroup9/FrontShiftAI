**H** **ANDBOOK** **P** **URPOSE**
This employee handbook is presented as a matter of information and has been prepared
to inform employees about the Company’s philosophy, employment practices, policies,
and the benefits provided to our valued employees, as well as the conduct expected from
them. While this handbook is not intended to be a book of rules and regulations or a

---

contract, it does include some important guidelines which employees should know.
Except for the at-will employment provisions, the handbook can be amended at any time.

This employee handbook will not answer every question employees may have, nor would
the Company want to restrict the normal question and answer interchange among us. It
is in our person-to-person conversations that we can better know each other, express our
views, and work together in a harmonious relationship.

We hope this guide will help employees feel comfortable with us. The Company depends
on its employees; their success is our success. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions.
Every manager will gladly answer them. We believe employees will enjoy their work and
their fellow employees here. We also believe that employees will find the Company a
good place to work.

No one other than authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this
employee handbook. No statement or promise by a supervisor, manager, or designee is
to be interpreted as a change in policy, nor will it constitute an agreement with an
employee.

Should any provision in this employee handbook be found to be unenforceable and
invalid, such a finding does not invalidate the entire employee handbook, but only the
subject provision. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights
under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or be incompatible with the
NLRA.

We ask that employees read this guide carefully, become familiar with the Company and
our policies, and refer to it whenever questions arise.

- Sex
- Sexual orientation

- Any other protected class, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and locallaws

The Company takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and
retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training,
promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence and termination.

---

**B** **ACKGROUND** **C** **HECKS**
The Company may conduct a background check on any applicant or employee with their
signed consent. The background check may consist of prior employment verification,
reference checks, education confirmation, criminal background, credit history, or other
information, as permitted by law. Third-party services may be hired to perform these
checks. All offers of employment and continued employment are contingent upon a
satisfactory background check. Refusal to consent to a background check may result in
discipline, up to or including termination.

**A** **T** **-W** **ILL** **N** **OTICE**
The employment relationship between the Company and employees is at-will. This means
that employees are not hired for any specified period of time and their employment may
be terminated at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either
the Company or the employee. Company policy requires that all employees are at-will;
any implied, oral, or written agreements or promises to the contrary are void and
unenforceable, unless approved by an officer with the power to create an employment
contract. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other
Company document or written or verbal statement or policy.

**A** **NNIVERSARY** **D** **ATE AND** **S** **ENIORITY**
The employee’s date of hire is their official employment anniversary date. Seniority is the
length of continuous service starting on that date. Should an employee leave the
Company and then be rehired, previously accrued seniority will be lost and seniority will
begin to accrue again on the date of rehire. With the exception of certain protected leaves
and paid time off, seniority does not accrue during leaves of absence that exceed calendar days.

**I** **MMIGRATION** **L** **AW** **C** **OMPLIANCE**
All employees are required to complete Section 1 of Form I-9 on their first day of
employment, and produce, within three business days, acceptable proof of their identity
and eligibility to work in the United States. Failure to produce the proper identifying
documents within three days will result in termination.

**I** **NTRODUCTORY** **P** **ERIOD**
The employee's first 90 days of employment with the Company are considered an
introductory period. This introductory period will be a time for getting to know fellow
employees, managers and the tasks involved in the position, as well as becoming familiar
with the Company's products and services. The supervisor or manager will work closely
with each employee to help them understand the needs and processes of their job.

This introductory period is a try-out time for the employee and the Company. During this
introductory period, the Company will evaluate employees' suitability for employment
and employees can evaluate the Company as well. At any time during this first 90 days,
employees may resign. If, during this period, employee work habits, attitude, attendance,

---

performance or other relevant factors do not measure up to our standards, the Company
may terminate employment.

At the end of the introductory period, the supervisor or manager will discuss each
employee's job performance with them. During the course of the discussion, employees
are encouraged to give their comments and ideas as well.

Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment for any
specified period of time, nor does it require that an employee be discharged only for
cause. Completion of the introductory period also does not imply that employees now
have a contract of employment with the Company, other than at-will. Successful
completion of the introductory period does not alter the at-will employment relationship.

A former employee who has been rehired after a separation from the Company of more
than one year is considered an introductory employee during their first 90 days following
rehire.

**E** **MPLOYMENT** **C** **LASSIFICATIONS**
The Company has established the following employee classifications for compensation
and benefit purposes only. An employee's supervisor or manager will inform the
employee of their classification, status, and responsibilities at the time of hire, re-hire,
promotion or at any time a change in status occurs. These classifications do not alter the
employment at-will status.

Regular Full-Time Employee
An employee who is regularly scheduled to work no less than 30 hours/week. The
employee may be exempt or non-exempt and is generally eligible for all employment
benefits offered by the Company.

Regular Part-Time Employee
An employee who is regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours in a workweek and
may be eligible for some benefits.

Temporary Employee
An employee who is scheduled to work on a specific need of the Company. The employee
will not receive any benefits unless specifically authorized in writing.

Exempt
Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards
Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements.
The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours
required to meet their work responsibilities.

---

Non-Exempt
Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid
a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked. Unless notified
otherwise in writing by management, all employees of the Company are non-exempt.

**P** **ERSONNEL** **R** **ECORDS**
The Company maintains various employment files while an individual remains an
employee of the Company. Such files may include employee personnel files, attendance
files, I-9 files, and files for medical purposes. Employees are required to notify their
manager should any of their personal information change (e.g., address, phone number,
last name) so the appropriate updates can be made to the files. The Company will take
reasonable precautions to protect employee files and employees' personally identifiable
information in its records.

Employee files are restricted based on who reasonably needs access to all or parts of the
files. Employees may review their own personnel file by making a written request to their
manager or Human Resources. The written request will become a part of the employee's
personnel file. Review of files must take place in the presence of the employee's manager
or Human Resources.

**E** **MPLOYEE** **R** **EFERENCES**
All employee reference check requests should be forwarded to Human Resources; only
authorized members of management or Human Resources may provide this information.
When the Company is contacted for a reference check or employment verification,
generally only positions held and dates of employment will be confirmed. In some
circumstances, past salary and eligibility for rehire may be provided as well.

**J** **OB** **T** **RANSFERS**
The Company aspires to promote qualified internal candidates to fill open positions
whenever possible and practical. When job openings occur, current employees are
encouraged to apply.

Management reserves the right to place an employee in whatever job it deems useful or
necessary. All job transfers, reassignments, promotions, or lateral transfers are at the
discretion of the Company.

---

**CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR**

**G** **ENERAL** **C** **ONDUCT** **G** **UIDELINES**
Employees are expected to exercise common sense and courtesy at all times, for the
benefit of clients, co-workers, and the Company as a whole. Professionalism is expected,
as is respect for the safety and security of people and property. Failure to meet these
expectations may be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination. The
following are examples of unacceptable conduct, but this is not an exhaustive list.

- Theft, misappropriation, or unauthorized possession or use of any property thatdoes not belong to the employee.

---

- Illegal gambling on Company premises.
- Soliciting, collecting money, vending, and posting or distributing bills or pamphletsduring working hours in work areas. Such activity by employees during non-working
time, including meal and rest periods, is not restricted so long as such activity does
not interfere with the regular operation of business, is orderly, lawful, in good taste,
conducted in an orderly manner, and does not create a safety hazard or a mess. Non-
employees are prohibited from all forms of solicitation on Company property at all
times.

**S** **EXUAL AND** **O** **THER** **U** **NLAWFUL** **H** **ARASSMENT**
The Company is committed to providing a work environment free of harassment in any
form, including inappropriate and disrespectful behavior, intimidation, and other
unwelcome conduct directed at an individual because of their inclusion in a protected
class. Applicable federal and state law defines harassment as unwelcome behavior based
on someone's inclusion in a protected class. Sometimes language or actions that were not
expected to be offensive or unwelcome actually are, so employees should err on the side
of being more sensitive to the feelings of their co-workers rather than less.

The following are examples of harassment; behaviors not in this list may also be
considered harassment:

- Unwanted sexual advances;
- Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;
- Retaliation or threats of retaliation for refusing advances or requests for favors;
- Leering, making sexual gestures or jokes, or commenting on an employee's body;
- Displaying sexually suggestive content;
- Displaying or sharing derogatory posters, photographs, or drawings;
- Making derogatory epithets, or slurs;
- Ongoing teasing about an employee's religious or cultural practices;
- Ongoing teasing about an employee's sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity;
- Physical conduct such as touching, assault, or impeding or blocking movements
Sexual harassment on the job is unlawful whether it involves coworker harassment,
harassment by a manager, or harassment by persons doing business with or for the
Company, such as clients, customers or vendors.

Retaliation
Any form of retaliation against someone who has expressed concern about any form of
harassment, refused to partake in harassing behavior, made a harassment complaint, or
cooperated in a harassment investigation, is strictly prohibited. A complaint made in good
faith will under no circumstances be grounds for disciplinary action. Individuals who make
complaints that they know to be false may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.

---

Enforcement
All managers and supervisors are responsible for:

- Implementing the Company's harassment policy;
- Ensuring that all employees they supervise have knowledge of and understand theCompany policy;

- Reporting any complaints of misconduct to the designated company representative,the HR Manager, so they may be investigated and resolved internally;

- Taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when necessaryto ensure compliance with the policy; and

- Conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the policy.
Addressing Issues Informally
Employees who witness offensive behavior in the workplace - whether directed at them
or another employee - are encouraged, though not required, to immediately address it
with the employee whose behavior they found offensive. An employee who is informed
that their behavior is or was offensive should stop immediately and refrain from that
behavior in the future, regardless of whether they agree that the behavior could have
been offensive.

Harassment Complaint Procedure
Employees are encouraged to use the Complaint Procedure to report behavior that they
feel is harassing, whether or not that behavior is directed at them. The Complaint
Procedure provides for immediate, thorough, and objective investigation of claims of
harassment. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against those who are
determined to have engaged in harassing behavior.

**A** **BUSIVE** **C** **ONDUCT**
Abusive conduct means malicious conduct in the workplace that a reasonable person
would find hostile or offensive and unrelated to an employer’s legitimate business
interests. Abusive conduct may include repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the
use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets, verbal or physical conduct that a
reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating, or the sabotage
or undermining of a person’s work performance. A single act will generally not constitute
abusive conduct, unless especially severe.

The Company considers abusive conduct in the workplace unacceptable and will not
tolerate it under any circumstances. Employees should report abusive conduct to a
manager or Human Resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that employees are
not subjected to abusive conduct. All reports will be treated seriously and investigated
when appropriate. Employees who are found to have engaged in abusive conduct will be
subject to discipline, up to and potentially including termination. Retaliation against an
employee who reports abusive conduct or verifies that it took place is strictly prohibited.

---

**C** **OMPLAINT** **P** **ROCEDURE**
The Company has established a procedure for a fair review of complaints related to any
workplace controversy, conflict, or harassment. Employees may take their complaint
directly to the person or department listed in Step 2 if the complaint is related to their
supervisor or manager or if the employee feels the supervisor or manager would not
provide an impartial resolution to the problem.

Step The complaint should be submitted orally or in writing to a supervisor or manager within
three working days of the incident or as soon as possible. Sooner is better, as it will assist
in a more accurate investigation, but complaints will be taken seriously regardless of
when they are reported. Generally, a meeting will be held within three business days of
the employee's request, depending upon scheduling availability. Attempts will be made
to resolve the issue during the meeting, but regardless of whether there is an immediate
resolution, the supervisor or manager will give the employee a written summary of the
meeting within three business days. Resolution may take longer if further investigation of
the complaint is required. If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution, they may
proceed to Step 2.

Step The employee may submit an oral or written request for review of the complaint and Step
1 resolution to the HR Manager or a designated investigator. This request should be made
within three working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The HR Manager
or the designated investigator will review the complaint and resolution and may call an
additional meeting to explore the problem. If warranted, additional fact-finding will be
undertaken. A final decision will be rendered within 10 working days after receiving the
Step 2 request, and a written summary of the resolution will be provided to the employee
who filed the complaint.

**C** **ORRECTIVE** **A** **CTION**
A high level of job performance and professionalism is expected from each employee. In
the event that an employee’s job performance does not meet the standards established
for the position, they violate company policies or procedures, or their behavior is
otherwise unacceptable, corrective action may ensue. Corrective action may include, but
is not limited to: coaching, oral or written warnings, performance improvement plans,
paid or unpaid suspension, demotion, and termination. The type and order of actions
taken will be at management's sole discretion and the Company is not required to take
any disciplinary action before making an adverse employment decision, including
termination.

---

**COMPENSATION**

**P** **AY** **P** **ERIODS**
The standard seven-day payroll workweek for the Company will begin at 12:00 a.m.
Sunday. The designated pay period for all employees is weekly. Paydays are every Friday.
Except as otherwise provided, if any date of paycheck distribution falls on a holiday,
employees will be paid on the preceding scheduled workday.

**T** **IMEKEEPING** **(** **NON** --- **EXEMPT EMPLOYEES** **)**
All non-exempt employees are required to use the timekeeping system to record their
hours worked. For the purpose of this policy, all forms of timekeeping will be referred to
as clocking in or out.

Employees should clock in no sooner than five minutes before their scheduled shift and
clock out no later than five minutes after their scheduled shift. Additionally, employees
are required to clock in and out for their designated lunch periods. The length of the lunch
period will be designated by the employee’s manager; alteration or waiver of the lunch
period requires manager approval. Lunch periods are unpaid time when employees are
relieved of all duties. Waiver of the lunch period requires prior approval of the employee’s
manager. Under no circumstance may the waiver of the lunch period result in overtime
work.

Accurate timekeeping is a federal and state wage and hour requirement, and employees
are required to comply. Failing to enter time into the timekeeping system in an accurate
and timely manner is unacceptable job performance. Employees may not ask another
employee to clock in or out for them. Should an employee miss an entry into the
timekeeping system, they must notify their manager as soon as possible for correction.

Non-exempt employees are not permitted to work unscheduled time without prior
authorization from their manager. This includes clocking in early, clocking out late, or
working through scheduled break or lunch periods.

**R** **EPORTING** **T** **IME** **P** **AY** **(** **NON** --- **EXEMPT EMPLOYEES** **)**
Non-exempt employees who are required to report to work and are subsequently sent
home by the Company without completing their assigned shift due to a lack of work will
be paid any applicable reporting time pay.

Employees will be paid for no less than one hour. All time worked prior to dismissal counts
toward these totals. Reporting time pay will be compensated at the employee’s regular
rate of pay.

---

**O** **VERTIME** **(** **NON** --- **EXEMPT EMPLOYEES** **)**
The Company complies with all applicable federal and state laws with regard to payment
of overtime work. Non-exempt employees are paid overtime at the rate of one and one-
half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

Employees are required to work overtime when assigned. Any overtime worked must be
authorized by a supervisor or manager, in advance. Working unauthorized overtime or
the refusal or unavailability to work overtime is not acceptable work performance, and is
subject to discipline, including but not limited to termination.

**P** **AYROLL** **D** **EDUCTIONS** **(** **EXEMPT EMPLOYEES** **)**
The Company complies with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) and does not make improper deductions from the salaries of exempt employees.
There are, however, certain circumstances where deductions from the salaries of exempt
employees are permissible. Such circumstances include:

- When an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days forpersonal reasons other than sickness or disability

- When an exempt employee is absent for one or more full days due to sickness ordisability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide sick leave plan that
provides compensation for salary lost due to illness

- To offset amounts received as witness or jury fees, or for military pay
- For disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith forserious workplace policy violations

- For penalties imposed in good faith for serious safety infractions
- When an employee is on unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act
- During an employee's first and last week of employment, if they work less than a fullweek

If an employee believes that an improper deduction has been made, they should
immediately report this to their manager or the person responsible for payroll processing.
Reports will be promptly investigated and if it is determined that an improper deduction
has occurred, the employee will be promptly reimbursed.

**P** **AY** **A** **DJUSTMENTS** **,** **P** **ROMOTIONS AND** **D** **EMOTIONS**
All pay increases are based upon merit, market factors, and the profitability of the
Company. There may not be an automatic annual cost of living or salary adjustment.
Employee pay also may be adjusted downward. Salary decreases may take place when
there is job restructuring, job duty changes, job transfers, or adverse business economic
conditions. Demotion is a reduction in responsibility, usually accompanied by a reduction
in salary. If demotion occurs, employees will maintain their seniority with the Company.

---

**P** **ERFORMANCE** **E** **VALUATION**
Employees may receive an appraisal of their job performance as scheduled. This
evaluation may be either written or oral.

If the employee receives an evaluation sheet or other written document, they will be
required to sign it. An employee's signature does not necessarily indicate that the
employee agrees with all the comments, but that they have been given the opportunity
to examine the evaluation and discuss it with their manager. The completed and signed
evaluation form will be placed in the employee's personnel file and the employee will
receive a copy of the performance evaluation.

In addition to performance evaluations, informal counseling sessions may be conducted
from time to time.

**W** **ORK** **A** **SSIGNMENTS**
On occasion employees may be required to perform duties that are not part of their job
description or usual tasks. This may happen because a co-worker is absent, a position is
temporarily vacant, the business or department is particularly busy, or for other reasons.
Employees are expected to perform these additional duties in a timely fashion and to the
best of their ability. Should questions about process or procedure arise, employees should
speak with their manager. Unless informed otherwise, employees will be paid at their
regular rate of pay.

**E** **XPENSE** **R** **EIMBURSEMENT**
The Company will cover all reasonable, business-related expenses. Any cost that does not
fall within the guidelines below must be approved by the appropriate manager *before* the
expense is incurred. Employees may not be reimbursed for expenses that were not
approved in advance and are deemed unnecessary or extravagant.

The following types of expenses may be reimbursable under this policy:

- Lodging
- Travel expenses including airfare, reasonable airline luggage fees, train fare, bus,taxi, and related tips

- Meals, including tips up to 20%
- Laundry and dry-cleaning expenses during trips in excess of five days
- Car rental, parking fees, and tolls
- Mileage on a personal vehicle at the current IRS reimbursement rate
- Conference and convention fees
- Business entertainment expenses, up to pre-approved limits
The following expenses are examples of expenses not reimbursable under this policy:

- Airline club dues

---

- Traffic fines
- Tips in excess of 20%
- In-flight movies, mini-bar expenses, and other forms of personal entertainment
- First-class airfare
No policy can anticipate every situation that might give rise to legitimate business
expenses. Reasonable and necessary expenses not listed above may be reimbursable.
When prior approval is required, managers should use their best judgment to determine
if an unlisted expense is reimbursable under this policy.

Credit Cards
Company-issued credit cards are to be used for purchases on behalf of the Company and
for any travel expenses incurred while traveling on company business only. At no time
may an employee use a Company credit card for purchases intended for personal use;
such expenses will require that the Company be reimbursed and may lead to revocation
of credit card privileges and other discipline. Credit card expenses require the same
reimbursement documentation as other expenses.

Documentation
Requests for reimbursement of business expenses must be submitted on the Expense
Report Template. In order to comply with IRS regulations, all business expenses be
supported with adequate records; employees are responsible for keeping these records
as expenses are incurred. These records must include:

- The amount of the expenditure
- The time and place of the expenditure
- The business purpose of the expenditure
- The names and the business relationships of individuals for whom the expenditureswere made

Requests for reimbursement lacking this information will not be processed and will be
returned to the employee. While original receipts are preferred for all expenses, they are
required for those greater than $25.00. Requests for exceptions to this policy
should explain why the exception is necessary and be approved by management.

Approvals
Expense reimbursement forms, together with required documentation, must be
submitted to the employee's manager for review and approval. Once the expense
reimbursement has been approved, it should be submitted for processing no more than
30 days after the expenses occurred. Managers approving expense reports are
responsible for ensuring that the expense report have been filled out correctly with the
required documentation and that the expenses submitted are allowable under this policy.

**S** **ICK** **L** **EAVE**
The Company recognizes that the inability to work because of illness, injury or safety
needs may cause economic hardship. For this reason, O’Neill Logistics provides 40 hours
of paid sick time upon hire and annually at the beginning of each calendar year to all
employees who work in New Jersey. Employees are eligible to use sick leave on their 60 ^th^
day of employment.

Up to 40 hours of unused leave will roll over into a new benefit year.

Sick leave may be used for the following reasons:

- Diagnosis, care, treatment of, or recovery from an employee’s mental or physicalillness, injury, or health condition, or for preventive health care;

- Diagnosis, care, treatment of, or recovery from a family member’s mental or physicalillness, injury, or health condition, or for preventive health care;

- When the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care is closedbecause the governor declared a state of emergency;

- When the presence in the community of either the employee or one of their familymembers whom they need to care for would jeopardize the health of others under
either a declaration of a state of emergency by the governor or an issuance by a
health care provider, the Commissioner of Health, or another public health
authority;

---

- When the employee isolates or quarantines or cares for a family member inquarantine as a result of a suspected exposure to a communicable disease and a
finding that the presence of the employee or their family member in the community

by the governor or the recommendation, direction, or order of a healthcare provider
or authorized public official;

- When time off is needed because the employee or a member of their family is avictim of domestic or sexual violence; or

- To attend a school-related conference or meeting.
When sick leave is used, it will be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay. Sick leave
may be used in increments of two hours or more.

If the need for sick leave is foreseeable, employees must provide seven days’ notice. If
the need for sick leave is unforeseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as
practicable. Employees who use leave for three or more consecutive workdays may be
asked to provide documentation of the need for leave, such as a doctor’s note.

Unused sick leave will not be paid out at the end of employment. Employees rehired
within six months of separation will have their previously accrued but unused sick leave
restored.

**V** **ACATION**
Vacations provide a break beneficial to both the Company and the employee. Therefore,
employees are encouraged to take vacations annually. All full-time employees regularly
working 30+ hours/week are eligible to participate in the Company’s vacation benefit.
Employees are eligible to use vacation on their 60 ^th^ day of employment.

**S** **TATE** **D** **ISABILITY** **I** **NSURANCE**
Employees who are disabled because of an off-the-job injury or illness may be eligible for
temporary disability insurance through the state. Employees must have worked 20 or
more calendar weeks and earned over a certain threshold of income to qualify.

The Temporary Disability Insurance benefits program provides covered individuals Family
Leave Insurance benefits, a monetary benefit, up to 26 weeks. The Temporary Disability
Insurance benefits program does not establish the right of a covered individual to be
restored to employment following a period of disability leave. However, a covered
individual’s job may be protected under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
or the New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) which applies to employers with 50 or more
employees, if applicable.

The program requires contributions from both the Company and the employee in the
form of payroll deductions as determined by the Department of Labor and Workforce

---

Development. The maximum employee contribution is subject to change on a yearly
basis.

The Division of Temporary Disability Insurance will determine eligibility for this benefit
and claims should be filed directly with that department. Employees should notify the
Company before returning to work and provide a physician’s statement of their ability to
resume normal duties.

**F** **AMILY** **L** **EAVE** **I** **NSURANCE**
New Jersey Family Leave Insurance offers qualifying employees cash benefits for up to six
weeks to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child, or to care for a seriously ill family
member, including spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, parent or child. The
program requires no contributions from employers and is 100% funded by an employee
payroll deduction.

The Family Leave Insurance benefits program provides covered individuals Family Leave
Insurance benefits, not a leave entitlement. The Family Leave Insurance benefits program
does not establish the right of a covered individual to be restored to employment
following a period of leave from work to participate in providing care for a family member
who has a serious health condition or to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child.
However, a covered individual’s job may be protected under the federal Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or the New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA), if applicable.

The Company requires 30 days’ notice before bonding leave starts, per New Jersey Law.
If the proper notice is not provided, benefits may be reduced by 14 days. Leave to care
for a seriously ill family member should be requested as far in advance as possible under
the circumstances. Intermittent leave may be taken in increments of seven days or more
upon approval by the Company. Intermittent leave requests must be 15 days in advance
of the need for leave.

The Division of Temporary Disability Insurance will determine eligibility for this benefit
and claims should be filed directly with that department.

**N** **EW** **J** **ERSEY** **F** **AMILY** **L** **EAVE** **A** **CT**
Employees who have worked for the Company for at least one year and have worked
1,000 hours or more (not including overtime) in the previous 12 months are eligible to
take up to 12 weeks of family leave in a 24-month period. The 24-month period begins on
the first day of the employee’s first leave.

The NJFLA provides leave for the following reasons:

- The birth of a child,
- The placement of a child for adoption or foster care,
- The serious health condition of a family member, or

---

- During a public health emergency if any of the following applies:
– The employee needs to care for their child because their school or place of
care is closed by order of a public official;
– The employee needs to care for a family member who is subject to a
requirement by a public health authority (e.g., mandatory quarantine)
because they are determined to either have the communicable disease or
had a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease; or
– The employee needs to care for a family member who has been
recommended to self-quarantine by a healthcare provider or public health
authority because of a suspected exposure to the communicable disease.

**T** **EMPORARY** **D** **ISABILITY** **L** **EAVE**
The Company recognizes that a temporary disability may prevent employees from coming
to work for a period of time. In such cases, the Company may grant a temporary disability
leave. This leave does not have a minimum or maximum time frame. Rather, the Company
will attempt to reasonably accommodate the needs of the employee as well as the needs
of the Company. If a leave is granted, any extensions will be subject to the same
considerations.

Employees requesting a temporary disability leave must document their request in
writing. That request should be accompanied by a doctor's statement identifying how the
temporary disability limits the employee's ability to work, the date and the estimated
date of return and, where appropriate, diagnosis and prognosis. Should the employee’s
expected return date change, the employee should notify the Company as soon as
possible. Prior to returning to employment with the Company, employees will be required
to submit written medical certification of their ability to work, including any restrictions.
Upon returning to work, if employees qualify, they will be reinstated to their former
position or one that is substantially the same, depending upon the availability of any
position at that time.

The leave will be unpaid, except that employees must use any available paid sick leave
concurrently and may choose to use other accrued paid time off concurrently once their
sick leave has been exhausted.

**M** **ILITARY** **L** **EAVE**
If employees are on an extended military leave of absence, they are entitled to be
restored to their previously held position or similar position, if available, without loss of
any rights, privileges or benefits provided the employee meets the requirements specified
in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).

An employee who is a member of the reserve corps of the armed forces of the United
States or of the National Guard or the Naval Militia will be granted temporary leave of
absence without pay while engaged in military duty as required by state employment

law. In certain circumstances, a letter from the employee’s commanding officer may be
requested to establish the dates of duty.

**V** **OLUNTEER** **E** **MERGENCY** **R** **ESPONDER** **L** **EAVE**
An employee who is an active member in good standing of a volunteer fire company, a
volunteer member of a duly incorporated first aid, rescue or ambulance squad, or a
member of any county or municipal volunteer Office of Emergency Management will be
granted unpaid time off when they fail to report for work because they are serving as a
volunteer emergency responder during a state of emergency.

The volunteer emergency responder must provide the Company with notice at least one
hour before they are scheduled to report to work, and upon returning work,
documentation from the officer in charge affirming that the volunteer emergency
responder was rendering emergency services and listing the date and time the volunteer
emergency responder was relieved from emergency duty.

Employees will be allowed time off to attend jury duty. The Company may request that
the employee ask to be excused from service, or request postponement, if their absence

Employees must submit a copy of the original summons to their manager as soon as it is
received. For periods of service longer than two days, the Company may require proof
that the employee attended jury service. Employees should report for work on any day,
or partial day, not actually spent attending jury duty.

Employees may keep any fees received for jury duty. Jury duty leave is unpaid, though
employees will be allowed to use accrued paid time off, if any is available. Exempt

Leave Entitlements
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an eligible employee can take up to weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period. To be eligible, an employee
must meet the following three criteria:

- Have worked for the Company for at least 12 months;
- Have at least 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months before taking leave; and
- Work at a location where the Company has at least 50 employees within 75 miles ofthe employee’s worksite.

Eligible employees can take leave for the following reasons:

- The birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care;
- To bond with a child (leave must be taken within one year of the child’s birth orplacement);

- To care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a qualifying serioushealth condition;

- For the employee’s own qualifying serious health condition that makes the employeeunable to perform their job;

- For qualifying exigencies related to the foreign deployment of a military memberwho is the employee’s spouse, child, or parent.

An eligible employee who is a covered servicemember’s spouse, child, parent, or next of
kin may also take up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for
the servicemember with a serious injury or illness.

Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to the same job or one
nearly identical to it with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and
conditions.

Using Leave
An employee does not need to use leave in one block. When it is medically necessary or
the Company otherwise approves, employees may take leave intermittently or on a

---

reduced schedule. Employees on FMLA leave may be required to report periodically to
the Company regarding their status and intent to return to work. An employee who fails
to return to work at the expiration of the leave without an approved extension will be
considered to have resigned.

Employees must inform the Company if the need for leave is for a reason for which FMLA
leave was previously taken or certified.

Employees may choose, or the Company may require, use of accrued paid leave while
taking FMLA leave. If an employee substitutes accrued paid leave for FMLA leave, they
must comply with the Company’s normal paid leave policies.

Employees must give 30 days’ advance notice of the need for FMLA leave. If it is not
possible to give 30 days’ notice, an employee must notify their manager as soon as
possible.

Documentation
The Company may require a certification from a health care provider, and periodic
recertification, supporting the need for leave. If certification is requested, employees will
have 15 days to provide it. If we determine that the certification is incomplete, we will
provide a written notice indicating what additional information is required.

Employees do not have to share a medical diagnosis but must provide enough information
so that the Company can determine if the leave qualifies for FMLA protection. Sufficient
information could include a doctor’s note informing the Company that the employee is or
will be unable to perform their job functions, that a family member cannot perform daily
activities, or that hospitalization or continuing medical treatment is necessary.

If we become aware that an employee’s need for leave is for a reason that may qualify
under the FMLA, we will notify the employee if they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if
eligible, provide a notice of rights and responsibilities under the FMLA. If the employee is
not eligible, we will provide a reason for ineligibility. The Company will notify employees
if leave will be designated as FMLA leave, and if so, how much leave will be designated as
FMLA leave.

Benefits
While employees are on FMLA leave, health insurance coverage will continue as if the
employees were not on leave. Employees are responsible for their portion of the medical
insurance premium cost, if any. Failure to pay the employee portion of the health
insurance premiums in advance (or on the schedule established by the payroll
department) may result in the termination of coverage. If eligible, the employee will
receive notification of continuation of benefits.

---

The Company reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the employee for the
medical insurance premiums paid by the Company while the employee was on FMLA
leave if the employee fails to return from FMLA. The Company will not seek
reimbursement if the failure to return is due to continuation, recurrence, or onset of a
serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s family member that would
otherwise qualify for FMLA leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.

The Company will not interfere with an employee’s FMLA rights or retaliate against them
for using or trying to use FMLA leave, opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA,
or being involved in any proceeding under or related to the FMLA.

Employees who believe they have not received the benefits to which they are entitled
under FMLA are strongly encouraged to speak to another member of management or
Human Resources for clarification or resolution. Failing that, an employee is able to file a
complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, or may bring a
private action. FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or
supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement that provides greater
family or medical leave rights.

**P** **ERSONAL** **L** **EAVE OF** **A** **BSENCE**
Regular full-time employees who have been with the Company for more than six months
may request a personal leave of absence without pay. The employee must submit their
request in writing and state the date they would like the leave to begin, the date they
expect to return, and the reason for the leave. The Company will consider all factors,
including the necessity of the leave and the impact on business operations, and provide
written approval or denial of the request at its sole discretion.

If approved, employees must use their leave of absence for the approved purpose. Sick
leave, vacation time, seniority and other benefits will not accrue during an unpaid leave
of absence. Holidays that occur during the leave of absence will not be paid. If an
employee fails to return to work on the scheduled date of return, the Company will
assume the employee has resigned.

**B** **EREAVEMENT** **L** **EAVE**
A regular employee of the Company may request a leave of absence with pay for a
maximum of 3 working day(s) upon the death of a member of their immediate family.
Members of the immediate family are defined as parents, spouse, domestic partner,
child, sibling, grandchild, parent-in-law, and corresponding step-relatives. Proof of the
need for leave may be required.

**HEALTH, SAFETY, AND SECURITY**

**N** **ON** **-S** **MOKING**
Smoking, vaping, and use of chew are not permitted in any Company buildings, work sites,
or vehicles. Employees wishing to engage in these activities may do so during their
designated break times, outside of Company buildings, in designated areas (or off the
property if no area is designated), and in accordance with local ordinances.

**D** **RUG AND** **A** **LCOHOL**
The Company is dedicated to providing employees with a workplace that is free of drugs
and alcohol. While on Company premises, whether during work time or non-work time,
employees are prohibited from being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. There are
limited exceptions for the use of prescription drugs (not including marijuana), as long as
they do not create safety issues or impair an employee's ability to do their job, and the
moderate use of alcohol at company-sponsored or sanctioned events.

Employees are strictly prohibited from possessing illegal drugs, cannabis, or excessive
quantities of prescription or over-the-counter drugs while on Company premises,
performing Company-related duties, or operating any Company equipment. Any drugs
confiscated that are suspected of being illegal will be turned over to the appropriate law
enforcement agency.

Employees taking medication should consult a medical professional to determine
whether the drug may affect their personal safety or ability to perform their job and
should advise their manager of any resulting job limitations. Once notified, the Company
will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the limitation.

The Company reserves the right to test any employee for the use of illegal drugs,
marijuana, or alcohol, in accordance with applicable law. Employees in safety-sensitive
positions may be subject to regular or random drug testing. Drug or alcohol tests may also
be conducted after an accident in which drugs or alcohol could reasonably be involved,
or when behavior or impairment on the job creates reasonable suspicion of use. Under
those circumstances, the employee may be driven to a certified lab for testing at the
Company’s expense. Refusal to be tested for drugs or alcohol will be treated the same as
a positive test result.

Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination.

To the extent that any federal, state, or local law or regulation limits or prohibits the
application of any provision of this policy, then that particular provision will be ineffective
in that jurisdiction only, while the remainder of the policy remains in effect.

**R** **EASONABLE** **A** **CCOMMODATIONS**
If the Company is made aware of an employee's disability and resulting need for
accommodation, Human Resources or the employee's manager will engage with them in
the interactive process. This process will determine what, if any, accommodations are
necessary and reasonable in order to assist the employee in doing the essential functions
of their job. Whether an accommodation is reasonable will be determined based on a
number of factors, including whether it will effectively assist the employee in doing the
essential functions of their job, the cost, and the effect on business operations. In most
cases, employees will be required to provide documentation from an appropriate
healthcare provider. Human Resources will provide employees with the necessary form.

All employees are required to comply with safety standards. Employees who pose a direct
threat to the health or safety of themselves or others in the workplace may be temporarily
moved into another position or placed on leave until it is determined if a reasonable
accommodation will effectively mitigate the risk.

**I** **NJURY AND** **A** **CCIDENT** **R** **ESPONSE AND** **R** **EPORTING**
If an employee is injured or witnesses an injury at work, they must report it immediately
to the nearest available manager. Employees should render any assistance requested by
that manager. When any accident, injury, or illness occurs while an employee is at work,
regardless of the nature or severity, the employee must complete an injury reporting form
and return it to Human Resources as soon as possible. Reporting should not be allowed
to delay necessary medical attention. Once the accident is reported, follow-up will be
handled by Human Resources or the designated Safety Officer, including a determination
as to whether the injured employee may return to work.

Questions asked by law enforcement or fire officials making an investigative report should
be answered giving only factual information and avoiding speculation. Liability for
personal injury or property damage should never be admitted in answering an
investigatory question asked by law enforcement or fire officials.

In addition to compliance with safety measures imposed by federal Occupational Safety
and Health Act (OSHA) and state law, the Company has an independent interest in making
its facilities a safe and healthy place to work. The Company recognizes that employees
may be in a position to notice dangerous conditions and practices and therefore
encourages employees to report such conditions, as well as non-functioning or hazardous
equipment, to a manager immediately. Appropriate remedial measures will be taken
when possible and appropriate. Employees will not be retaliated or discriminated against
for reporting of accidents, injuries, or illnesses, filing of safety-related complaints, or
requesting to see injury and illness logs.

**W** **ORKERS** **'** **C** **OMPENSATION**
The Company carries insurance that covers work-related injuries and illnesses. The
workers' compensation insurance carrier governs the benefits provided. These benefits

will not be limited, expanded, or modified by any statements of Company personnel or
Company documents. In the case of any discrepancy, the insurance carrier's documents
will control.

**W** **ORKPLACE** **V** **IOLENCE AND** **S** **ECURITY**
The Company expects all employees to conduct themselves in a non-threatening, non-
abusive manner at all times. No direct, conditional, or veiled threat of harm to any
employee, customer, business partner, or Company property will be acceptable. Acts of
violence or intimidation of others will not be tolerated. Any employee who commits, or
threatens to commit, a violent act against any person while on Company premises, will
be subject to discipline, up to immediate termination.

Employees share the responsibility of identifying and alleviating threatening or violent
behaviors. Any employee who is subjected to or threatened with violence, or who is
aware of another individual who has been subjected to or threatened with violence,
should immediately report this information to a manager. Threats will be investigated and
appropriate remedial or disciplinary action will be taken.

**D** **RIVING** **S** **AFETY**
Employees who drive on Company business are expected to drive safely and responsibly
and to use common sense and courtesy. Employees are also subject to the following rules
and conditions:

1. A valid driver's license must be maintained as a condition of continued employmentfor positions that require driving. The company may request to see an employee's
license at any time.

**I** **NCLEMENT** **W** **EATHER AND** **O** **UTAGES**
This policy establishes guidelines for Company operations during periods of extreme
weather and similar emergencies. The Company will remain open in all but the most
extreme circumstances. Unless an emergency closing is announced, all employees are
expected to report to work. However, the Company does not advise employees to take
unwarranted risks when traveling to work in the event of inclement weather or other
emergencies. Each employee should exercise their best judgment with regard to road
conditions and other safety concerns.

Emergency/Weather update (Option #1) – Employees should call 732-375-9216 for
emergency and weather-related updates for Monroe NJ at least 1 hour prior to your shift
start time. A recorded message will be posted to give you instructions and building status
for the day. We will let you know if the building will be open for the day. We will also let
you know if we will have a delayed opening or building closure for the day.

Employee Call Outs (Option #2) – Employees who will not be reporting to work for their
scheduled shift should call 732-375-9216 at least 1 hour prior to your shift start time. The
employee should state their name, what shift they are working on and the reason for the
call out. They should also provide a contact number where they can be reached at in the
event that we need to call them back for additional information.

Designation of Emergency Closing
Only by the authorization of designated managers will the Company cease operations due
to emergency circumstances. If severe weather conditions develop during working hours,
it is at the discretion of Management to release employees. Employees will generally be
expected to remain at work until the appointed closing time.

---

Procedures during Closings
If weather or traveling conditions delay or prevent an employee’s reporting to work, their
immediate supervisor should be notified as soon as possible. If possible, such notification
should be made by a telephone conversation directly with the supervisor. If direct contact
is not possible, leaving a detailed voicemail message or message with another employee
is acceptable.

An employee who is unable to report to work may use any available vacation or personal
time or take the day off without pay.

Pay and Leave Practices
When a partial or full-day closing is authorized by Management, the following pay and
paid leave practices apply:

- Non-exempt hourly employees will be sent home for partial days with the option ofusing vacation or personal time for the remainder of the day. If paid time off is not
available, employees will be excused from work without pay and without disciplinary
action.

- Exempt employees will be expected to continue work from home if their job dutiesallow. The Company will pay the exempt employee’s regular salary regardless, as
outlined in the Payroll Deductions policy.

- Exempt and non-exempt employees already scheduled to be off during emergencyclosings are charged such leave as was scheduled.

Other Work Options
Supervisors may approve requests for employees to temporarily work from home, if doing
so allows completion of work assignments.

**WORKPLACE GUIDELINES**

**H** **OURS OF** **W** **ORK**
Employees are expected to be at their work area and ready to work at their scheduled
time. Employees will be given their work hours upon hire and at the time of any change
in position. If the normal work hours are changed or if the Company changes its operating
hours, employees will be given notice.

**O** **FF** --- **THE** **-C** **LOCK** **W** **ORK**
Non-exempt employees must accurately record all time worked, regardless of when and
where the work is performed. Off-the-clock work (doing work that is not reported in the
timekeeping system) is prohibited. No member of management may request, require, or
authorize non-exempt employees to perform work without compensation. Any possible
violations should be reported promptly to a member of management.

**M** **EAL** **P** **ERIODS**
Employees under age 18 who are scheduled to work five or more consecutive hours in
one workday are entitled to take a non-compensated meal period each workday of minutes.

Employees over the age of 18 are entitled to 30-minute meal break, unpaid. A 15-minute
rest break will also be provided.

**L** **ACTATION** **A** **CCOMMODATION**
The Company provides a supportive environment to enable breastfeeding employees to
express milk during work hours. Accommodations under this policy include unpaid break
time and a private place (other than a bathroom) that is close to the employee's work
area to express milk.

When possible, time provided under this policy should be taken concurrently with other
breaks to which the employee is entitled. Employees will be paid for the duration of their
regular rest breaks, if applicable, and additional time will be unpaid. Exempt employee
pay will not be affected by lactation break time.

Any form of discrimination or harassment related to breastfeeding is unacceptable and
will not be tolerated.

**A** **TTENDANCE AND** **T** **ARDINESS**
Employees are expected to be at work and ready to go when their scheduled shift begins
or resumes. If an employee is unable to be at work on time, or at all, please call 732-375-
9216 no later than 1 hour before the start of their scheduled shift. Employees must leave
a voicemail with their name, department and reason for the absence. Employees are also
required to provide a contact number where they can be reached in the event
management needs to call the employee for additional information. If an employee’s

---

manager is not available, the employee should contact another member of management.
If an employee is physically unable to contact the Company, they should ask another
person to make contact on their behalf. Leaving a message with a co-worker or answering
service is not considered proper notification. Excessive tardiness or absences are
unacceptable job performance.

When an employee calls in absent, they should provide their expected time or date of
return. The Company reserves the right to require proof of the need for absence, if
allowed by law. If an employee is absent for three consecutive days and has not provided
proper notification, the Company will assume that the employee has voluntarily quit their
position and will proceed with the termination process.

If an employee becomes ill during their scheduled work day and feels they may need to
leave before the end of their shift, they should notify their manager immediately. If an
employee is unable to perform their job at an acceptable level, they may be sent home
until they are well enough to work.

Absences should be arranged as far in advance as possible. When an employee needs to
be absent during the workday they should attempt to schedule their outside appointment
or obligation so that their absence has the smallest impact possible on business
operations.

**P** **ERSONAL** **A** **PPEARANCE AND** **H** **YGIENE**
Employees are expected to present a professional image, both through behavior and
appearance. Accordingly, employees must wear work-appropriate attire during the
workday or any time they are representing the company. Clothing does not need to be
expensive, but should be clean and neat in appearance. Employees should consider their
level of customer and public contact and the types of meetings they are scheduled to
attend in determining what attire is appropriate.

The following are generally not acceptable:

- Bare feet or flip flops
- Spandex, sweats, or work out attire
- Sagging pants, shorts, or skirts
- Sexually provocative clothing or exposed undergarments
- Clothing with offensive slogans or pictures
- Clothing showing excessive wear and tear
- Any clothing or accessories that would present a safety hazard
- Visible tattoos that are not appropriate in content
All employees are expected to maintain appropriate oral and bodily hygiene. Hair
(including facial hair) should be clean and neat. Accessories should not interfere with an

---

employee's work. The excessive use of perfume or cologne is unacceptable, as are odors
that are disruptive or offensive to others or may exacerbate allergies.

Managers are responsible for enforcing dress and grooming standards for their
department. Any employee whose appearance does not meet these standards may be
counseled. If their appearance is unduly distracting or the clothing is unsafe, the
employee may be sent home to change into something more appropriate.

Reasonable accommodation will be made for employees' sincerely held religious beliefs
and disabilities when such accommodations do not cause an undue burden. Employees
who would like to request an accommodation or have other questions about this policy
should contact their supervisor.

**C** **ONFIDENTIALITY**
Employees may not disclose any confidential information or trade secrets to anyone
outside the Company without the appropriate authorization. Confidential information
may include internal reports, financials, client lists, methods of production, or other
internal business-related communications. Trade secrets may include information
regarding the development of systems, processes, products, design, instrument, formulas
and technology. Confidential information may only be disclosed or discussed with those
who need the information. Conversation of a confidential nature should not be held
within earshot of the public or clients.

When any inquiry is made regarding an employee, former employee, client, or customer,
the inquiry should be forwarded to a manager or Human Resources without comment
from the employee.

This policy is intended to alert employees to the need for discretion at all times and is not
intended to inhibit normal business communications. In addition, nothing in this policy is
intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations
Act.

**S** **OLICITATION AND** **D** **ISTRIBUTION**
Solicitation during work time and in work areas is prohibited. Solicitation is defined as the
act of asking for something, selling something, urging someone to do something,
petitioning, or distributing persuasive materials. This could include, but is not limited to,
asking for donations for a child's school (including through sales of a product), attempting
to convert someone to or from a religion, distributing political materials, or collecting
signatures. Work time includes time when either the person soliciting, or being solicited
to, is scheduled to be performing their work duties. Work areas include areas where
employees generally do work, such as cubicles, offices, or conference rooms, and does
not include areas such as the lunch or break room.

---

This policy does not prevent employees from using their approved breaks and rest periods
to solicit outside of working areas and is not intended to infringe an employee's Section
7 rights. Those not employed by the company are prohibited from solicitation on
company property at all times.

**C** **ONFLICT OF** **I** **NTEREST**
A conflict of interest arises when an employee is engaged in activity that could be
detrimental to the company. This includes when an employee improperly uses their
position with the company for personal gain or the gain of someone with whom they have
a relationship. *Improper use* includes behavior that is illegal, as well as behavior that is
unethical or questionable to a reasonable person. These are some examples of a conflict
of interest:

- An employee requesting or requiring gifts or discounts in exchange for starting orcontinuing a business relationship with a client or vendor

- An employee selecting a relative's company as a supplier when they have notproduced the best proposal

- An employee taking a second job working for a competitor and sharing confidentialcompany information with the competitor

- An employee taking a second job that interferes with their ability to do their workfor the Company at their full potential, whether due to scheduling, exhaustion, or
some other factor

Because how things appear, whether accurate or not, has a significant impact on the
Company's reputation, employees should also avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest. If questions arise as to whether a certain activity or behavior is a conflict of
interest, employees should speak with their manager or HR.

**B** **USINESS** **G** **IFTS**
Employees are prohibited from directly or indirectly requesting or accepting a gift for
themselves or the company that has a value of $50 or more. If an employee is offered or
given anything of value from any client, prospective client, vendor, or business partner in
connection with company business, they should alert their manager immediately.

**O** **UTSIDE** **A** **CTIVITIES**
Employees may engage in outside employment during non-working hours, provided
doing so does not interfere with their job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.
Prior to accepting outside employment, employees should notify their manager in writing.
The notice must include the name of the Company, the title and nature of the position,
the number of working hours per week, and the time of scheduled work hours. If the
position constitutes a conflict of interest or interferes with the employee’s job at any
time, they may be required to limit or end their outside employment.

Conduct that negatively affects an employee’s job performance, the job performance of
fellow employees, or the Company’s legitimate business interests—including its
reputation and ability to make a profit—may result in disciplinary action up to and
including termination.

or anyone associated with it, including fellow employees and clients. Writing something
that is untrue and ultimately harmful to any person or organization is defamation and can
lead to significant financial liability for the person who makes the statement.

information. Trade secrets include, but are not limited to, information regarding the
development of systems, products, and technology. Private and confidential information

permission to share.

Employees must not represent themselves as a spokesperson for the Company unless
requested to do so by management. If the Company is a subject of the content being

about the fact that they are employed with the Company but that their views do not
necessarily represent those of the Company.

Accounts
Employees must not use Company email addresses to register for social media accounts
unless doing so at the request of management. Employees who manage social media
accounts on behalf of the Company should ensure that at least one member of
management has all the login information needed to access the account in their absence.

or the productivity of their coworkers. Reasonableness will be determined by
management.

The Company is not liable for lost, misplaced, or stolen property. Employees should take
all precautions necessary to safeguard their personal possessions. Employees should not
have their personal mail sent to the Company, as it may be automatically opened, and
should check with their manager before having larger items delivered to the workplace.

**P** **ARKING**
All parking is at an employee’s own risk. Employees and visitors should lock their vehicles
and take appropriate safeguards to protect their valuables, including removing them from
the vehicle if appropriate under the circumstances. Employees are not to park in areas
reserved for visitors.
