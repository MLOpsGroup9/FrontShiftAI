###### I.YOUR HANDBOOK

**An Introduction**
This handbook is provided to each employee as a guide to the Company’s policies and procedures. It is
not intended to create, and should not be construed as creating, a contract between the Company and
any one or all of its employees. All employees are employed on an at-will basis. At-will employment
means that either the Company or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any
time, with or without prior notice, for any reason not otherwise prohibited by law. Any representation
to the contrary is not binding on the Company unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized
representative of the Company.

Please read this handbook carefully. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and
outlines the programs developed by the Company for your benefit. One of our primary objectives for
our employees is to create an environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.
We believe you will find an abundance of resources in this handbook that will help you achieve your
personal and professional goals.

Our employee handbook cannot possibly anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise, and
it should not be considered as the only or final source of information. It does replace all prior handbooks
and related publications previously distributed. As questions arise, we ask that you consult with your
manager or a human resources representative for further information about a policy, guideline, or any
other information regarding your employment that may or may not be contained in this publication.
As we continue to grow, and as our business environment continues to change, there may be a need to
change the policies, guidelines, and benefits described in this handbook. As such, we reserve the right to
revise, amend, modify, add to, rescind or terminate these policies, guidelines, and benefits at any time
and in any manner that we deem appropriate to serve the needs and interests of the Company and its
employees.

###### II. ABOUT LUND FOOD HOLDINGS, INC.
Every Company has its own unique culture, which shapes for each of its employees how it feels to be
part of that Company’s working family. At Lund Food Holdings, Inc., our culture is a composite of our
vision for the Company, our mission statement, and our shared values. A brief introduction of these
business philosophies follows and includes insights about their importance in the LFHI workplace and
how they are incorporated into our everyday business environments.

**OUR VISION**
Our vision for the Company identifies what it is we are striving to achieve and what we ultimately want
the Company to be. As valued members of our Company’s workforce, each of us has the opportunity
and a responsibility to direct our personal work activities in support of this vision.

**To be the predominant upscale provider of food and services**

**in every market of choice.**

**OUR MISSION**
Our Mission Statement was created by a team of employees shortly after Lunds and Byerlys united. They
set out to answer the question “what is it that we do?” You will notice the icon that’s used to convey our
Company’s mission looks like a person and an exclamation point is incorporated into the design. The
icon signifies the importance of each person in our Company – employees make sensational service
happen and employees create what we call the “WOW!” factor. Everyone has a role in this. As you read
our mission statement, we ask that you think about what it is that you will do to make our mission come
alive.

**Together**
One Company, two brands (store formats), and the connection of all entities: stores, production facilities
and corporate support office.

**We**
Team, community, caring, and responsibility.

**Create**
Innovation, synergy, opportunity, delivery, service, empowerment, pride, higher standards, market
leadership, and new traditions.

**Sensational**
Exceed expectations, feeling of “WOW!”, extraordinary, unexpected, and fun.

**Shopping Experiences**
More than an errand, point of differentiation, world class journey, style, and one-on-one connections.

**For a Lifetime**
Relationship, retention, ownership, responsibility, bringing them back, families and generations –
customers and employees, better each time, every time, all the time.

**OUR MISSION**
Together we create sensational shopping experiences for a lifetime.

**OUR VALUES**
Our ability to consistently lead will be guided by our values. We thrive on the power and passion of our
employees by enthusiastically encouraging and preparing them to be successful. We judge ourselves by
our beliefs and intentions, while others judge us by our behaviors and actions.

The values, which guide our business practices, were identified by the Company’s owner, Tres Lund, and
its executive team members. These values represent a set of beliefs and principles that govern the
manner in which we work together and the ways in which we conduct our business.

Respect, honesty and integrity, empowerment, innovation, safety, development and communication are
Company values that we bring to life by supporting them and practicing them.

**Teamwork** means collaboration in and with all levels is the key to our success.

*“Together Everyone Achieves More.”*

| | OUR MISSION |
|--|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| | Together we create sensational shopping experiences for a lifetime. |

---

**Respect** means honoring all the diversity in our work environment and includes coworkers, customers,
vendors, and our communities. It means consideration of others’ feelings, concerns and ideas.

*“People with humility don’t think less of themselves, they just think about themselves less.”*

*“Sometimes when the numbers look right the decision is still wrong.”*

**Innovation** means continually striving to improve our processes, our products, and our quality, and
helping our coworkers do their job better.

*“Managing only for profit is like trying to play tennis with your eye on the scoreboard and not on*
*the ball.”*

**OUR HISTORY**
Both Lunds and Byerlys have a rich history, beginning as Minnesota companies founded by local families.
Lunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove’s, a local supermarket back
in 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store
on Lake Street in Minneapolis.

Don Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden
Valley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single
Company in 1997.

The new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is
owned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr.

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued
prosperity for the 21st century and beyond.

**MEDIA PHILOSOPHY**
It is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or
other public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we
speak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a
Company-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your
location manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding
the media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office.

###### III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES

**EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER**
Our Company recognizes and values the benefits of diversity in people, ideas and cultures. Accordingly,
our Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment
free from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a
policy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender,
age, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with
regard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law.

---

This commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including
selection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,
and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all
classifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment.

If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or
process that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your
department manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources.

You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal
employment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your
complaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be
engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion.

**REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES**
Our Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting
discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any
qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such
individual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential
functions of the job.

Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a
qualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us
aware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her
position. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue
hardship for the Company.

Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file.
The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate
disclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the
confidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information
is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at
management’s discretion.

Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the
essential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This
policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions
necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws.

**IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE**
Our Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are
authorized to work in the United States. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility
Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility.
Former employees who are rehired with the Company must recertify their employment eligibility by

---

completing a new I-9 and provide the appropriate documentation to establish identity and employment
eligibility. Questions about immigration law issues may be directed to the human resource department.

**RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE**
As part of our strong stand and value set with respect to our EEO, discrimination and harassment
policies, all of us have an obligation and duty to be proactive, intervening and addressing any acts that
may be potentially offensive or inappropriate particularly from a race and/or religious basis. This
includes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or
classes of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might
be displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by
reporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It
also includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory
and reporting such to your manager to take action to correct the situation.

The key message is: Be proactive and address issues by reporting them to your manager as you see
them occur.

We all are responsible for providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and
intolerant acts, while maintaining the highest levels of respect, teamwork and innovation.

**RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**
For those employees who can provide proof of strongly held religious beliefs, the Company will
reasonably accommodate religious-based requests with respect to work schedule, breaks, position
assignment, or other work-related activities provided such requests do not impose an undue hardship
on the work and/or operational needs of the business.

You are responsible for informing your manager of the need for such religious-based accommodations in
writing.

For more information and/or concerns, please see your manager or contact a human resources
representative.

**HARASSMENT INCLUDING OFFENSIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR**
All employees have a right to expect and enjoy respectful work environments. Employees are prohibited
from harassing other employees whether or not the incidents of harassment occur on employer
premises and whether or not the incidents occur during working hours. The Company has a zero
tolerance harassment policy and any harassment or offensive or inappropriate behavior may result in
corrective action, up to and including termination of employment.

The Company prohibits all sexual and other forms of harassment. Harassment consists of unwelcome
conduct, whether verbal, written or physical, that is sexual in nature and/or based upon a person’s
protected status, such as race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status,
medical condition, veteran status, sexual orientation or other protected status under applicable law.

---

**SEXUAL HARASSMENT**
Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or visual, verbal
or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
 Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment; or
 Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the
individual; or
 Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment

Forbidden conduct: With respect to harassment, the following is a partial list of conduct that violates the
Lund Food Holdings, Inc. Non-Harassment & Retaliation policy:
 Unwelcome sexual advances
 Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors
 Threatening retaliation or retaliating after a negative response to sexual advances
 Leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying sexually suggestive or offensive objects, photographs,
cartoons, calendars or posters
 Transmitting inappropriate, sexual, or offensive images, derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings or
information through social media, a computer network, electronic mail, or any other means of
communication
 Using obscene, derogatory, or vulgar language, epithets, slurs, sexually explicit or otherwise
inappropriate jokes, or making inappropriate or derogatory comments about an employee
 Written communications of a sexual nature or containing statements which may be offensive to
individuals in a particular protected group such as racial or ethnic stereotypes or caricatures that are
distributed in hard copy, on social media, via a computer network, or any other means of
communication
 Unwelcome verbal sexual advances or propositions
 Verbal abuse of a sexual nature such as unwelcome graphic or verbal commentary about an
individual’s body, sexually degrading words to describe an individual, suggestive or obscene letters,
notes or invitations
 Unwelcome physical conduct such as touching, assault, impeding or blocking normal movements
 Retaliation against or toward an individual for making harassment reports to the company or for
participating in an investigation into harassment allegations

Retaliation or reprisal against persons making complaints or providing information will not be tolerated.
The company strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee for using this complaint procedure,
reporting harassment, or for filing, testifying, or participating in any manner in any investigation, or
hearing conducted by the company or governmental enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation
includes, but is not limited to, termination, demotion, suspension, failure to hire or consider for hire,
failure to give equal consideration in making employment decisions, failure to make employment
recommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions or otherwise denying any
employment benefit. Any employee found to have retaliated against another employee will be subject
to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Reporting an Incident: If you experience behavior that is offensive or uncomfortable, or are aware of
harassment in the workplace, please advise the person who is initiating such behavior that you find it
offensive and ask him or her to stop. If you are uncomfortable confronting the individual directly, or if

---

the behavior persists, you must advise your supervisor or your location manager and a human resources
business partner of your concerns.

All complaints will receive immediate attention, including an investigation and any corrective action
deemed necessary by the Company to ensure that the harassment and/or offensive behavior stops. All
complaints of this nature will be kept confidential with information being disclosed to only those
persons who have a legitimate need to know.

All managers must notify the human resources department of any harassment complaints that they
receive. All management, together with the human resources department, are responsible for ensuring
that appropriate and timely action is taken to investigate harassment complaints and respond with
actions that effectively resolve the situation and prevent recurrence of the behavior.

False and malicious complains of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as opposed to complaints
that, even if erroneous, are made in good faith) may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

**EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL**
All employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an
employment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment
relationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you
as the employee or the Company as your employer at any time, for any reason, with or without cause,
and with or without notice. No manager or any representative of the Company, other than an officer of
the Company, has the authority to enter into any agreement with you for employment for any specified
period, or to make any promises or commitments that are contrary to the employment-at-will policy.
Any such agreements entered into by an officer of the Company must be in writing and signed by the
officer.

**EMPLOYEE REFERRALS**
We often find that our own employees are our best source of potential employees and as such we
appreciate and encourage employee referrals. Our employee referral program provides you with the
opportunity to earn a bonus (less applicable taxes) for every employee that you refer that becomes
employed by the Company. Check with your location manager for specific information regarding the
referral program.

**EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND ROOMMATES**
Family members, significant others, and roommates are a good source of referrals and future
employees. All are welcome to apply for and accept employment with the Company. However, to
reduce the intrusion of domestic relations in our work environment, we ask that immediate family
members, significant others and roommates avoid working in the same department whenever possible,
and we prohibit family members, significant others and roommates from working in positions where
one is the direct supervisor or manager of the other. When such cases occur, the Company will attempt
accommodation through transfer, relocation, or job change. In such situations, the affected employees
will need to decide which remedy they will select. An exception is made for periods of less than twenty-
nine (29) calendar days where relatives may work together to satisfy short-term, temporary needs of
the business.

---

**ETHICSPOINT**
EthicsPoint is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool for employees to report fraud, abuse and
other misconduct in the workplace in a completely confidential and anonymous manner. You can file an
EthicsPoint report from any computer that can access the Internet at the following website:
www.lundfoodholdings.ethics-point.com . You can file online from home and many public locations,
including public libraries. If you don’t have access or are uncomfortable using a computer, call the
EthicsPoint toll-free hotline – 1-866-437¬4478. It’s available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Nothing in our policies, guidelines or handbook is meant to restrict any activity that is protected under
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

###### IV. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY

**STANDARDS OF CONDUCT**
It is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect
that all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate
integrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of
conduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the
safety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive
discipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all
possible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of
behavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship. For more information, contact your
manager or a human resources business partner.

**Rudeness to a customer**
As a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely
committed to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a
considerate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe
you are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to
treat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be
tolerated.

**Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift**
When you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are
expected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption
caused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in
advance of your shift as possible.

Failure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is
inexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action.

If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your
supervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment.
Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or
manager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of
absence or disciplinary suspension.

---

For more information, please review the attendance policy and/or speak with your manager.

**Misappropriation of money or property…theft**
Taking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is
forbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be
consumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be
visible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and
prosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible.

Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not
worked is considered theft and could cost you your job.

**Working off the clock**
We value the work that you do and it’s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you
perform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to
accurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools
accurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be
tolerated and could cost you your job.

**Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants**
You may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including
inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the
job. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee
allowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,
including inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants.

We encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or
alcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees
who violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for
assistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked
to submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of
alcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Any such test will be at the Company’s expense and by a physician and/or
testing facility selected by the Company and in full compliance with state and federal law.

If you are under a physician’s guidance and are taking prescription drugs or other medication which may

contractors, including those who have a valid permit to carry a handgun pursuant to the Conceal and

intentionally destructive acts that result in damage to Company property, or other employees’ or
customers’ possessions, equipment, or property will not be tolerated.

Dishonesty will not be tolerated, and falsification of Company records and transactions can result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

**Disclosure of confidential information**
Disclosing confidential information about a coworker, a customer or the Company is forbidden.
Discussing financial, proprietary, competitive or any other confidential information about the Company
with individuals or such information about other employees and/or customers, other than those who

know, is strictly prohibited. Note that there are positions which require certification in keeping certain
employee/customer information confidential.

**Integrity & Trust**
The Company’s goal is to achieve success by continuing to provide products and services to our
customers that exceed expectations and are of the highest value.

We expect every employee to adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity and
to avoid any situation that might reflect unfavorably on the Company. Our professional business goals

---

are important and demanding, but ethical standards must take precedence. We seek to encourage free
enterprise and comply with all laws that prohibit unfair or unethical business practices. Compliance
with the letter of the law is only our minimum standard; we have always sought to and will continue to
seek adherence to its spirits as well.

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. employees are expected to fully comply with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations wherever they do business. Employees may not use a consultant, broker or other third party
to do anything they are prohibited from doing themselves. Ignorance of the law, demands of the
business, and pressure from co-workers are not excuses for violating the law.

**Selling liquor or tobacco to under-age customers**
Our Company abides by all laws governing the sale of age restricted products such as alcohol, tobacco
and tobacco related products. Under no circumstances will the Company tolerate any employee selling
liquor to any customer who is under age 21 or tobacco and/or tobacco related products to any customer
who is under age 18. It is your responsibility to know and comply with the law—we cannot over
emphasize the importance of this—you can be subject to costly fines, legal fees and lose your job for
failure to comply with these regulations. Note that our registers are programmed for ages and age
calendars are at each service counter.

**Non-solicitation**
Solicitation, posting or distribution of material, handbills, printed or written literature of any kind,
including internet or phone communications, by an employee to another employee is prohibited during
working time and in all employee working areas. Working time does not include non-work time such as ,
scheduled breaks and the time before and after a shift. Individuals who are not employees of the
Company may not solicit, post or distribute on Company property at any time, whether or not the
property consists of a work area or non-work area.

**Failure to follow a supervisor’s or manager’s work direction**
Teamwork is essential to provide our customers with sensational service each and every time they shop.
When a supervisor or manager asks you to do something, it is your responsibility to carry out that
assignment in a professional and timely manner. If you disagree with a supervisor’s or manager’s
instructions, we ask that you carry out the instructions providing they are not unlawful or in violation of
a Company policy, and at first opportunity, take your concerns to the next higher level of management
for further discussion.

**Computer usage**
The Company provides its employees with a variety of resources so that employees may perform their
jobs. These resources and any files, materials, documents and/or data transmitted by or stored in or on
them, are the sole property of Lund Food Holdings, Inc. and are intended for business use. As a general
principle, we encourage all employees to effectively utilize the technology that is available through the
Company to enhance both personal and professional effectiveness. As you access and utilize our
technology, we ask that you commit to applying the same level of professionalism that is expected in all
workplace communications. Any personal or other use the Company deems inappropriate or excessive
may result in discipline up to and including termination at the discretion of the Company.

E-mail you send and receive or internet sites you access are subject to the same business
professionalism that would be applied to any form of written or spoken communication that occurs at
work. Manage personal utilization so as not to disrupt your work or diminish productivity. Restrict
personal e-mail or internet/intranet access to non-work hours such as breaks or meal periods, and to

---

subject matter that is appropriate to the business environment. Employees must not engage in any
computer-related conduct that violates the law, violates any Company policy, reflects poorly upon
employees and/or the Company, is inconsistent with the Company’s interests or incurs any cost to the
Company. Inappropriate use includes, but is not limited to, copying, transmitting or accessing
pornographic or otherwise offensive pictures, materials or messages; insensitive jokes; defamatory
comments or materials; virus propagation; or other abuse or misuse of Company equipment and other
resources. Employees also should not send, receive or transmit by any means copyrighted materials,
trade secrets, confidential or proprietary information, financial information, or other such information
without prior authorization.

The nature of e-mail sometimes causes users to act as though they are engaged in a face-to-face
conversation and, consequently, causes users to be casual or careless in their communication. E-mail is
not a face-to-face conversation and it is not private. E-mail results in a documented record that can be
printed, shared with others, and retrieved months or years later, even if it has been deleted.
Accordingly, employees should use the same care and good judgment in their e-mail that they would
use in any written communication.

The Company reserves the right to inspect, monitor, review, retain, disclose, and/or use (collectively
referred to as “access”) computers, documents, e-mail messages (both incoming and outgoing), and files
(both computer and paper) in its sole discretion, notwithstanding any employee’s use of passwords. Any
e-mail, information, files, data, or other material or property of any kind inspected, accessed or
monitored by the Company may be disclosed and/or used as the Company deems appropriate.

Computer software that is provided by the Company is the property of the Company and should be used
for business purposes. Only software purchased and installed by an information services representative
can be used on Company computers. To avoid illegal reproduction and use of Company software
applications, no Company-owned software can be taken home to be used on personal computers unless
an information services representative has given prior written authorization. Periodic audits will be
conducted to ensure that the Company is in compliance with software licensing agreements and that no
unauthorized use of Company owned or personal software is occurring.

Computer hardware that is provided by the Company is the property of the Company and should remain
on the premises and used for business purposes only. Laptop computer workstations are portable and
may be taken off the premises as needed to complete business activities.

Selecting a personal computer password that cannot be easily guessed by anyone else and changing
passwords frequently are important steps that you can take to protect the security of your personal and
our corporate computer files. Do not reveal your password to anyone or allow anyone to observe you
entering your password. Any written record of your password should be kept hidden. Ensure that your
workstation is reasonably secure in your absence. Please log off or lock your computer when you leave
the room.

For further clarification, please review the Computer Usage Policy, or contact an information services or
human resources representative.

specific uniform requirements. Your location manager or department manager will provide you with
information that covers the dress and grooming requirements in your area. For a more detailed
overview, you can refer to the dress and grooming policy.

We understand that there may sometimes be occurrences—both planned and unplanned—that may
cause you to be late, need to leave early, or even miss a scheduled shift. When this occurs, we expect
you to notify your manager as far in advance of your shift as possible so other coverage arrangements
can be made. Unreliable attendance will compromise our service levels and may ultimately impact your
continued employment with the Company. For more information and specific details, please see the

**HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME, AND EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS**
Hours of work, overtime, and employment classifications are explained in detail in the LFHI non-union
benefits summary or your applicable union contract. Note that for overtime purposes, the work week is
defined as Monday through Sunday, or as noted per your Union contract. Questions regarding hours of
work, overtime, and employment classifications should be directed to your location manager or the
human resource department.

**JOB DESCRIPTIONS**
Job descriptions are available for many positions. They contain valuable information about a position’s
purpose, essential functions and primary responsibilities. Ask your manager for a copy of the job
description for your position. As your position changes and evolves, be sure to note those changes on
the job description and advise your manager so revisions can be made.

**WORK SCHEDULES**
In most retail and production facilities the work schedules will be posted in advance. If you would like to
request a change in your work schedule, you will need to notify your manager one week prior to the
posting of the new schedule. Complete consideration will be given to all scheduling requests in
conjunction with consideration for the needs of the business.

Work schedules for office positions will be communicated to you by your manager. These work
schedules generally remain consistent from week to week. If you would like to change your work
schedule, please discuss it with your manager as early as possible. Your request will receive
consideration along with consideration for the coverage and production needs of the department.

**BREAK PERIODS**
The Company provides all employees with the opportunity to enjoy paid break periods and unpaid break
periods. Since we have employees who work a variety of shifts, both full and part-time, specific break
assignments will be communicated to you by your manager. To avoid service interruptions, it is
important for everyone to closely adhere to their scheduled break periods.

**TIME CLOCK USE**
If you are in a position that is paid by the hour, you will be asked to record your time by using a time
clock or other timekeeping device. All hours worked must be recorded on the time clock or timekeeping
device; working off the clock is not allowed. It is important that you clock in slightly prior to the start of
your shift so you are ready to work at your scheduled start time. Advance approval from your manager
is required if you plan on working hours other than those that have been scheduled for you.

To assure that there is no interruption in customer service, we ask that you do not leave your work area
to clock out until the time that your scheduled shift ends. If you work in a retail or production facility
where continuing operations are essential, please do not leave your work area unattended if there is no
one to relieve you; rather, call a manager for assistance. It is important that you follow accurate
timekeeping procedures for starting and ending times as well as paid rest breaks and unpaid breaks.
Your manager will explain this process in greater detail.

Your time record indicates what you believe to be an accurate account of the schedule and hours that
you have worked in a given pay period. Misrepresenting your hours in any way, falsifying your time

---

record, allowing someone else to clock in or out for you, or clocking in or out for someone else is strictly
prohibited and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. If you
have any questions about timekeeping, please discuss them with your department manager or location
manager.

**COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY**
We are committed to providing a wage level that is equal to or greater than the prevailing wage rate in
the community for similar jobs. As part of that commitment, we are constantly evaluating wage levels
for all positions and comparing them to prevailing wages in our community. All positions have assigned
wage ranges either through union contracts or our LFHI compensation program. Questions concerning
wage levels can be brought to your location manager or the human resource department.

**PAYMENT OF WAGES**
Our payroll department creates several thousand paychecks each pay cycle. To accomplish this
important responsibility, they must have accurate and complete pay record information from every
employee. If you have an address change, name change, marital status change, change in withholdings
or any other change that would affect your paycheck, please update your information within the MyLFHI
website. If you receive a paycheck that is inaccurate, return it to your manager so the error can be
corrected and a new check issued.

**PAYDAY**
We are paid every two weeks on Friday for the work performed in the preceding two weeks. The longest
period of time that a new employee would wait for a paycheck would be three weeks. This would occur
if you started during the second week of a pay-period. In that case you would work the week you started
and the next two weeks. The check that you receive at the end of your third week would represent
wages for the time worked during the preceding two weeks.

**DIRECT DEPOSIT**
We offer a direct deposit service to our employees. This enables you to have your pay automatically
deposited. On payday, you will receive an earnings statement within the MyLFHI site which itemizes
your gross pay, deductions and withholdings and lists your net pay. Instead of receiving a check, the
money will already be in your designated account on the date of the payday, available for your use at
the start of business on payday morning. Contact your manager or location manager for more
information about this service.

**NO TIPPING**
Though our customers are generous and can be persistent in wanting to give a monetary tip, the
Company has a strict no tipping practices for all positions except restaurant servers and catering
employees. It is expected you would politely and respectfully decline and remind our customers that,
“this is a complimentary service, and it is my pleasure to provide you with this service. There is no need
to tip.”

###### VI. FACILITIES AND SERVICE

Parking is available at or around each worksite. Many of our facilities share parking with customers or
other tenants; there will be areas designated for employee parking. Your manager will advise you on the
exact location of employee parking for your worksite. It is very important that you park in designated
employee parking areas only.

**BREAKROOMS / RESTROOMS**
Each facility is equipped with clean and comfortable breakrooms and restrooms for your use.

###### VII. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

**OPEN-DOOR POLICY**
We believe that maintaining open lines of communication between all employees is essential to
objectively consider employee suggestions, resolve differences, and provide for the general well-being
of the employees and the Company. In support of this commitment, we maintain an open-door policy
which provides the opportunity for any employee to ask questions directly of their supervisor,
department head, store manager, general manager, any member of the management team and/or any
human resources representative at any time, about anything, and receive a response. You can be
assured that the Company will constructively work to earn and maintain your respect by giving your
individual needs consideration and review.

Members of management and human resources have the responsibility to respond quickly and clearly to
any questions asked of them to ensure clarity and understanding throughout the Company, and to the

---

extent reasonably possible and in its discretion, to preserve the confidentiality of the open-door
process. Every employee is encouraged to take full advantage of this right, without fear of reprisal or
retaliation. When you do have a question or concern, your supervisor is in the best position to respond
quickly and accurately and should generally be the first person that you approach. However, if you are
uncomfortable addressing the concern with your supervisor or if you want further clarification, you are
free to speak with any other management person in our Company regardless of title.

**PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK**
Performance feedback comes in many forms, from an informal discussion with your manager to a more
formalized goal setting process. Performance feedback is an essential component of a healthy work
environment.

The orientation follow-up provides an opportunity for a new employee or newly promoted employee to
discuss job performance, job satisfaction, training needs and performance goals with his/her manager. It
is an excellent time to clarify priorities, realign training, and/or acquire a greater understanding about
the job, the department and the Company.

Performance and development feedback provide you with the opportunity to review your
accomplishments and establish goals. These discussions help ensure that your priorities are aligned with
your department’s priorities and the Company’s priorities. These discussions are also an excellent time
to review your personal career objectives and training needs with your manager. Please be open and
candid during these discussions, as this will help you and your manager build a positive working
relationship.

Informal feedback should occur throughout the year and can occur at any time. Do not hesitate to ask
your manager for a meeting to review your performance. You can prepare for this meeting by writing
down some questions or topics that you would like to discuss with your manager in advance of the
meeting.

**SERVICE AWARDS**
Your continued service with the Company is highly valued and will be recognized with a selection of gifts
beginning on your five-year anniversary with the Company and every five years thereafter. On your
anniversary, your manager will present you with an award and your gift will be mailed to your home
address. When celebrating fifteen years of service or greater, your award will be presented at a special
service recognition luncheon hosted by an executive officer of the Company.

**EMPLOYMENT RECORDS**
The Company maintains employment files for each employee. These files contain pay record
information such as current withholdings, wage rates, and your employment application. It also contains
benefit information, including beneficiary designations and performance information such as
performance appraisals, commendations and disciplinary notices. Access to these files is limited to
management personnel who have a legitimate reason to review data contained in the file.

You may review the contents and/or request a copy of your employment file once every six months.
Your written request will be responded to within seven (7) working days. If you dispute any information
contained in your file, you may submit a written statement for inclusion in your file explaining your

---

position. After you leave employment with the Company, you may review your file once annually via
written request to the human resource department for as long as we maintain your records.

By asserting your rights as noted above, there is no retaliation on the part of the Company. If you have
any questions concerning access to your employment records, please contact a human resources
representative.

The online communications are a way to stay informed of Company news. They will tell you about
current happenings in the Company. You will find information which contains employee promotions and
transfers throughout the Company.

###### VIII. CAREER DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT**
We take great pride in our commitment to employee development and advancement. Most of our
senior positions are filled through the internal advancement of our employees. Talk to any of your
coworkers or managers and you are likely to hear that they started in an entry-level position and worked
their way through a variety of jobs in the Company. We have a number of important programs to help
you achieve your career goals.

To be considered for a posted position, you must meet the basic qualifications for the job and have a

**TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES**
Our training includes a wide variety of skill-building programs ranging from leadership and team building
to safe food handling and evening manager programs. Look for training programs and schedules online

and/or other positions, including mentoring, with the Company.

We encourage our employees to seek out and develop mentoring relationships with others in the
organization who can help them enhance their skills and achieve their career goals.

**EDUCATION ASSISTANCE**
Continuing education is an activity that we encourage and applaud. In support of our employees who

Minnesota’s food industry by virtue of their parents’ employment or their own part-time employment
by companies which are members of the Minnesota Grocers Association (MGA). Second, it helps
deserving students with some college expenses. Third, it indirectly aids the colleges attended by the
recipients, and fourth, it improves the morale of the employees of companies which are members of the
MGA. Please refer to the General Information for the MGA which is posted each January or call the
human resource department for more information.

###### IX. TIME OFF BENEFITS
We recognize that there may be times when personal or medical reasons create a need for you to be
away from work for an extended period of time. In such situations, the Company has a variety of leave
programs that may offer you the opportunity to take your leave while maintaining your employment
with the Company. The information on these pages provides a brief description of the various leave of
absence programs. For more information consult the leave of absence policy, your manager and/or
union contract.

**REQUESTING A LEAVE:**
To apply for a leave, the employee must notify his or her manager and The Hartford. The Company
requests all leaves be initiated 30 days in advance of the leave providing the need for leave was
foreseeable. Medical related leaves require a physician’s statement certifying the reason for the request
and may require periodic updates throughout the leave period.

**FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT**
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides employees with the opportunity to take up to weeks of unpaid leave of absence when necessary as a result of the birth or the placement through
adoption or foster care of a child and the care for such child, or a serious health condition affecting the
employee or certain members of his/her immediate family. The 12 weeks of FML may be taken once in a
12 month period providing a qualifying event occurs. The 12 month leave period is a rolling 12 months,
measured backward from the date FML was last taken. Eligibility for FML requires 12 months of service
working a minimum of 1,250 hours during the 12 month period immediately before the requested leave
begins.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| away from work for an extended period of time. In such situations, the Company has a variety of leave |
| programs that may offer you the opportunity to take your leave while maintaining your employment |
| with the Company. The information on these pages provides a brief description of the various leave of |
| absence programs. For more information consult the leave of absence policy, your manager and/or |
| union contract. |

---

An employee is required to provide the Company and The Hartford with notice of the need for FML calendar days in advance, or as soon as is practical.

During an FML, the Company continues to pay the employer’s portion of your medical, dental and life
insurance benefits. Retirement contributions are suspended during an FML, as are all other benefits
such as vacation, PTO and holidays. Your union contract or the LFHI non-union benefits summary will
provide further information regarding the impact of FML on vacation, holidays, personal holidays, and
PTO benefits. In addition, you will be able to substitute earned paid leave during the unpaid portion of
your FML leave.

The Hartford will require a physician’s statement certifying the reason for the FML request and may
require periodic updates throughout the leave period. The Hartford may require recertification on a
reasonable basis in compliance with the law. If The Hartford has reason to doubt the validity of the
certification, it may require, at the Company’s expense, that a second opinion be obtained from a health
care provider of its choosing. If the second opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification,
then The Hartford may require, at the Company’s expense, that you obtain the opinion of a third health
care provider designated or approved jointly by you and the Company. The opinion of the third health
care provider shall be final and binding.

At the end of your FML, the Company will restore you to the position you held before your leave started
or to an equivalent position, except as provided under applicable law. In addition, while you are on FML,
The Hartford and the Company may require you to periodically report on your status and intention to
return to work.

Typically, when you are on FML, you may not engage in other work or employment. In rare cases we
may allow this, but you must have prior approval from both your supervisor or manager and human
resources. If you engage in other work or employment during your leave without prior approval from
your supervisor or manager and human resources, you will be considered to have violated the terms of
your leave and to have voluntarily terminated your employment.

Employees who elect not to return to work upon expiration of their FML will be required to reimburse
the Company for employer-paid benefit contributions, and their employment will be terminated as of
the date of FML expiration unless the employee is on an approved medical or personal leave. For more
information, please contact your location manager or human resource representative.

**MEDICAL LEAVE**
A medical leave of absence will be granted to employees who are restricted from working due to a
disabling illness or injury upon receipt of sufficient information from a medical provider that verifies the
disabling condition and the need for medical leave. The length of leave will be governed by medical
necessity as determined by a physician’s certification. The employee may be asked to provide periodic
medical status reports referencing his/her current work restrictions and the Company may require the
employee to return to work if work within the employee’s restrictions is available.

Insurance and retirement programs are suspended during a medical leave of absence except for periods
of medical leave that are also covered by FML, whereby the employer’s portion of medical, dental and
life insurance premiums will continue to be paid. When FML is not available, the opportunity to continue
insurance coverage will be made available at the employee’s cost in accordance with the terms and
conditions of COBRA.

---

As with FML, The Hartford may require recertification on a reasonable basis in compliance with the law.
If The Hartford has reason to doubt the validity of the certification, it may require, at the Company’s
expense, that you obtain the opinion of a second health care provider of its choosing. If the second
opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification, then The Hartford may require, at the
Company’s expense, that you obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved
jointly by you and the Company. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be final and binding.

Vacation, holiday, personal holiday, and PTO benefits are not accrued during a medical leave of absence
except for those that may be covered under FML, when the FML period runs concurrently with the
medical leave of absence period. Employment with the Company will be terminated if the medical leave
of absence extends beyond 12 months unless otherwise stated in the union contract. While medical
leaves of absence are unpaid, some of our positions offer short and/or long-term disability or income
replacement coverage. To learn more about these options, refer to your LFHI non-union benefit
summary or applicable union contract.

**PERSONAL LEAVE**
Personal leaves of absence are unpaid leaves and may be granted for employees requesting an
extended period away from the job due to compelling personal reasons. Personal leaves must be
requested in writing and submitted in advance to your department manager or location manager, then
contact The Hartford. Consideration will be given to all personal leave requests and providing the
business and coverage issues can be met with no interruption of service or additional cost incurred,
every effort will be made to accommodate the request. Vacation, holiday, personal holiday, and
personal time off (PTO) benefits are not accrued during a personal leave of absence. Medical and related
insurance programs as well as all retirement programs are suspended during a personal leave of
absence. COBRA coverage for continuing insurance will be made available at the employee’s cost. All
benefits will be reinstated upon return from an approved personal leave of absence. The maximum
length of personal leave is explained in the LFHI non-union benefit summary or applicable union
contract.

**SICK OR INJURED CHILD CARE LEAVE**
An eligible employee is allowed to use his/her sick leave and/or PTO benefits for absences due to the
illness or injury of the employee’s child on the same terms the employee is able to use the sick leave and
PTO benefits for his/her own illness or injury. To be eligible, you must be employed at least consecutive months immediately preceding the request, and have worked an average number of hours
per week equal to at least one-half the equivalent of a full-time employee in the same job classification.
When the need for this leave is foreseeable, you must provide reasonable prior notice to your manager.
For more information, please see your location manager or speak with a human resources
representative.

**PREGNANCY AND PARENTING LEAVE**
An employee who has worked for the Company for at least 12 months preceding a request for
pregnancy or parenting leave and who has worked an average of 20 hours per week or more during the
12 months preceding such a leave request is eligible for leave related to the birth or adoption of a child,
and, in the case of a female employee, for prenatal care or incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, or
related conditions. Such female employees are also eligible for reasonable accommodations for health
conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.

---

The employee must contact The Hartford to request such leave concurrent with their FML or medical
leave. The Hartford will notify the employee and location representative in writing if the leave is
approved or denied.

**SCHOOL CONFERENCE LEAVE**
An eligible employee has up to 16 hours during the 12 month period beginning September 1 and ending
August 31 to attend school conferences or school-related activities related to the employee’s child,
provided the conferences or the school-related activities cannot be scheduled during non-work hours. If
the employee’s child receives child care services or attends a pre-kindergarten regular or special
education program, you may use this leave time to attend a conference or activity related to your child
or to observe the services, provided that the activity cannot be scheduled during non-work hours. When
the need for this leave is foreseeable, you must provide reasonable prior notice to your manager. This
leave is not paid but you have the right to substitute any earned paid leave for any part of the approved
leave request.

**MILITARY LEAVE**
An employee may take time off from work to fulfill annual military training obligations. Employees called
into active duty will be placed on an unpaid leave, and upon their release from active duty, will be
reinstated to the same or similar position in accordance with the federal law. Vacation, holiday, personal
holiday, and PTO benefits are not accrued during a military leave of absence. Medical and related
insurance programs as well as all retirement programs are suspended during a military leave of absence.
COBRA coverage for continuing insurance will be made available at the employee’s cost.
Re-employment and all benefits will be reinstated upon return from an approved military leave of
absence in full compliance with the federal law.

**RETURNING TO WORK FROM AN APPROVED LEAVE OF ABSENCE**
You must be available to return to work on the first scheduled day following the expiration of your leave
of absence. You must also have your return to work documentation completed prior to your return.
Failure to return from leave as scheduled will result in termination of employment unless other
arrangements were made between you and your manager in advance of the expiration of the leave.

It is the Company’s intent to accommodate an employee who is returning from an approved leave by
restoring them to the same, or an equivalent, position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms
and conditions of employment held prior to his or her leave. Please note, changes in the business
climate that result in restructuring, job elimination, layoffs, etc., may prohibit such accommodation from
occurring.

Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day, and for non-union full-time

please consult your applicable union contract or the LFHI non-union benefit summary.

**PAID TIME OFF FOR NON-UNION EMPLOYEES**
Our LFHI non-union benefit package provides a paid time off benefit (PTO) that begins following the first
month of employment. Under this program, you earn a specified number of hours for each month that
you work for the Company. This time can be taken as it is earned or accumulated throughout the year.
Your LFHI non-union benefit summary provides specific details covering PTO eligibility and earning
levels.

**VACATION AND HOLIDAYS**
Each union contract contains provisions for paid time-off under the vacation and floating/personal
holiday benefit. Please refer to your applicable union contract to learn more about eligibility and earning
levels for each of these benefits.

**USE OF PAID TIME OFF AND CARRY OVER**
Calendar holidays and floating/personal holidays must be used in the year that they are earned.
Vacation and PTO benefits can be carried forward into the next year providing the total balance of
unused vacation or PTO does not exceed twice your annual earning level.

**SICK AND SAFE TIME**
Eligible employees working 80 hours or more in qualifying locations will accrue sick and safe time (SST).
Sick time is for an employee or family member’s mental or physical illness including preventative
medical care. Safe time is for reasons related to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, school
closures due to inclement weather or other public safety issues for an employee or their family member.
Eligible employees can accrue up to 48 hours per year and carry over up to 80 hours of unused time per
year. For more information please refer to the addendum included in this handbook, see your location

**JURY DUTY LEAVE**
All employees are entitled to take time off for jury duty. If you are summoned to jury duty, the Company
will continue your regular pay during your active jury duty days up to a maximum of 21 days per
calendar year. If the need to be away from work continues beyond the 21 day period, you will be placed
on unpaid leave of absence and you may choose to then use your earned paid time-off benefit. If at any
time during this unpaid leave you do not receive a paycheck, you are responsible for personal payment
of your portion of the medical/dental/life insurance premium payments.

---

Part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work more than 20 hours per week will be eligible
for compensation for the portion of jury duty that conflicts with their regularly scheduled work hours,
unless other accommodations can be made.

Please provide your manager with a copy of the notification of your summons to jury duty and proof of
service days when your active service has been completed. In addition, you must report for work
whenever your presence is not required by the court during your scheduled work hours.

The Company will comply with all applicable state laws regarding jury duty.

**TIME-OFF TO VOTE**
We encourage every employee of voting age to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in
elections. You are entitled to take reasonable paid time off to vote in a regularly scheduled election. You
are not required to use any of your earned time off to cover the time voting.

You are expected to use the time away from work for the purpose of voting. The Company is allowed to
request that you provide proof that you voted and give the name of the precinct where you cast your
ballot. This voting leave does not include local or municipal elections.

In addition, if you are selected to serve as an election judge, you must give the Company at least calendar days written notice and this notice must be accompanied by a certification from the appointing
authority stating the hourly compensation and the hours to be served. The Company will provide the
time off per the certification and pay the difference, if any, between the election judge pay and your
regular pay.

resign from the Company, we would like you to provide us with a minimum of two weeks advance
notice. When you leave, you will be asked to turn in any uniforms, keys, Company property, your
employee identification card, Company credit cards, and you will be asked to repay any outstanding
debts and advances as well as any tuition assistance payments that were made to you during the
previous 12 months. All resignations should be submitted in writing and presented to your manager. The
Company reserves the right to provide pay for your notice period in lieu of working during your notice
period and reserves the right to withhold from your final paycheck the cost of Company property not
returned or any outstanding debt you owe the Company.

To allow sufficient time to prepare the information, please provide 90 days notice in advance of your
planned retirement date. Your notice of retirement should be presented to your manager in writing.

If you walk off the job, fail to report for your scheduled shifts without notifying your manager, fail to
provide adequate notice as part of your resignation, or fail to report to work at the end of an authorized
leave of absence, the Company will consider you to have resigned without notice and you will not be
eligible for rehire.

**EXIT INTERVIEWS**
Exit interviews are conducted when employees leave our Company. From time to time, employees who
have left our Company may expect to receive an exit interview. This is a valuable form of feedback that
helps us learn what we can do better to ensure that our employees choose to stay with us rather than
working for another employer.

**BENEFIT CONVERSION OPTIONS**
If you were participating in a Company-sponsored health insurance, dental insurance, or life insurance
program, you will be provided with an opportunity to continue that coverage at your own expense
under the terms and conditions of COBRA. For more information concerning this coverage, please

administrator.

of their peers. To learn more about DRP, contact your manager or a human resources business partner.

**TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF AND TAKING CARE OF OTHERS**
Let’s face it, we seldom think about the possibility of sustaining a disabling injury while at work. But all it
takes is one little misstep, miscalculation or mistake and your life or another’s can be forever changed.

The things that matter most — your health, your family, play time and work — can all be compromised
in an instant. Your personal safety cannot be taken for granted — it’s something that you need to work
at and we hope you will.

The information that follows represents our guidelines to help ensure your personal safety and the
safety of others.

Please take the time to read this information and discuss any questions with your manager or safety
representative.

**Did You Know?**

 Regardless of our job titles, we all have the same three job responsibilities:

1. Keep the environment safe and clean.
2. Create sensational service for our customers.
3. Do the job you were hired to do.

**Did You Know?**

 You can help prevent accidents by correcting a hazard when you see one or telling your
manager about it?

**SAFETY RESOURCES**
**Reporting Injuries** **–** If you’re injured on or off the job, let your manager know right away. If your injury
is work-related, he or she will want to help you and take care of any hazards. Your manager will ask you
to participate in an accident investigation to help us prevent similar incidents. He or she will also
complete paperwork to investigate and document the injury.

If you need medical care, you’ll be referred to the designated clinic and be asked to bring back a return-
to-work form from the physician.

If you have physical restrictions that limit the type of work you can do, your manager may assign you to
a Temporary Alternate Duty (TAD) job until you’re able to return to your regular assignment. This allows
you to continue working during your recovery.

Finally, if you’ve missed time, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Once again, your
manager will help you with this process.

**Safety Committee** **–** The safety committee’s role is to help make your workplace safe and prevent
accidents from happening. They meet monthly to review accidents, injuries and prevention
opportunities. They also help with safety training. The committee can’t do its job alone. They need you
to work safe and tell them about any safety suggestions or concerns you may have. If you’d like to get
involved with the committee, tell your manager you’d like to volunteer.

**Asset Protection** **–** The Company’s asset protection department is responsible for providing guidance
and direction to our facilities on injury prevention and safety programs. Asset protection employees are
also available to assist store employees in the event you have a safety or security question or concern.
This department can be contacted by looking in the Company phone directory.

**First Aid** **–** When an accident occurs, alert the manager on duty for help.
 Call 911 for medical emergencies
 Know where the first-aid kit is located
 Avoid moving an injured person unless it’s to get him/her away from danger

**Helping a Coworker Stay Safe** **–** If you see someone not working safely, point it out to him or her or tell
your manager. For example, if you see someone not lifting properly, show them how to lift safely.

**Did You Know?**

 If you haven’t been trained on how to use a piece of equipment, a chemical or how to
complete a task, don’t proceed — ask your manager for assistance.

**PERSONAL SAFETY**
**Training** **–** You’ll receive special training throughout your employment to help keep you and others safe:
 Orientation
 Department training
 As job or procedure changes
 Annual training

Remember, if you haven’t been trained on how to use a piece of equipment, a chemical or how to
complete a task, don’t proceed — ask your manager for assistance.

**Age-Restricted Work Activities** **–** If you’re under 18, there are special laws designed to protect you
against injury while at work. You cannot drive delivery vehicles or operate compactors, balers, slicers,
saws, mixers and grinders, nor can you change cooking oil or clean machinery, including slicers. You also
cannot sell liquor. The law prohibits these activities.

If you’re under 16, in addition to the activities listed above, you cannot unload trucks, work in freezers,
work on ladders, cook, or operate pallet jacks.

**Age-Restricted Products** **–** There are special laws designed to limit youth access to age-restricted
products such as alcohol. Our Company strongly supports these guidelines. If your job involves the sale
of these products, you’ll participate in training that covers guidelines you need to follow.

For example, we require our customers to present identification to verify that they are at least 21 years
old to purchase alcohol. The cashier or server must verify that the customer is of legal age to purchase
these products.

Not following these guidelines can be expensive for you and the Company. You can be subject to costly
fines and legal fees and the Company could be fined and lose its license to sell these products. If you
have any questions about this information, please ask your manager for assistance.

**Personal Security** **–** Always be aware of your surroundings when you arrive or leave the worksite,
especially after daylight hours. Whenever possible, walk with someone else or ask for an escort, and
take care and know exactly where you’ve parked before you head for your car.

When leaving your vehicle unattended, always lock the doors no matter how soon you plan to return.
Do not leave personal belongings in plain view. When returning, have the door key in your hand and
look around to be aware of your surroundings.

If you see threatening behavior or violence in the area or at your worksite, call 911 when it is safe to do
so. Report it as an emergency. Never attempt to intervene in the event of a robbery, scuffle or a fight.
Remember, your personal safety and the safety of others is far more important than any amount of
money or property. Protect yourself first and get help by calling 911.

**Shoplifting and Thef** **t –** Never attempt to confront, stop or question someone you suspect of shoplifting
or theft; it is unsafe and dangerous to do so. Instead, if you see anyone — customer or employee — take
and conceal merchandise, alert your manager immediately. And remember, the best deterrent to
shoplifting is providing good customer service.

*Respect, honesty and integrity, empowerment, innovation, safety, development and communication are*
*Company values that we bring to life by supporting them and practicing them.*

**Did You Know?**

 Your personal safety and the safety of others is far more important than any amount of
money or property.
 Don’t become a statistic. Work safe, play safe, have fun!

**ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY**
**Housekeeping in your Surroundings** **–** Keep it clean, neat and orderly. At work, just as at home, if
everyone doesn’t pitch in, housekeeping becomes impossible. When you come across a spill or potential
hazard, pick it up, clean it up, don’t pass it up. Report hazards that you cannot resolve immediately to
your manager.

Preventing accidents and injuries is all about having a keen pair of eyes and being observant in your
work area. Take responsibility for keeping your workplace safe.

**Warning Signs** **–** They tell us about a possible danger. Know what they mean and follow them. Examples
of common warning signs include: “Caution, Wet Floor” or “Danger, Do Not Operate.”

**Fire Prevention** **–** Making sure fires don’t happen is a matter of being alert. If you see items stored too
close to a heat source, move them and tell your manager. If you see cords being used unsafely, tell your
manager. Keep exits free and unobstructed. Keep your eyes open for fire hazards, then correct and
report them if you see them.

If a fire does occur, you’ll need to do one or more of the following:
 Call  Alert the manager and coworkers
 Use an extinguisher if it is safe and you have been properly trained
 Evacuate the building
*Most important, keep yourself and others safe.*

To use a fire extinguisher:
**P** ull the pin
**A** im at the base
**S** queeze the trigger
**S** weep side to side

**When the Lights Go Out** **–** In the event of a power outage, there are three things you should do:
 Secure the building — be sure emergency lights are on
 Take care of the customers — ensure their safety
 Secure the product — see your manager for instructions and assistance

**Did You Know?**

 Slip-and-fall accidents can be prevented by following good housekeeping practices and being
observant.
 We’re all responsible for safety. Work safe, play safe, have fun!

**Emergency Action Plan** **–** At times there may be an emergency situation such as threatening weather,
fire, bomb threat, chemical spill or another emergency when you may be asked to go to a safe area
inside or outside the building.

An emergency procedure flip chart is available and posted at each facility. Locate the flip chart at your
location and become familiar with its content.

**Working with Equipment and Hand Tools** **–** Before beginning work with any equipment:
 Inspect equipment
 Ensure safety guards are in place
 Follow standard operating procedures
 Obey warning signs
 Don’t operate defective equipment
 Lockout/tagout defective equipment
 Report defective equipment to your manager

**Lockout/Tagout** **–** Before cleaning, servicing or adjusting any powered equipment that exposes you to
moving parts, you must either unplug or lockout and tagout the equipment. This is designed to keep you
and others safe from the unexpected start-up or release of stored energy. If you work with certain
powered equipment, you’ll be trained on specific lockout/tagout procedures. Apply a lock and tag to any
equipment that needs repair and report it to your manager immediately. Never remove a tag or lock
from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so.

**Working with Sharp Objects** **–** If your job assignment requires you to use a box cutter, knife, slicer or
other sharp object, you’ll receive training that covers safe handling procedures. Some safety tips
include:
 Verify safety guards are in place
 Cut away from body
 Retract blade before storing or place in knife sheath or holder
 Wear cut-resistant gloves
 Store items securely
 Discard razor blades in designated container for disposal
 Never attempt to put hands, fingers or other body parts near or into moving equipment

**Did You Know?**

 Never remove a tag or lock from equipment unless you’re authorized to do so.
 Always check to see that equipment and tools are working properly.
 Apply lockout/tagout before cleaning or servicing powered equipment.
 Never put hands, fingers or other body parts into running equipment.

 Never place sharp objects or knives in soapy water

**Working with Chemicals** **–** Chemicals, when used properly and safely, pose no harmful effects. But when
spilled or used without caution, they can present a possible hazard to you and others in the work area.
You have the right to know about any chemical you encounter in the workplace. To learn about and
work safely with chemicals, refer to and follow guidelines on the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), listed
alphabetically and located in the Safety Center. You may receive a copy of a SDS by asking for one. If we
do not have a SDS for a product, we’ll request one from the supplier.

**Labels and SDS** **–** These provide you with important information to keep you and others safe. Take the
time to carefully read chemical labels and MSDS before you handle a chemical.

The Safety Data Sheets will tell you everything you need to know about a chemical, including if you need
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). It will also tell you about a chemical’s reactivity level or if the
chemical is stable. For example, if you mix household ammonia and bleach together, deadly chlorine gas
is produced. Never mix chemicals together that are not designed for mixing. If you find a container that
is not labeled, don’t use it and never smell it to determine its identity. Questions about a chemical? Ask
your manager.

**Personal Protective Equipment** **–** Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is designed to keep you safe
while working with chemicals or equipment, or during other work activities. Examples of PPE include eye
goggles, gloves and boots. Questions about PPE? Ask your manager where PPE can be found in your
department.

**Body Fluids** **–** Cleaning a restroom, cleaning up when someone has been sick, or helping bandage a cut
are activities that require you to take precautions.

For your personal safety, always wear gloves and other protective gear to ensure that you do not come
in contact with any type of body fluid. Bodily fluids such as blood, vomit, urine and feces are all
contaminates that may expose you to communicable diseases.

Wash thoroughly before and after removing gloves and engaging in these activities. If you come in
contact with bodily fluids, report it to your manager.

**Working with Pallet Jacks and Forklift Trucks** **–** The use of pallet jacks and forklift trucks is limited to
employees who have been trained and certified to use this equipment. Ask your manager about training

use.

**Hazardous Waste Program** **–** We take safety and our commitment to the environment seriously. In the
event of a chemical or hazardous waste spill, please dispose of these items properly using safe work
practices. Some items we sell cannot be discarded in the trash or poured down the drain. Please see a
manager for instructions and training on how to dispose of these items.

**Working Around Traffic** **–** Be especially careful while working in areas that have vehicle traffic. Look
both ways before entering a parking lot or parcel pickup area and be alert to warning signs such as
taillights, headlights and turn signals that may indicate a vehicle is preparing to move.

**Working in Warm Weather** **–** If you work outside or in a warm area during extreme heat, be sure to
drink plenty of water. Wear lightweight clothing and a hat. Tell your manager if you feel ill or nauseous,
vomit, sweat profusely or not at all, have a headache or any other symptoms. Also notify your manager
if you see any of these symptoms in a coworker as emergency medical attention may be needed.

To help combat the heat during extreme temperatures, we reduce exposure by providing extra breaks
through job rotation or rest periods, we supply and encourage drinking extra fluids, and we offer cool
break-time treats.

**Working in Cold Weather** **–** If you work outside during extreme cold weather, be sure to dress
appropriately — wear layers, a wind-resistant coat, hat, mittens or gloves, and warm, waterproof, slip-
resistant boots or shoes. Tell your manager if you feel ill or have any of these symptoms: tingling,
stinging, aching, itching, burning, pain or swelling. If you notice any of these symptoms in a coworker,
please let your manager know.

In extreme cold weather, we reduce exposure through task rotation and provide extra fluids.

**Business Driving** **–** If your job requires you to drive a Company vehicle or use your own, safety is
important. Make sure you:
 Hold a valid driver’s license
 Have insurance for your personal vehicle
 Are at least 18 years old
 Wear a seatbelt during operation
 Obey all traffic laws
 Adjust mirrors, seat and other necessary equipment

**Keeping Food Safe** **–** From the president of the Company to the front line employee, food safety is
everyone’s responsibility. The most important thing you can do in this area is to completely understand
and rigorously follow our hand-washing procedures.

If you work with perishable food, you’ll be asked to learn and demonstrate proper hand-washing
techniques, use of food safety gloves, product storage and cooling guidelines, and other procedures.
This will ensure that our food products are safe for consumption. This requires 100 percent compliance
from all of us. Please ask your manager if you have any questions about our food safety guidelines.

 Before putting on, or whenever changing, disposable gloves

**Not Feeling Well** **–** You’ve probably heard about viruses and other illnesses in the news such as the
Noroviruses, salmonella, E. coli and hepatitis A. These and other infections that cause diarrhea or
vomiting can be transmitted from you to customers through exposed food, equipment or utensils.

If you handle and work with food, you’re required by law to report to the **person in charge** if you have:
 Diarrhea or have been vomiting
 Jaundice
 A boil, infected wound or other lesion with pus
 Salmonella, shigella, E. coli 0157:H7 or other enteric pathogen

**JUST FOR YOU**
**Ergonomics and Simple Changes** **–** Ergonomics is about fitting the work environment to you. It’s looking
for ways to reduce awkward posture, high repetition, excessive force, vibration, and extreme
temperatures. Often simple solutions can make a job more comfortable while reducing the risk of injury.
For example, resting your foot on a grocery cart while cashiering, keeping your hands in a neutral
position while performing repetitive tasks, and using a long-handled utensil when scooping and stirring
products can increase your comfort.

Here are some tips to help protect you from repetitive injury:
 Stretch before beginning work activities
 Rotate tasks whenever possible
 Change position frequently — taking 10- second mini-breaks will help do this
 Avoid forceful movement
 Use both hands whenever possible
 Avoid excessive reaching
 Use a ladder or stepstool to reduce reach
 Change grips often
 Increase periods of repetitive motion to allow for physical conditioning
 Raise or lower work, if possible, to make it more comfortable

**Stretching and Mini-Breaks** **–** Stretching increases flexibility and helps to promote circulation and range
of motion while decreasing muscle stiffness and fatigue. When you do stretches, you ultimately
decrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static
stretching — which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-seconds — is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as “warm-ups”
to those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:

 Head/Neck Roll — Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling.
Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times.
 Shoulder Shrugs — Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles—up, forward,
down and backward. Repeat 3-5 times.
 Elbow Press for Middle Back — Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly
backward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times.
 Back Extension — Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for
support. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times.
 Leg Stretches — While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the
same with your left leg. Repeat 3-5 times.
 Wrist Circles — Slowly rotate hands up, down and around in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.
 Ankle Circles — One at a time, rotate ankles in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.

Caution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them.

**Keeping Your Back Injury-Free** **–** Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from
injury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items. Use these safe lifting
techniques:
 Stretch
 Lift safely
 Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like ***Shoes For Crews®***
— ask your manager about them.
 Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs.
 Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting.
 Know your limits — don’t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for
help; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips.

Regular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise
program, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises.

**Did You Know?**

 The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe
lifting techniques.
