###### Introduction

This handbook is designed to acquaint you with Buchheit and provide you with information about working
conditions, team member benefits, and some of the policies that affect you.

You should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. The Handbook describes
many of your responsibilities as a team member and outlines the programs we have developed to benefit our
team members. One of our objectives at Buchheit is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both
personal and professional growth.

No team member handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about every one of our policies.
Further, there may be situations where the need arises for us to revise, add, or cancel policies. Therefore,
Buchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The
only exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-at-
will policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will
notify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur.

###### Purpose of Handbook

The contents of this handbook are not intended to create a contract between Buchheit and any or all of its
team members. Rather, this handbook is provided only for the purpose of providing general information
about the company and its policies.

Buchheit reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change any or all such plans, policies or
procedures, in whole or in part, anytime with or without notice. Nothing herein is intended to create any type
of contract or guarantee of continued employment. Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be
discontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice.

###### The Buchheit Story

In 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local
farmers. No superhighways, no GPS units – just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family.

To make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back
home had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy’s efforts were an immediate hit, and
Buchheit Trucking was born.

Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with
a network connecting continents around the globe.

The Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores
offer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest.

Yet in spite of our success, we’ve never forgotten the simple principles that drove Rudy back in 1934: get it
there on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it “ ***Rudy’s way*** .” And no
matter how much farther down the road we go, we’ll never lose sight of it.

###### Customer Relations

Customers are Buchheit's most valuable assets. Each team member represents Buchheit to our Customers
and the public. The way we do our jobs presents an image of our entire organization. Customers judge us by
how they are treated each time they have contact with us. Therefore, one of our top business priorities is to
assist any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,
and prompt in the attention you give to customers. This applies to internal, as well as external, customers.

Buchheit will provide customer relations and services training to all team members who have extensive
customer contact. If a customer wishes to make a specific comment or complaint, you should direct that
person to the Manager on Duty for appropriate action. Remember that your contacts with the public in
person, over the telephone, and through all your communications reflect, not only on you, but on Buchheit as
a whole. Positive customer relations will not only enhance the public's image of Buchheit, but also pay off in
greater customer loyalty and increased sales and profit.

###### Buchheit Logistics, Our Promise

At Buchheit, we understand our customers have a choice when it comes to a logistics partner. And we
understand just how much they have riding on their decision. That’s why we make this promise to our
customers: Each and every day we commit to their success. From the first mile to the last, we will stand
with them to ensure that their products are cared for and delivered to their intended destination on time,
as promised. And, if for any reason they are ever dissatisfied, we will spare no effort to make it right.

Thanks for allowing us to serve our customers.

Sincerely,
*The Buchheit Logistics Team*

###### A Letter from Rudy

I am pleased that you have decided to join us here at Buchheit! A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to
make it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself
have taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today.

I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the
depression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant
loading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education
during these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to
buy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I
did not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25.

My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first
inventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of
salt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk.
Later, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they
would use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me.
They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy. In return, they would fill their baskets with goods they bought from me.

Back then, personalized service meant a lot to my customers, as it still does today. Since there was no advertising, the quality of
service was the best way to keep my customers loyal. By word of mouth, people began to learn of my business here.

In the beginning, I lived in the top of the store. In winter, it would get so cold, the soda bottles would freeze. In the summer, we would
open the doors to the stores for a breeze. However, outside was a dirt road, and the dust was so bad, it was almost better to leave the
doors shut.

I didn't have many employees - one or two. Many days, I would run the cash register, load customers in the yard, and talk to
salespeople. Things would get kind of hectic. During the evenings, I would still haul livestock to St. Louis, rent a bed in a rooming
house to sleep for a few hours, and come back home. I worked many 24-hour days.

A salesperson would call me every two weeks. I would order my supplies and would have to pay cash for what I needed right then.
When people would ask for an item, I would try to get it in stock. By filling my customers' needs, I built my inventory up to a business
with a reputation that, "we have everything you need."

If you have noticed, our emblem is a wagon wheel. This represents how teamwork is necessary for progress. The hub, or the center of
the wheel, can be viewed as team members pulling together to get things done, just as the hub holds the spokes together so the wheel
can be put into motion. If one spoke is missing, the wheel cannot work. The same is true for our business. If someone does not
contribute as a team member, our business cannot work. With teamwork, it is difficult to run a business today; however, without
teamwork, it is IMPOSSIBLE and will surely fail. The 11 spokes in this wheel represent each of my children.

Until the early 1960s, I never took a salary: all the profits went back into the business. I have 11 children. Putting food on the table
often meant using the outdated groceries from the store. When I think back, it seemed to be pretty hard work at times, and you didn't
have much time for yourself. But, I would not have done it if I didn't enjoy it.

When my children were big enough to start helping out, they were a big help! With their new ideas, things just seemed to keep
growing. We began to buy a little grain and things in other areas. Our trucking operation expanded to meet our needs, and today, we
are still servicing our customers with a fleet. The feed division has come a long way from the floral print bags. We now manufacture
Premium Brand feeds for the surrounding communities and other custom feeds for a distribution network.

In running this business, I have learned many things. One is that mistakes will be made. I feel that it is important to correct these
mistakes as they arise and to take care of our customers.

Our family has worked by this motto, which has turned into our business motto:

**Rule #1: The customer is always right.**
**Rule #2: When in doubt, refer to rule #1.**

No matter what your job is here at Buchheit, it is very important that you are honest, have a positive attitude, respect the company, and
respect the inventory, equipment, and the company's customers. These are the main contributions that make your paycheck possible.

I am proud of the history of our company and of the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire Buchheit team. I want you to
take pride in your job and enjoy being part of this team.

## Rudy Buchheit

take pride in your job, your company and yourself.

###### Employment Categories
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Understanding the definitions of the employment classifications at Buchheit is important because your
classification is one of the factors that determines your employment status and benefit eligibility. These
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Since employment with
Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment
relationship at will at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. All team members are in an
introductory period during their first 90 days of employment with us.

Depending on your position, you are designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state
wage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT team members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific
provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT team members are excluded from specific provisions of
federal and state wage and hour laws. Your EXEMPT and NONEXEMPT classification may be changed
only with written notification by Buchheit management. In addition to the Exempt and Nonexempt
categories, you also belong to one of the following employment categories:

FULL-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are regularly
scheduled to work the full-time schedule at Buchheit. Generally, regular full-time team members are eligible
for all Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.
Full-time team members need to work 1,560 hours in a calendar year to maintain their full-time status and
retain their benefits.

REGULAR PART-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are
regularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule, but at least 1,040 hours in a year. Regular
part-time team members are eligible for some Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions,
and limitations of each benefit program. Part-time team members who work more than 1,560 hours in a
calendar year will be considered full-time and will be eligible for full-time benefits.

PART-TIME team members are team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per
week. These team members may be employed in a temporary status. While part-time team members receive
all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are
ineligible for the other Buchheit benefit programs.

TEMPORARY team members are team members who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily
supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in
this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond the initially stated period does not in any way
imply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain that status unless, and until, they are
notified of a change. While temporary team members receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social
Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are ineligible for all other Buchheit benefit programs.

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR team members under contract or lease agreement with the company and
are not actual employees of the company. Independent contractors are ineligible for all Buchheit benefit
programs.

Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The Buchheit companies rely on the accuracy of the information provided on the employment application, as
well as the accuracy of other data presented during the hiring process and employment. If there are any
misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information, we may exclude that
applicant from further consideration. If the person was already hired, it could result in termination of
employment.

The Payroll Department will respond in writing when we receive a written request for a reference check. We
will confirm only employment dates and the positions held, in addition to any information required by law.
Buchheit will not release any employment data without a team member or former team member's written
authorization and signed release.

###### Equal Employment Opportunity
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment

disability, or any other characteristic protected by law.

We will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so
would result in an undue hardship. This policy covers all aspects of employment, including selection, job
assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.

If you have a question or concern about any type of discrimination in the workplace, you are encouraged to
bring the issue to the attention of your supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager. At Buchheit, be assured
that you can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Further, anyone found to be engaging
in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, termination
of employment.

###### Americans with Disabilities Act

major life activities;

###### Disability Accommodation
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring
equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities.

All employment practices and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Our hiring procedures
have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful employment opportunities. Pre-
employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's ability to perform the duties of the position.

We require post-offer medical examinations for positions that have bona fide job-related physical
requirements. An examination will be given to any person who enters the position but only after being given
a conditional job offer. Medical records are kept separate and confidential.

Reasonable accommodation is available to a team member with a disability if the disability affects the
performance of job functions. We make all employment decisions based on the merits of the situation in
accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual.

Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes
in compensation) as well as job assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions,
lines of progression, and seniority lists. We make leaves of all types available to all team members on an
equal basis.

Buchheit is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified team member or applicant because the
person is related to or associated with a person with a disability. Buchheit will follow any state or local law
that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA.

This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Buchheit is committed to taking all other actions necessary
to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the ADA and all
other applicable federal, state, and local laws.

**Essential Job Functions:** The Human Resources Department must identify the essential functions of the
position and prepare a job description that lists theses essential functions. The Human Resource Department
is responsible for keeping these job descriptions up-to-date and accessible.

| | 1. He or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his/her |

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_16_0.png)

**Safety Issues:** All employees must comply with safety rules at all times. The company makes every effort
to place applicants and employees in positions for which they are qualified. However, employees and job
applicants are not placed in positions where, with or without a reasonable accommodation, they would create
a direct threat to the safety or health or themselves or others.

The determination that an individual poses a direct safety or health threat must be confirmed by an opinion
in writing from a physician or other appropriate professional.

###### Drug and Alcohol Use
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit wants to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To meet this goal, we expect you to
report to work in a mental and physical condition that enables you to perform your job in a satisfactory
manner.

While on Buchheit premises or while conducting business-related activities off Buchheit premises, you may
not use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of illegal drugs. We permit the legal use of
prescribed drugs on the job only if they do not impair your ability to perform the essential functions of your
job effectively and safely without endangering others. You must report to your location manager if you have
been prescribed a prescription drug that may impair your ability to perform the essential functions of your
job, and you will not be allowed to operate a forklift, company vehicle, or any motorized equipment.

If you violate this policy, it may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of
your employment. Buchheit has a zero-tolerance policy for any positive drug or alcohol screen results while
conducting business on Buchheit property. If you violate this policy, your employment will be terminated. If
you violate this policy, there could also be legal consequences. Additionally, if you inform your location
manager of an issue with drugs or alcohol before a screening is requested, we may require you to participate
in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program.

If you have questions about substance dependency or abuse, we strongly encourage you to use the resources
of the Employee Assistance Program. You may also wish to discuss these matters with your supervisor or the
Loss Prevention Manager to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate community resources.

A team member with a drug or alcohol problem may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate
in a rehabilitation or treatment program through our health insurance benefit coverage, if the team member's
substance abuse problem has not already resulted in disciplinary action and the team member is not currently
subject to immediate disciplinary action. The time off may be granted if the team member agrees to abstain
from using the problem substance; abides by all Buchheit policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct
in the workplace; and if granting the time off will not cause Buchheit any undue hardship.

A team member must notify Buchheit of a criminal conviction for drug-related activity. The report must be
made within five days of the conviction.

If you have questions about this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use at work, you can raise your
concerns with your supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager without fear of reprisal.

###### Drug Testing
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all team members.
Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health risks.
To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and team members may be asked to
provide body substance samples (such as urine, breath, and/or blood) to check for the illicit or illegal use of
drugs and alcohol.

Drug testing is required as part of the post-offer, pre-employment process. Drug and alcohol testing
is required for " *safety-sensitive* " positions under DOT/FMCSA regulations, and for all team members
upon reasonable suspicion. A pending positive test result will result in a suspension until final results
are received. Test results for alcohol or drugs that are positive, or have been tampered with, will
result in immediate termination of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing will also result in
termination of employment. The cost of any positive drug or alcohol screen will be the responsibility of
the team member and will be deducted from the team member's paycheck.

Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) can provide confidential counseling and referral services to
team members who request assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. We
consider it the team member's personal responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP before a
disciplinary action is necessitated by problems with the team member's judgment, performance, or
behavior. While we support team members, using the EAP to get assistance, that may not prevent
Buchheit from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all team members. Also, team members will be asked
to sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy.

###### Team Member Medical Examinations
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/To help us make sure that you are able to perform your duties, Buchheit may require medical
examinations or WorkSTEPS testing of all team members. After we extend an offer to an applicant
entering a designated job, a medical examination or WorkSTEPS test will be performed at our expense by
a health professional of our choice; the offer of employment and assignment to duties is contingent upon
satisfactory completion

Current team members may be required to take medical examinations or WorkSTEPS tests to determine
their fitness for work. If an exam or test is needed, it will be scheduled at a reasonable time and interval and
at our expense. Such testing may be required before a change in work position or upon returning to
work after illness or injury. Refer to Section 6 for further information regarding our return to work
policy.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_18_0.png)

As a condition of employment, applicants (and current team members) agree to submit to alcohol and
controlled substance testing upon the request of employer with the following conditions to apply:

1. All DOT alcohol and controlled substance tests will be completed at a Buchheit Logistics approvedcollection site.

1. When the physician and/or Medical Review Officer (MRO) receives the results of the alcohol/controlledsubstance test, the results will be forwarded to Buchheit Logistics, who may review the results with any
persons directly involved with the hiring process, officers of the corporation and the corporate attorney.

1. Applicants testing positive for controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol that are not prescribed by aphysician will not be considered further for employment or will be dismissed immediately from
employment. If applicable, the cost of the alcohol/controlled substance test will be deducted from any
monies that may be owed to the individual.

1. Team members testing positive for any controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol will beimmediately removed from safety-sensitive activities and disciplined up to and including termination of
employment.

In addition, all persons applying for employment with Buchheit Logistics will be required to
successfully complete a functional employment test (WorkSTEPS). The cost of this procedure will be paid
by Buchheit Logistics. Below is the process that will be followed:

1. Applicants should report to the Recruiting Department to complete the necessary application forms.
2. Authorized team member will interview applicants.
3. Authorized team member will offer employment to those candidates deemed to be the most qualified andsuitable for the positions sought. The offers of employment will be contingent upon the successful
completion of a post offer drug/alcohol screen, functional employment test, and DOT mandated
background checks.

1. Upon receiving conditional offers of employment, applicants will be given written job descriptions andadditional written information regarding the post-offer/pre-placement test. After carefully reviewing
this information and/or consulting with their personal physicians, applicants must complete a
release authorizing Buchheit and WorkSTEPS to conduct the post-offer functional employment
tests. Requests for accommodations should be noted on the release. Depending on the nature
of the accommodation sought, further discussions and/or medical documentation may be needed to
identify an appropriate accommodation. Testing will be delayed until the interactive process aimed at
identifying appropriate and necessary reasonable accommodations is completed.

1. Once the company receives a fully completed release and any requests for reasonable accommodationsare resolved, the WorkSTEPS post-offer/pre-placement test will be scheduled.

1. Upon reporting to the licensed WorkSTEPS testing facility, applicants will be examined by a licensedoccupational or physical therapist and their staff.

1. Applicants who successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be informed of start dateand time to report for new hire orientation in Scott City, MO.

1. Applicants who fail to successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be notified.Because Buchheit Logistics seeks to make employment decisions based on the best available objective
medical evidence, applicants who fail tests should provide any additional information they believe
Buchheit Logistics should consider before withdrawing its conditional offer of employment.

**Additional Points:** The cost of the post-offer WorkSTEPS test is paid by Buchheit Logistics.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_19_0.png)

Medical information collected in connection with such tests will be maintained in confidential files in
accordance with requirements of the ***Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)*** and the information collected
will not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the ***ADA.***

Buchheit Logistics is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate against individuals on the
basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, disability or any other basis protected by federal, state
or local law.

Nothing in this policy is intended to be, and should not be construed as, a contract for any particular term or
condition of employment. Unless otherwise set forth in a written agreement signed by the
applicant/employee and Buchheit Trucking Service, individuals are employed “at will”. This means that
Buchheit Logistics and the applicant/employee could terminate the employment relationship at any time,
with or without notice. If you believe you are employed on something other than an “at will” basis, you
should advise Buchheit Logistics in writing. Failure to do so will be deemed by Buchheit Logistics as a
further indication that you and Buchheit Logistics agree that the employment relationship is “at will”.

###### Immigration Law Compliance
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are legally authorized to
work in the United Sates. We also do not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national
origin.

In order for us to comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, all new team members, as a
condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and provide
documentation that establishes their identity and eligibility for employment.

If you have questions or want more information on immigration law issues, you are encouraged to contact
the corporate Human Resources Department. At Buchheit, you can raise questions or complaints about
immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal.

###### Introductory Period
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/At Buchheit we want you to be successful at your job. We have found that having an introductory period can
be very helpful to new team members. The introductory period provides you with the opportunity to
demonstrate that you can perform your job at a satisfactory level of performance and to determine if the new
job meets your expectations. We use this period to evaluate your capabilities, work habits, and overall
performance.

Since employment at Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit may end the employment
relationship at will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance
notice.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_20_0.png)

The introductory period for all new and rehired team members is the first 90 calendar days after the date of
hire. If there is a significant period of absence during the introductory period, the period will automatically
be extended by the length of the absence. Either during the introductory period, or at the end of the period,
we may extend the introductory period if we determine there was not adequate time to evaluate performance.

When the introductory period is satisfactorily completed, team members enter the "regular" employment
classification.

During the introduction period, new team members are eligible for legally required benefits, such as workers'
compensation insurance and Social Security.

After becoming regular team members, they may also be eligible for other Buchheit benefit programs,
subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Be sure to review the information for each
benefits program for the exact eligibility requirements.

###### Business Ethics and Conduct
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The successful business operation and reputation of Buchheit is built upon the principles of fair dealing and
ethical conduct of our team members. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance
of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest
standards of conduct and personal integrity.

Our continued success is dependent upon our customers' trust, and we are dedicated to preserving that trust.
Team members owe a duty to Buchheit and our customers to act in ways that will merit the continued trust
and confidence of the public.

As an organization, Buchheit will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and we expect our
directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of
all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.

In general, you should find that using good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you to act
appropriately. If you are unsure about the proper course of action, you should discuss the matter openly with
your supervisor. If necessary, you may also contact the Human Resources Department for advice and
consultation.

It is the responsibility of every Buchheit team member to comply with our policy of business ethics and
conduct.

Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary
action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

###### Team Member Relations
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 04/05/We believe that the work conditions, wages, and benefits we offer to Buchheit team members are
competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If you have concerns
about work conditions or compensations, you are strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and
directly to your supervisor.

Our experience has shown that when team members deal openly and directly with management, the work
environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that
Buchheit amply demonstrates its commitment to team members by responding effectively to team member
concerns. Because we want to maintain direct employer/team member communications, we do not believe
our team members need an outside party to speak for them and will continue to protect your right to speak
for yourself.

###### Personal Relationships in the Workplace
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The employment of relatives of individuals involved in a dating relationship in the same area of an
organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and team member morale. In addition
to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be
carried over into day-to-day working relationships. This policy applies to all team members regardless of
their gender or sexual orientation.

For purposes of this policy, a relative is defined as any person who is related to you by blood or marriage, or
whose relationship with you is similar to that of a relative. A dating relationship is defined as a relationship
that may be reasonably expected to lead to the formation of a consensual "romantic" or sexual relationship.

You may not be involved in a dating relationship with a team member who either works directly for you or
supervises you. Buchheit reserves the right to take prompt action if an actual or potential conflict of interest
arises involving relatives or individuals involved in a dating relationship who occupy positions at any level
(higher or lower) in the same line of authority that might affect the review of employment decisions.

If two people who are in a reporting situation described above subsequently develop a dating relationship,
the person in the relationship who is the supervisor is responsible and obligated to disclose the existence of
the relationship to management. We will decide which one of them is to be transferred to another available
location. If the team member is not willing to be transferred to another location, they may be terminated.

If there is a situation where a conflict, or the potential for conflict, arises because of the relationship between
team members, even if there is no line of authority or reporting involved, the team members may be
separated by reassignment or termination of employment. If in a close personal relationship with another
team member, we ask that you refrain from displays of affection or excessive personal conversation at work.

###### Conflicts of Interest
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/As a team member of Buchheit, you have the obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit
actual or potential conflicts of interest. In this policy, Buchheit is establishing the framework within which
we operate. These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further
clarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the
Company President or the Chief Executive Officer.

An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision
that may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with
Buchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or
marriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood
or marriage.

There is no "presumption of guilt" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.
However, if you have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative
that you disclose this fact to an officer of Buchheit as soon as possible. By alerting us to the existence of any
actual or even a potential conflict of interest, we can establish safeguards to protect all parties.

The potential for personal gain is not limited to situations where a team member or relative has a significant
ownership in a firm with which Buchheit does business. Personal gains can also result from situations where
a team member or relative receives a kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of a
transaction or business dealings involving Buchheit.

Company drivers are not allowed to have direct ownership in over-the-road equipment and are not
allowed to invest in a company which operates in motor carrier transportation, where the employee has
any direct or indirect involvement in the operations of such company.

###### Outside Employment
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit team members may hold outside jobs as long as they can satisfactorily perform their Buchheit job
and there is no interference with our scheduling demands.

All team members will be held to the same standards of performance and scheduling expectations, regardless
of any outside job. If we determine that outside work is impacting your performance or the ability to meet
our requirements, which may change over time, you will be asked to terminate the outside job in order to
stay employed at Buchheit.

We prohibit outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest. Further, you may not receive any
income or material gain from individuals outside Buchheit for materials produced or services rendered while
performing your job.

###### Non-Disclosure
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/It is vital to the interest and success of Buchheit that we protect our confidential business information and
trade secrets. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:

- Company correspondence
- Company emails
- Vendor information
- Customer information
- Compensation data
- Computer processes
- Computer programs and codes
- Financial information
- Marketing strategies
- Pending projects and proposals
If you are exposed to confidential information, we may request that you sign a non-disclosure agreement as a
condition of your employment.

Because we consider security breaches to be very serious; if you improperly use or disclose trade secrets,
confidential business information, or customer information, you will be subject to disciplinary action, up to
and including termination of employment and legal action, even if you do not actually benefit from the
disclosed information.

###### Access to Personnel Files
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 01/01/We maintain a personnel file on each team member that includes the job application and related hiring
documents, training records, performance documentation, salary history, and other employment records.

Personnel files are the property of Buchheit. Because this information is highly confidential, and we respect
your privacy, only persons with a legitimate business reason will be allowed access to personnel files.

Current Buchheit team members may make a written request for a copy of any item in their personnel file. If
you wish to see your personnel file, contact the Payroll Department. With reasonable advance notice and a
written request, you may review your own personnel file in our offices and in the presence of a person
authorized by Buchheit.

Team members no longer with the company can request a copy of any item in their personnel file by
submitting a written request along with a $40.00 processing and shipping fee. Items from your personnel file
will be shipped within 30 days of the request postmark.

If you disagree with any information in your file, you may submit a written statement to explain.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_24_0.png)

###### Personnel Data Changes
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/To help us keep records and benefit program information accurate, we need mailing address, telephone
numbers, your marital status, changes to your dependents' information, who to contact in case of an
emergency, educational accomplishments, and other possibly relevant information.

[The employee or independent contractor is responsible for updating their personal information via the](http://www.paycom.com/)
[current HR/Payroll system online (currently](http://www.paycom.com/)[www.workforcenow.adp.com)](http://www.paycom.com/) for any change in status,
[such as name, address, phone number, marital status, etc. Contact the Payroll or Human Resources](http://www.paycom.com/)
Department with any questions.

###### Performance Evaluations
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The best communications about job performance happen on an informal, day-to-day basis. You and your
supervisor are strongly encouraged to talk about performance regularly.

Formal written performance evaluations will be conducted at the end of the initial period of hire, known as
the introductory period. In addition, Buchheit wants to ensure that you and your supervisor have scheduled,
formal performance evaluations. These discussions give you both the opportunity to discuss job
responsibilities and goals, encourage and recognize strengths, identify and correct any weaknesses, develop
plans for dealing with any obstacles, and plan for the future.

###### Personal Appearance
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/We want Buchheit team members to reflect an appropriate business image to customers and visitors. How
you dress, your grooming, and personal cleanliness standards all contribute to that image and also to the
morale of your co-workers.

During business hours or whenever representing Buchheit, you are expected to present a clean, neat, and
tasteful appearance. You should always dress and groom yourself according to the requirements of your
position and accepted social standards. This is particularly true if your job involves dealing in person with
customers or visitors.

Your supervisor or department head is responsible for establishing a reasonable dress code appropriate to the
job you perform. If your supervisor feels your personal appearance is inappropriate, you may be asked to
leave work until you can return properly dressed or groomed.

If this happens, you will not be paid for the time away from work. Be sure to consult your supervisor if you
have questions as to what constitutes appropriate appearance. Because personal style can be important to
people, we do not want to restrict individual tastes unnecessarily.

###### Wage Administration
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 04/05/The wage administration program at Buchheit was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with
federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive
wages within our labor market. Because we believe that recruiting and retaining talented team members is
critical to our success, we are committed to paying our team members equitable wages that reflect the
requirements and responsibilities of their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly
situated team members at the same performance level in other organizations in the area.

Compensation for every position is determined by several factors including the essential duties and
responsibilities of the job, the team member's performance, and wage survey data on pay practices of other
employers. We periodically review our wage administration program and restructure it as necessary.

###### Timekeeping
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Nonexempt team members are responsible for accurately recording the hours they work. This information
also helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of "time worked" in order
to correctly calculate team members pay and benefits.

"Time worked" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties.

If you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as
well as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for
personal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours.

Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special
circumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device.

We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following
actions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with
time records, or recording another team member's time record.

If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your
scheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled
ending time.

The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from
your supervisor.

If corrections or revisions are made to the time record, both the team member and supervisor must approve
the changes on the time record as being accurate.

###### Paydays
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/All team members are paid biweekly. Each paycheck includes earnings for all work performed through the
end of the previous payroll period.

If you are going to be on vacation on a payday, your paycheck will be available upon your return.

We also offer the option of having your pay directly deposited into your bank account once you provide
[the required information (account number and bank’s routing number) to your ADP profile](http://www.paycom.com/)
[at](http://www.paycom.com/)[www.workforcenow.adp.com](http://www.paycom.com/) .

When you select direct deposit, you receive an itemized electronic statement of wages on paydays instead of
a paycheck. Direct deposit is required, unless exempt by law under your state of residence. Buchheit will not
be responsible for any delays in delivery of paychecks to locations.

###### Administrative Pay Corrections
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit takes all reasonable steps to ensure that you receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and
that you are paid on the scheduled payday.

In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay you receive, you should promptly advise the
Payroll Department so that the discrepancy can be corrected as quickly as possible.

###### Pay Deductions and Setoffs
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is legally required to make certain deductions from every team member's compensation. Among
these deductions are federal, state, and local taxes as appropriate. We are also legally required to deduct
Social Security taxes on your earnings up to a maximum amount, which is called the Social Security "wage
base". Buchheit contributes to your Social Security by matching the amount of Social Security taxes
deducted from your compensation.

Buchheit offers programs and benefits to eligible team members beyond those required by law. You may
voluntarily authorize deductions from your paycheck to cover your portion of the cost of these programs.

We may be legally required to take "pay setoffs" from your paycheck. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken
by Buchheit, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to us or to others.

If you have questions concerning why a deduction was made from your paycheck or how your paycheck is
calculated, consult with your supervisor.

###### Work Schedules
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Work schedules for team members vary throughout Buchheit. Your supervisor will advise you of your
specific work schedule. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and
ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week.

###### Break and Meal Periods
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Break periods will be allowed according to the schedule below. To the extent possible, break periods will be
in the middle of work periods. Meal periods are required according to the schedule below.

Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. During meal periods, you
will be relieved of all work responsibilities and restrictions and will not be compensated for that time.

- Team members scheduled 5 hours or less - One 15-minute break
- Team members scheduled between 5 1/2 and 6 1/2 hours - One 30-minute lunch
- Team members scheduled between 7 and 8 1/2 hours - One 15-minute break and one 30-minute lunch
- Team members scheduled 9 hours or more - One 15-minute break and one 60-minute lunch
Retail delivery drivers are required to take a 30-minute lunch each day, and OTR drivers are required a
minimum of a 30-minute rest/break period per DOT regulations which should serve as lunch.

There may be exceptions to the above lunch schedule during certain situations such as store inventories,
special promotions or special business needs, according to manager's discretion.

###### Overtime
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/There may be times when Buchheit cannot meet its operating requirements or other needs during regular
working hours. If this happens, we may give team members the opportunity to volunteer for overtime work
assignments. Overtime is considered over 40-hours in the work week, however; drivers who transport
“interstate” freight may be excepted from overtime requirements.

It is our policy that no overtime can be worked without the approval and authorization of the supervisor. We
try to distribute overtime among all team members who are qualified to perform the required work.

All nonexempt team members will be paid overtime compensation in accordance with federal and state wage
and hour restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. For this reason, time off for sick leave,
vacation, and other paid or unpaid leaves of absence is not considered hours worked for the purpose of
calculating overtime pay.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_29_0.png)

If you work overtime without receiving your supervisor's prior authorization, you may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

###### Attendance and Punctuality
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 11/01/As a team member of Buchheit, we expect you to be reliable and punctual by reporting for work on time and
as scheduled. When you are absent or late, it places a burden on other team members and can impact
productivity and service.

In the rare instances when you cannot avoid being late or are unable to work as scheduled, be sure to notify
the location manager on duty, verbally, as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
You as a team member of Buchheit are responsible to make the notification. Buchheit will in turn have the
team members’ schedules posted in the team member break room for the current week and the upcoming
week.

Because unplanned absences can be disruptive to work, a poor attendance record or excessive lateness may
lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. As stated in the Attendance Point
system below, you as a team member, may have the following points deducted from your yearly (based on a
calendar year) total of 8-points for absences that are unapproved.

The Attendance Point system is effective for all scheduled hourly team members in all retail store locations
and the Corporate Offices.

Attendance Point System Chart:

- Each Absence = **1** point (Absence is defined as arriving to work two hours past your scheduled shift oryour entire shift without a doctor’s note.)

- Each late in (tardy) or early out = **½** point (Late in is defined as 10 minutes past scheduled shift and earlyout is defined as leaving before the entire shift is completed and is unapproved by management.)

- Each Weekend Day Absence = **2** -points per day (Each weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) absences isdefined by missing your entire shift without a doctor’s note. And any absence of three scheduled days or
more without a doctor’s note.)

- Each Holiday Absence = **2-** points per day. Holidays are defined in policy *Holidays,* and also includebusiness holidays such as Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving).

- Each no call/no show for work = **4-** points (No call/no show is defined as a team member not calling orshowing up for a scheduled shift.)

If a team member reaches accumulated point according to the Disciplinary Action chart below, defined
action will take place. All accumulated points will be reviewed on a weekly basis. Disciplinary Action:

- 3 points = verbal counseling w/Personal Assistance Service Information (PAS)
- 4 points = written counseling
- 6 points = written counseling
- 7 points = written counseling including final notice
- 8 points = termination of employment

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_30_0.png)

If excessive absenteeism (e.g. call-ins, late-ins, leaving early, etc.…) does occur and three or more days are
missed within a calendar year time period your available vacation time will be used for your missed time in
addition to your point system. A doctor's excuse will be required for absences on weekends, holidays,
business holidays or any absence of three days or more to avoid receiving any points.

###### Breakroom
A breakroom is available for your use in the main building. A microwave oven, refrigerator, utensils and
condiments are available for you there. We ask that team members who use the breakroom clean up after
themselves so that it is kept clean for all to enjoy.

###### Parking
Buchheit provides our team members with assigned parking areas. Your supervisor will inform you of
which area would be most convenient for you and we ask that you park properly in these areas. Please lock
all valuables in your vehicle. Buchheit will not be responsible for any missing items from your automobile,
personal property (coat, purse, etc.) or any damage to your vehicle while on our parking lot.

###### Smoking
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/In keeping with Buchheit's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking or the use of
smokeless tobacco in the workplace is prohibited except in those locations that have been specifically
designated as smoking areas. In situations where the preferences of smokers and nonsmokers conflict, the
preferences of the nonsmokers will prevail. This policy applies equally to all team members as well as to our
customers and visitors.

###### Use of Equipment and Vehicles
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Any team member operating a company vehicle (car, truck, forklift, etc.) will be held responsible for the
cleanliness inside the vehicle. Should you receive a vehicle that is not within the required conditions; report
it immediately. All vehicles used are to be parked on company property at the end of every working day
with the exception of the over the road vehicles.

Equipment and vehicles essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to replace.
When using Buchheit property, you are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow
all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines.

Company vehicles cannot be used for personal business. All receipts for gas, maintenance, etc. should also
be turned into your immediate supervisor.

You should notify your supervisor if any equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles appear to be damaged,
defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent
deterioration of equipment and possible injury to team members or other people.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_31_0.png)

When operating a company vehicle, you are representing the Buchheit Company, therefore you should
operate them in a respectful and safe manner. Risky driving and excessive speeds should be avoided at all
times. The operator will pay any fines and/or speeding tickets in full. You must have a valid and
appropriate driver license to operate a company vehicle. Your supervisor can answer any questions about
your responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment or vehicles you use on the job.

The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment or vehicles, as well as
excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

If you use your personal vehicle, or a rental vehicle, for business purposes, you are required to have at least
the state required liability insurance coverage. You may be required to submit proof of insurance to your
location manager. If you do not have insurance, you may not use your vehicle for business purposes. Please
notify your site manager if you do not have insurance.

###### Business Travel Expenses
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit will reimburse team members for reasonable business travel expenses when the travel has been
approved in advance by the Location Manager. Once your travel plans are approved, you are responsible for
making your own travel arrangements. When approved, we will reimburse the costs of travel, meals, lodging,
and other expenses directly related to accomplishing the objective of your trip. Naturally, we expect you will
keep expenses within reasonable limits.

In the event that you are involved in an accident while traveling on business, immediately report the incident
to your supervisor. And, if you use a vehicle owned, leased or rented by Buchheit, it may not be used for
personal reasons unless you have prior approval. When a business trip is over, submit your completed travel
expense report within five days accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses. Your supervisor can
give you guidance and assistance on procedures related to travel arrangements, expense reports,
reimbursement for specific expenses, or any other business travel issues.

The following list is a guideline for expense reimbursements:

- If using a personal vehicle, Buchheit will reimburse you for mileage for business-related travel. If using acompany vehicle, Buchheit will reimburse gas expense only (receipts required).

- Any personal long-distance calls made from work must be made on your calling card or made collect.
- Buchheit will reimburse for any supplies purchased on behalf of the company. The reason for thepurchase must be on the reimbursement form, as well as manager's approval.

We consider abuse of this policy to be a very serious matter. This includes falsifying expense reports to
reflect costs that were not incurred by you or were not business-related. Therefore, failure to follow this
business travel expense policy may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment. Expense reimbursement may be withheld if proof of automobile insurance has not been
submitted to the Loss Prevention Department.

###### Visitors in The Workplace
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/09/To better protect the safety and security of team members, as well as Buchheit property and facilities, only
authorized visitors are allowed in the corporate offices, distribution center, and office areas of our retail
locations. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps to maintain safety standards, safeguard team member and
customer welfare, protect equipment and confidential information against theft, and reduce potential
distractions and disturbances.

All visitors/vendors should enter Buchheit Corporate Office at the main entrance and should sign the

explosives, or other improper materials. We prohibit the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials
on our premises. To ensure this policy is successful, we need every team member's cooperation.

We may provide you with desks, lockers, and other storage devices for your convenience, but these are
always the sole property of Buchheit. Because they are our property, we may inspect them along with any
items that are inside them. Agents or persons we authorize, either with or without prior notice to you, may
make an inspection at any time. We also want to discourage theft and the unauthorized possession of
property that belongs to our team members, Buchheit visitors, and customers. To help enforce this policy, we

packages or other belongings they carry with them.

###### Solicitation/Bulletin Boards

Buchheit team members from either soliciting or distributing literature in the workplace at any time for any
purpose.

We recognize that our team members are often active and have interest in events and organizations outside
work. However, it is also our policy that team members may not solicit for or distribute literature about these
activities during working time. (Working time excludes lunch periods, work breaks, or any other time when
a team member is not "on duty" or scheduled to be working.)

Posting notices and solicitations on our bulletin boards is also limited to only certain types of information.
Buchheit uses these bulletin boards to display information we think is important to team members. We
suggest that you check them frequently to see important information.

If you have a message of interest to the workplace that you want to post, you may submit it to the location
manager for approval. Approved messages will be posted by the location manager.

###### Collections of Money
The company does not allow an employee to initiate collections of money on company property for non-
business purposes.

###### Recycling
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit supports environmental awareness by encouraging recycling and waste management in our
business practices and operating procedures. This support includes a commitment to the purchase, use, and
disposal of products and materials in a manner that will best utilize natural resources and minimize negative
impacts on the earth's environment.

We have special recycling receptacles set up at Buchheit to promote the separation and collection of the
following recyclable materials:

- Computer paper
- Corrugated cardboard
- Aluminum
- Plastics
- Printer cartridges
The simple act of placing a piece of paper, can, or bottle in a recycling container is the first step in reducing
demand on the earth's limited resources. Success of this program depends on active participation by all of us.

We encourage you to make a commitment to recycle and be a part of this solution.

A suggestion is an idea that will benefit Buchheit by solving a problem, reducing costs, improving
operations or procedures, enhancing customer service, eliminating waste or spoilage, or making Buchheit a
better or safer place to work.

Statements of problems without accompanying solutions, or recommendations concerning co-workers and
management are not appropriate suggestions.

###### Workplace Etiquette
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit strives to maintain a positive work environment where team members treat each other with respect
and courtesy. Sometimes, issues can arise when team members may be unaware that their behavior at work
may be disruptive or annoying to others.

Very often you can address these day-to-day issues by politely talking with your co-worker to bring the
perceived problem to his or her attention.

In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate resolution. Buchheit encourages all team members
to keep an open mind and graciously accept constructive feedback or another team member's request for you
to change your behavior because it may be affecting that person's ability to concentrate and be productive.

The following are some workplace etiquette guidelines and suggestions to help you be more conscientious
and considerate of your co-workers and the work environment. These are not necessarily intended to be hard
and fast work rules with disciplinary consequences.

- Avoid public accusations or criticisms of other team members.
- Address issues privately with those involved or your supervisor.
- Try to minimize unscheduled interruptions of other team members while they are working.
- Communicate by email or phone whenever possible, instead of walking unexpectedly into someone'soffice or workspace.

publicly or doubts of any kind, speak with a Buchheit manager before releasing any information that
could be potentially harmful to Buchheit, our products, team members, and customers.

###### Workplace Monitoring
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit may conduct workplace monitoring to help ensure quality control, team member safety, security,
and customer satisfaction.

Team members who regularly communicate with customers may have their telephone conversations
monitored or recorded. We use telephone monitoring to identify and correct performance problems with
targeted training. We are always striving for improved performance to enhance our customers' image of
Buchheit as well as customer service satisfaction.

The computer equipment and systems and Internet access that team members may use are always the
property of Buchheit. Therefore, we reserve the right to monitor computer activities. We also reserve the
right to retrieve and read any computer files or data that are composed, sent, or received through Internet
connections or stored in our computer systems.

We may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. We use video monitoring to identify
safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage and prevent acts of
harassment and workplace violence.

You may request access to information gathered through workplace monitoring that may impact employment
decisions. We will grant access unless there is an ongoing investigation or a legitimate business reason to
protect confidentiality.

Because we are sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of or our team members, we will make every effort
to guarantee that workplace monitoring is always done in an ethical and respectful manner.

###### Use of Phone and Mail Systems
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit telephones are intended for business use, and team members are not permitted to make personal
long-distance or toll calls from our phones. We request that you keep any personal local calls to a minimum
and may require you to reimburse Buchheit for charges resulting from personal calls.

It is not acceptable to use Buchheit postage or metering for your personal mail. The postage is intended only
for official business-related mail.

Because our telephone communications are an important reflection of our image to customers and the
community, every team member should use proper telephone etiquette.

Some examples of good telephone etiquette are: always using the approved greeting, speaking courteously
and professionally, confirming the information you have received from the caller, and only hanging up once
the caller has done so.

###### Cell Phone Usage
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 1/05/Buchheit provides cellular telephones to some team members as business tools. The phones are provided to
assist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other
business-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,
brief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit
issued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality.

Company provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the
team member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for
replacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being
eligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility
window, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also
responsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services.

Buchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list
accessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded
applications to company provided cell phones.

While driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that
reason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You
should utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or
talk on the phone.

If you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your
conversations private and non-disruptive to others.

The use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited.

###### Personal Identifiable Information Policy (PII)
It is company policy to protect personally identifiable information (PII) of employees and contractors.
The electronic restrictions and safeguards outlined in this policy provide guidance for employees, and
contractors that have access to PII to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations.

**Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as:** Any representation of information that permits
the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or
indirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual (e.g.,
name, address, social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email
address, etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other
data elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender,
race, birth date, geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the
physical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable information.
This information can be maintained in either paper, electronic or other media.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_41_0.png)

Some information that is considered PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, public
websites, university listings, etc. This type of information is considered to be **Public PII** and includes:

1. First and Last name
2. Address
3. Work telephone number
4. Work e-mail address
5. Home telephone number
6. General educational credentials
7. Photos and video
In contrast, **Protected PII** is defined as any one or more of types of information including, but not
limited to:

1. Social security number
2. Username and password
3. Passport number
4. Credit card number
5. Clearances
6. Banking information
7. Biometrics
8. Data and place of birth
9. Mother’s maiden name
10. Criminal, medical and financial records
11. Educational transcripts
12. Photos and video including any of the above
Employees are reminded that safeguarding sensitive information is a critical responsibility that must be
taken seriously at all times. Company policy specifies the following security policies for the protection
of PII and other sensitive data:

- It is the responsibility of the individual user to protect data to which they have access.

- Employees having access to personal information shall respect the confidentiality of such
information, and refrain from any conduct that would indicate a careless or negligent attitude
toward such information. Employees also shall avoid office gossip and should not permit any
unauthorized viewing of records. Only individuals who have a "need to know" in their official
capacity shall have access to such records.

The loss of PII can result in substantial harm to individuals, including identity theft or other fraudulent
use of the information. Because employees may have access to personal identifiable information
concerning individuals and other sensitive data, we have a special responsibility to protect that
information from loss and misuse. With these responsibilities employees should:

- Safeguard information to which the employee has access at all times.

- Obtain management's **written** approval prior to taking any sensitive information away from the
office. The manager's approval must identify the business necessity for removing such
information from the facility.

- When approval is granted to take sensitive information away from the office, the employee must
adhere to the security policies described above.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_42_0.png)

Information System – a collection of computing resources that are accessible through privileged access
such as a login or key. Usually a software package designed to store employee data.

Secure Deletion – Secure deletion of an electronic file is accomplished by overwriting the full file
contents with random data multiple times.

All electronic files that contain Protected PII shall reside within a protected Information System. All
physical files that contain Protected PII will reside within a locked file cabinet or room when not being
actively viewed or modified. Protected PII is not to be downloaded to personal or employee workstations
or mobile devices (such as laptops, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, tablets or removable
media) or to systems outside the protection of the company. PII will also not be sent through any form of
insecure electronic communication such as E-mail or instant messaging systems.

Significant security risks emerge when PII is transferred from a secure location to a less secure location
or is disposed of improperly. When disposing of PII the physical or electronic file should be shredded or
securely deleted.

Employees should ensure they are aware of their responsibilities regarding the protection of PII. In
addition to the forgoing, if employees become aware of a theft or loss of PII, they are required to
**immediately** inform management.

Any employee found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action as deemed
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances giving rise to the violation.

###### Team Member Conduct and Work Rules
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, we expect you to follow rules
of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and Buchheit.

Although it is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable at work, the
following are some examples of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment:

- Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property
- Falsification of timekeeping records
- Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs
- Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty,or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment

- Fighting, threatening violence, or bullying in the workplace
- Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace
- Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property
- Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct
- Violation of safety or health rules
- Smoking in prohibited areas

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_43_0.png)

- Sexual or other unlawful of unwelcome harassment
- Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace
- Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice
- Unauthorized absence from work area during the workday
- Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment
- Unauthorized disclosure of business "secrets" or confidential information
- Violation of personnel policies
- Unsatisfactory performance or conduct
Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to
terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause or advance notice, at any time.

###### Problem Solving Process
We encourage team members to work out any problems they have with their peers and their immediate
supervisors on a one-to-one basis. If you believe your problem is not adequately addressed, you may take the
problem to any supervisor/manager in your line of authority.

If you are unable to work out problems informally, you may briefly describe the problem in writing and
submit it to the corporate loss prevention department. Appropriate personnel will be assigned to look into
the problem and attempt to resolve it completely. Management will respond to the problem by the team
member’s next workday (Mon.-Fri.). If you are not satisfied with the resolution, you may discuss the
problem with senior corporate management.

You must call the attention of management to the problem within 30 calendar days of its occurrence. If you
believe you are experiencing sexual harassment, you may raise this problem in the same manner as for any
other problem, except that you have 180 calendar days.

When attempting to resolve a problem in person, two company representatives or members of management
must be present.

###### Open Door Policy
Any applicant or employee who believes that there has been a violation of company policy or any applicable
law relating to accommodating a person with a disability should immediately contact the Human Resource
Department. All complaints are promptly investigated. All individuals are expected to cooperate with an
investigation. The information in the course of an investigation is held in confidence and is only disclosed to
individuals who have a need to know.

###### Progressive Discipline
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This policy describes the policy for administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory
conduct at Buchheit. We believe that the best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to be
enforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all employment levels.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_44_0.png)

We also believe that it is in the best interests of Buchheit to ensure fair treatment of all team members and
make certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any
disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the team member for
satisfactory performance in the future.

Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to
terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive
discipline at its discretion.

Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or
without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of
occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.

Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be
followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;
another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of
employment.

Buchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify
either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual
progressive discipline steps.

While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee
Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or
termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be
examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline.

By using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early
stage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit.

###### Problem Resolution
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for our team members. Part of this
commitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or
question receives a timely response from Buchheit supervisors and management.

Buchheit strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members. We expect supervisors, managers,
and team members to treat each other with mutual respect. We encourage team members to offer positive
and constructive criticism to each other.

If you disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, you can express your concern
through the problem resolution procedure. You will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a
complaint with Buchheit in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution
procedure.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_45_0.png)

If a situation occurs when you believe that a condition of employment or a decision affecting you is unjust or
inequitable, you are encouraged to make use of the following steps. You may discontinue the procedure at
any step.

1. You present the problem to your supervisor within 30 calendar days after the incident occurs. If yoursupervisor is unavailable or you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, you may present
the problem to the Loss Prevention Manager or any other member of management.

1. The supervisor responds to the problem during discussion or within 30 calendar days after consultingwith appropriate management, when necessary. The supervisor documents the discussion.

1. You present the problem to the Loss Prevention Manager within 30 calendar days if the problem isunresolved.

1. The Loss Prevention Manager counsels and advises you, assists you in putting the problem in writing,visits with your supervisor/managers, if necessary, and directs you to the Director of Stores for a review
of the problem.

1. You present the problem to the Director of Stores in writing.
2. The Director of Stores reviews and considers the problem. The Director of Stores informs you of thedecision within 30 calendar days and forwards a copy of the written response to the Loss Prevention
Manager for your file. The Director of Stores has full authority to make any adjustment deemed
appropriate to resolve the problem.

Not every problem can be resolved to everyone's total satisfaction, but only through understanding and
discussion of mutual problems can team members and management develop confidence in each other. This
confidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment and helps to
ensure everyone's job security.

###### Safety
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This program is a top priority at Buchheit. To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for
team members, customers, and visitors, Buchheit has established a workplace safety program. The Loss
Prevention Department is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety
program. The success of the program depends on the alertness and personal commitment of everyone.

We provide information to team members about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal
communication channels. These may include supervisor-team member meetings, bulletin board postings,
memos, or other written communications.

Team members and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential
safety and health hazards, as well as safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards.
We also have a safety advisory group that assists in these activities and helps facilitate effective
communication between team members and management about workplace safety and health issues.

If you have an idea, concern, or suggestion for how to improve safety in the workplace, we encourage you to
tell your supervisor, location manager, Safety Manager, or the Loss Prevention Manager. We want you to be
assured that you can report any concerns about workplace safety anonymously if you wish, and you can make
a report without fear of reprisal.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_46_0.png)

You are expected to obey all safety rules and use caution in your work activities. You must immediately
report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. If you violate Buchheit safety standards, cause a
hazardous or dangerous situation, or fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, you may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

In the case of an accident that results in an injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, you
should immediately notify the Loss Prevention Department or the appropriate supervisor. Prompt reporting
can ensure legal compliance and quick initiation of insurance and worker's compensation benefits
procedures. A post-accident drug and alcohol screen will be required.

###### Workplace Violence Prevention
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. We
have adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual)
violence that might occur during business hours or on our premises.

All team members, including supervisors and temporary team members, should be treated with courtesy and
respect at all times. Team members are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay", or other conduct that
may be dangerous to others. We prohibit firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices and
substances from the premises of Buchheit without proper authorization.

Buchheit will not tolerate conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer,
or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods. This includes all acts of harassment,
including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, national origin, disability, religion, or
any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

All threats of (or actual) violence, either direct or indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your
supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by team members as well as threats by
customers, vendors, solicitors, or anyone else. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific
and detailed as possible.

Be sure to report any suspicious person or activities as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place
yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work area, do not try to intercede
or see what is happening.

We will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats (or actual), bullying or violence and of
suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the person who made the report will be protected to the
extent practical. To maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Buchheit may suspend a
team member, either with or without pay, pending investigation.

Any person who violates these guidelines will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment. Violations include making a threat of violence or actually committing a violent
act.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_47_0.png)

If you are having a dispute or differences with another team member, we encourage you to discuss it with
your supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager before the situation escalates into potential violence.
Buchheit is eager to assist in the resolution of team member disputes, and we will not discipline a team
member for raising these types of concerns.

###### Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of harassment and
discrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual
harassment. This policy applies to all employees of the company, including supervisors and non-supervisory
employees, and independent contractors.

In keeping with this commitment, the company maintains a strict policy prohibiting harassment or
discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental and/or physical
disability, national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law. This includes any form of verbal,
non-verbal, physical, and visual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an
individual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other
legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. We provide ongoing sexual harassment training to
ensure you the opportunity to work in an environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment.

Moreover, it is the policy of the company to prevent and prohibit misconduct on the job, including
sexual harassment or any other type of harassment or discrimination by co-workers, other employees,
including supervisors, and persons doing business with or for the company.

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other offensive conduct of a sexual nature do not
belong in the workplace. In addition, a hostile or offensive work environment caused by remarks or actions
based on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, gender, age, marital status, veteran status, sexual
orientation, any physical or mental disability or any other classification that is protected under applicable
law, will not be condoned or permitted. Such conduct could constitute harassment, which is not only a
violation of Company policy, but also violate the law.

It is important to remember that actions or comments you may consider to be innocent or harmless may be
considered offensive physical or verbal harassment by another employee, driver, or contractor. In addition,
under some circumstances, a violation of the Company’s E-Mail, Internet, and Mobilecomm Policy may also
constitute harassment.

If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical
harassment, or there are other interpersonal issues which compromise the working environment, or which
create discord or distractions that interfere with your safety and productivity, the driver should immediately
notify his or her supervisor, or contact the Human Resources Department, so that the company may
investigate the situation. If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to
verbal or physical harassment during training, the employee should immediately contact his or her supervisor
to inform them of the situation.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_48_0.png)

All complaints will be treated as confidentially as possible and will be investigated by the Company. No
associate will suffer retaliation or intimidation as a result of the good faith, honest use of this internal
complaint procedure.

When a violation of this policy is determined to have occurred, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment/contract, will be taken. This policy is not intended to create any type
of contract between the company and any associate, and this policy is subject to review and/or modification
by the company at any time.

Harassment and/or discrimination may take many forms including but not limited to:
A) Any discriminatory or harassing action based on one’s protected characteristic (race, citizenship,
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, and/or disability) that has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or adversely effecting an
individual’s employment opportunities.
B) Such verbal, non-verbal, discriminatory, or harassing actions that create a hostile work environment.
These may include but are not limited to:
`o`
Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual advances,
invitations, or comments.
`o`
Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings, or gestures.
`o`
Physical conduct such as assault, blocking normal movement, or interference with work, when
directed at an individual.
D) Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, threats or demands to submit to sexual requests in
order to keep a job or avoid some other loss and offers of job benefits in return for sexual favors
(“Quid Pro Quo”).
E) Retaliation for having reported harassment or discrimination.

Sexual harassment may include:
A) Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual nature as a condition of an employees’ employment; or
B) Making submissions to/or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the
employee; or
C) Threatening, directly or indirectly, to retaliate against an employee, if the employee refuses to
comply with a sexually oriented request; or
D) Engaging in sexually suggestive physical contact or touching another employee in a way that is
unwelcome; or
E) Displaying, storing, discussing, or transmitting pornographic or sexually oriented materials using the
company or personal equipment or facilities while driving for the company.
F) Engaging in indecent exposure; or
G) Creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment can be physical and/or psychological in nature. An aggregation of a series of
incidents can constitute sexual harassment even if one of the incidents considered on its own would not
be harassing. Employees and independent contractors are prohibited from harassing other employees or
independent contractors whether or not the incidents of harassment occur on any company premises or
company owned/leased equipment, or customer facilities and whether or not the incidents occur during
working hours. Sexual harassment can involve males/females being harassed by members of either sex.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_49_0.png)

Although sexual harassment typically involves co-workers, it can also include third parties, such as
customers or suppliers. It is imperative that you immediately report any behavior, which you deem to be
sexually harassing so the company can take immediate action and investigate the complaint.

***Team Member Responsibilities:***
If employee or independent contractor believes that they have been subject to sexual harassment or any
unwanted sexual attention, they should:

- Make their unease and/or disapproval directly and immediately known to the harasser;
- Make a written record of the date, time, and nature of the incident (s) and the names of any witness;and

- Report the incident to their supervisor or directly to the Human Resources Department.
The company encourages drivers to communicate effectively with each other and resolve issues that
arise on the truck by themselves. However, all incidents of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual
conduct must be reported, regardless of their seriousness. Publicizing information about alleged
harassment without following the reporting procedures or filing a formal complaint might be considered
evidence of an ill intent on the part of the accuser. Complaints may be written or oral. It is important
that details be documented and reported.

***Manager and Supervisor Responsibilities:***
Supervisors must deal expeditiously and fairly with allegations of sexual harassment within their
departments whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint. Supervisors must:

- act promptly to ensure the safety of an individual who has reported sexual harassment orinappropriate sexually oriented conduct

- promptly notify the Human Resources Department of the alleged harassment or inappropriatesexually oriented conduct so that prompt investigation and any appropriate discipline can occur

- Supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate sexual harassment are in violation of this policy andsubject to discipline.

Any employee or independent contractor found to have acted in violation of the foregoing policies will
be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or
contract/lease.

***Responsibilities for Reporting Harassment or Discrimination:***
Employees or independent contractors who are subjected to/or witness harassment or discrimination
should immediately report such conduct to any one of the following members of management:

- **Supervisor**
- **Human Resources Department**
The company will take the following steps in addressing complaints of harassment or discrimination in a
confidential manner:

###### Resignation
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/Resignation is defined as a voluntary act initiated by a team member to terminate employment with
Buchheit. Although there is no requirement that you give advance notice, doing so can reduce the impact on
your co-workers and productivity. We request a resigning team member submit a written notice of
resignation at least two weeks in advance. Vacation pay may be withheld without two-weeks’ notice, subject
to state law. Vacation time may not be included as part of the two-week notice.

Before a team member leaves, we will schedule an off-site exit interview to better understand the reasons for
resignation and to go over any resulting benefit changes.

###### Employment Termination
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of
the reasons for termination are routine. These are some of the most common circumstances for employment
terminations:

- FMLA leave expires - failure to perform active work for more than twelve weeks.
- Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by a team member.
- Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization.
- Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for non-disciplinary reasons.
- Retirement - voluntary employment termination initiated by the team member meeting age, length ofservice, and any other criteria for retirement from the organization.

We will generally schedule an exit interview at the time of employment termination. The exit interview is an
opportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of any outstanding
debt to Buchheit, or return of Buchheit-owned property. It is also a time for you to voice any suggestions,
complaints, and questions you may have. Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent,
either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause
or advance notice, at any time.

Your benefits are affected by termination in several ways. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and
payable at termination will be paid out. Some benefits may be continued at your expense if you choose. You
will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations
for continuing them.

###### Termination Date
If an employee or independent contractor fails to report to work at the normally scheduled time, or a
driver abandons a truck, their termination date is the last day they worked. If an employee is on
Worker’s Compensation, short-term disability, military leave or Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and
is released to return to work and fails to report, their termination date is the date they were released to
return to work.

###### Re-Hire Policy
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/If you should terminate employment with us and then be re-hired, our policy requires that certain steps may
have to be taken before re-employment:

- Re-hires must be approved by management.
- An updated application may be required, and an updated background check may be requested.
- Pre-employment drug screen if more than 30-days have lapsed since last day worked.
- WorkSteps testing if more than 30-days have lapsed since last day worked.
- Benefits may be reinstated if termination date was less than six weeks prior to your re-employment date.
- New Hire Orientation class *may* be required.

###### Employee Benefits

Buchheit provides a wide range of benefit programs to eligible team members. Certain legally required
programs (such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance)

###### Vacation Benefits
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/Buchheit offers vacation time off with pay to eligible team members for rest, relaxation, and personal
pursuits. Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:

- Full-time team members
- Regular part-time team members
Full-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in
the following schedule:

- After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year.
- After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year.
- After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year.
Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be
eligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the
preceding two calendar years.

The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a "calendar year". A " calendar year" is defined as
the 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended
for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the
benefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information.

Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the
schedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued.

You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should
request the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will
be reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements.

Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations
are granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may
apply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence.

Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any
special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers
vacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years’ earnings.

We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the
event that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused
time.

If your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through
your last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements.

**Unpaid Time Off Policy**
Effective 12/08/All team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment. When unpaid time
off is requested for personal reasons, a team member’s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid
time off can be requested.

Unpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number
of consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than
three (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave
of absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence.

Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as
the benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit
Retirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and
employer contributions to the plan.

Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)
weeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to
properly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be
waived in emergency situations.

Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and
communicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks
prior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing
and budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar
year. If request is considered excessive more than 10 days in a calendar year the request maybe denied.
Requests may be approved or denied on the basis of these or other reasonable considerations.

Team members who are absent from work without approval of their supervisor may be subject to disciplinary
action accordance with Attendance and Punctuality Policy.

###### Holidays
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 12/16/We provide holiday time off with pay to eligible full-time team members who have completed 180 calendar
days of service as a full-time team member. If you are eligible for paid holidays, your holiday pay will be
calculated on your straight time pay rate. Holiday hours will be calculated as the following:

- Full time team members working 40 hours a week will receive 8 holiday hours
- Full time team members working 32 hours a week will receive 6.4 holiday hours
- Full time team members working 30 hours a week will receive 6 holiday hours
Also, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday
immediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday.

If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or
vacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have
applied.

If eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday
pay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday.

A holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team
members. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday.

Paid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime.
Payment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday.

Recognized holidays are:

- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
- Independence Day (July 4)
- Labor Day (first Monday in September)
- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)
- Christmas (December 25)###### Workers' Compensation Insurance
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Workers’ Compensation provides payment for medical expenses, wage loss, and disability to an
employee in the event of an injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires
medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. The injury must occur in the course and scope of employment.
Subject to the applicable legal requirements, this program provides benefits after a short waiting period
or, in the event of hospitalization.

The company is concerned about its employees. The Company and the Safety Department will work
with all employees injured on the job. Our priorities are to see that you receive proper medical attention
and return to work as soon as possible.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_57_0.png)

It is critical that you inform your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless
of how minor it might appear at the time. Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for
workers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly.
Failure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.

**You must report any injury to the Workers’ Compensation Department within 8 hours** .

No action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees’ behalf until the Safety Department has been
notified.

Drivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties
required of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and
performing pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal
vehicle to and from work.

Workers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither
Buchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for
injuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activities that we may sponsor.

The Safety Department **must** be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The
Company will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for
emergency situations). If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the
medical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the
United States.

Each Workers’ Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed
compensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired.
Your weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage. This means the weekly
benefits may be significantly less than your net pay. You should also note there is a minimum waiting
period of 3 days (depending on the state Workers’ Compensation laws) before the weekly benefits goes
into effect. This translates into a week or two without income. The calculation of your weekly benefit
and the waiting period is not a policy set by the company but rather by state laws.

Your claim may be administered, and benefits paid to you by a third-party administrator.

The Company will offer modified duty work to drivers who sustain work injuries if the treating
physician feels the driver is capable of modified duty work. Injured drivers will be offered modified
duty work that will meet their physical capabilities. Modified duty work is intended as rehabilitation and
should be temporary only.

If your claim is investigated and found to be fraudulent, benefits will be denied, and internal disciplinary
actions will be taken. If deemed appropriate, legal action may also be taken. A preventable on the job
injury may disqualify a driver from the Safety Award program.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_58_0.png)

In the event an injury results in time away from work, drivers will be responsible for making regular
contact regarding their status with their supervisor and the Safety Department. It is very critical to the
handling of a claim that the driver keeps the Safety Department informed of his/her medical status.

It is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on Worker’s
Compensation that would normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or
before the first day of the coverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the
attention of the Corporate Payroll Department. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage.

While the company cannot guarantee it will hold open an employee’s regular job during an extended
period of leave, or while an employee is performing modified duty work, the Company will consider the
physicians estimated length of absence from the employee’s regular job in determining whether the
employee will be permitted to return to work.

In accordance with the provisions of Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Workers’
Compensation time off is applied toward FMLA leave allowance, if eligible for FMLA. If not eligible
for FMLA, then a request for a Leave of Absence may be considered.

###### Time Off to Vote
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit encourages you to fulfill your civic responsibilities by voting in elections. We expect that you will
be able to vote either before or after work hours. However, if you cannot vote during your nonworking hours,
we will grant up to three hours of unpaid time off to vote.

Illinois team members will receive two hours of paid time off to vote *if* their scheduled work day starts less
than two hours after voting time begins *and* ends less than two hours before voting time ends. The team
member will be required to submit a voter's receipt.

In order to accommodate your absence, you should request the time off from your supervisor at least two
working days prior to an election day.

###### Bereavement Leave
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 0 5 / 28 /201 In the event that you need to take time off in the event of the death of a family member, Buchheit
provides bereavement leave. To request bereavement leave, see your supervisor for the proper form.
Documentation is required to be submitted with the form. We grant up to three days of paid bereavement
leave to all team members.

During paid bereavement leave, your pay will be calculated based on your pay rate at the time of
absence, excluding any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or
shift differentials. Bereavement leave will only be paid for those days that you are scheduled to work.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_59_0.png)

We will normally grant bereavement leave unless there are unusual business needs or staffing
requirements that prevent accommodating the request. You may also, with supervisory approval, use any
available paid leave benefits, such as vacation, for additional time off as necessary.

We grant up to three days of paid leave for the death of an immediate family member. The bereavement
leave policy defines "immediate family" as your spouse, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, brother,
sister, step-brother, step-sister, spouse's parent or spouse's step-parent.

We grant up to one day of paid leave for the death of an extended family member. The bereavement
leave policy defines "extended family" as your son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandchild, grandparent,
your spouse's sibling, spouse's grandparent, step-grandparent, your spouse's step-brother, spouse's step-
sister, spouse's step-grandparent, and step-grandchild.

###### Jury Duty

Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit encourages you to fulfill your civic responsibility by serving jury duty when required. Team
members who have completed a minimum of 180 calendar days of service in an eligible classification may
request up to 3 days of paid jury duty leave over any 1-year period.

If you are eligible for paid jury duty leave, you will be compensated at your base rate of pay for the number
of hours you would normally have worked that day. Salaried team members are eligible for paid jury duty
leave. If you remain on jury duty beyond the period of paid jury duty leave, you may use any available paid
time off, such as vacation time, or request an unpaid jury duty leave of absence.

If you receive a jury duty summons, show it to your supervisor as soon as possible so that arrangements can
be made to accommodate your possible absence from work. You are expected to report for work whenever
the court schedule permits.

Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during unpaid jury duty
leave and will resume when you return to active employment.

###### Witness Duty
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/We provide witness duty time off to team members who receive a subpoena to testify in court. If you are
summoned or otherwise requested to testify as a witness by Buchheit, you will receive paid time off for the
entire period of witness duty.

You will be granted unpaid time off if you are requested to appear in court as a witness by a party other than
Buchheit. However, you may use any available paid leave benefits, such as vacation, to be compensated for
that absence. In order to make arrangements for the time off, you must show the subpoena to your supervisor
as soon as you receive it. You are expected to report to work whenever you are not needed in court.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_60_0.png)

###### Military Reserve Leave
An employee who remains in the active military reserve will be allowed time off work for the required
reserve training. This time will be without company compensation but will not be in place of earned
vacation. Consequently, it will not result in loss of vacation time or vacation compensation.

The employee may use vacation time for military duty. The Company will pay the normal company
group insurance contributions during the leave of absence for military reserve training.

###### Sickness
An employee who misses work due to illness may be required to provide a doctor’s note. After an
employee has been unable to work 3 consecutive days because of a non-job-related illness or injury, the
employee may be required to present a doctor's release and/or a return to work physical to return to duty.

###### Life-Threatening Illnesses in The Workplace
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Team members with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to
continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. Buchheit supports
these endeavors as long as team members are able to meet acceptable performance standards. As in the case
of other disabilities, we will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal requirements, to
allow qualified team members with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs.

Medical information on individual team members is treated confidentially. Buchheit will take reasonable
precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure.

Supervisor/managers and other team members have a responsibility to respect and maintain the
confidentiality of team member medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

If you have a question or concern about life-threatening illnesses, we encourage you to contact the Payroll
Department or our Employee Assistance Program for information and referral to services and resources.

###### Leaves of Absence
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/There may be times when you need to be away from work for urgent personal reasons. At these times, you
may be granted unpaid (nonexempt) or paid (exempt) leave depending upon your circumstances. However,
leaves of absence will not be granted for convenience or personal benefit. These examples include starting an
outside business, building a home, harvesting crops, extending vacation, etc. After three days, consecutive or
non-consecutive requested unpaid days, in a calendar year, the team member is required to use remaining
vacation time.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_61_0.png)

Exceptions to this policy will be handled on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the Chief Financial
Officer, Loss Prevention Manager, and Location Management.

The following are some situations where you might request a leave of absence. Your supervisor must
approve the request.

- Death of a Family Member. – See Bereavement Policy
- Family Illness. If a member of your immediate family is ill and being absent from work to attend mattersrelated to the illness is necessary for you, you may be granted a leave of absence. If circumstances warrant
it, you may take a leave of up to three days. For serious health conditions of a child or a spouse, you may
request a longer leave of absence under the FMLA.

- Jury/Civic Duties. We encourage team members to fulfill their civic duties when asked to do so if thereare not urgent business reasons that would interfere.

- Medical. You may be granted a leave of absence for illness or non-elective surgery. You must usevacation days for elective surgery. You may apply for additional unpaid leave under the FMLA for non-
elective reasons. Maternity is treated like any other medical non-elective medical matter.

- Military Service. You may take an unpaid leave of absence to fulfill military obligations. You will need toprovide a copy of orders and release orders to the Payroll Department.

- Maternity Leave. Currently, maternity leave is an unpaid leave of absence for all team members, unlessyou are eligible and have enrolled in the disability program. However, you may take twelve weeks leave
under FMLA.

If you do not return to work after your leave ends, your employment will be terminated on the last day of
your leave of absence.

If you take leave that is not medical and is not covered by FMLA, you may be required to pay your health
insurance premium (100%) yourself.

Remember that you must have a letter making this request (which your supervisor/manager has approved
with their signature) on file in the Corporate Payroll Department prior to the pay period before the absence is
taken.

If you have not given the Corporate Payroll Department this information, the Corporate Payroll Department
will cancel your insurance. Payments will be due by each Friday of your pay cycle.

###### Family and Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA)
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 grants qualified employees an unpaid leave of absence for
up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period at the time of the birth/adoption of a child, or in the case of a
serious health condition affecting the employee or the employee’s spouse, child or parent.

The company recognizes that a leave of absence from active employment may be necessary for family or
medical reason. This leave of absence policy complies with the provisions of the Family and Medical Act of
1993 (FMLA).

***Family and Medical Leave Policy***

I. **Purpose:** To outline the conditions under which an employee may request time off without pay for a
limited period with job protection and no loss of accumulated service if the employee returns to work.

II. **Definition:** A family or medical leave of absence is defined as an approved absence available to eligible
employees for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year under particular circumstances that are critical to
the life of a family.

Leave may be taken:

- on the birth of an employee’s child;
- on the placement of a child for adoption or foster care with an employee;
- when an employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;or

- when an employee is unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of his or her positionbecause of the employee’s own serious health condition.

A “serious health condition” is one that requires inpatient or residential care or continuing treatment by a
health care provider. “Continuing treatment” includes two or more treatments by a health care provider
followed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider. It also
includes treatment of pregnancy or prenatal care, treatment of a chronic health condition of a serious nature,
treatment of a long-term or permanent health condition for which the family member must be under
continuing supervision of a health care provider, or any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a
health care provider either for restorative surgery or a condition, which if untreated, would result in an
incapacity of more than three days.

For the purpose of this policy, a "serious health condition" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:

- Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,hospice, or residential medical care facility; or

- A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or any otherregular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health
care provider; or

- Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care; or
- A period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma,diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); or

- Any absences to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by, or onreferral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three
consecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).

For the purpose of this policy, health care providers who may provide certification of a serious health
condition include:

to practice in the State and performing within the scope of their practice under State law

- Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social workers authorized to practice under State lawand performing within the scope of the practice as defined under State law

- Christian Science practitioners listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts
- Any health care provider recognized by the team member or the team member's group health plan'sbenefits manager

- A health care provider listed above who practices in a country other than the United States and who isauthorized to practice under the laws of that country

A team member's spouse, children (son or daughter), and parents are immediate family member for purposes
of FMLA. The term "parent" does not include a parent "in-law". The terms son or daughter do not include
individuals age 18 or over unless they are "incapable of self-care" because of a mental or physical disability
that limits one or more of the "major life activities" as those terms are defined in regulations issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

III. **Scope:** This policy applies to all family and medical leaves of absence except leaves covered under paid
employment benefit plans or polices for any part of the 12 weeks’ leave to which the employees may be
entitled under this policy. In other words, if an employee is entitled to both FMLA (Family and Medical
Leave Act) and paid leave under another benefit plan or policy, the employee must take the paid leave
first.

IV. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for leave under this policy, an employee must have been employed here for at
least 12 months and must have worked at least 1250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the
beginning of the leave. While on leave your time vested is protected, and you will not lose any benefits
accrued prior to the date the leave began (except any accrued paid leave that you are required to exhaust).

*Exception:* If an employee on leave is salaried and among the highest paid 10% of Company employees
within 75 surface miles and keeping the job open for the employee would result in substantial and serious
economic injury to the Company, the employee can be denied job restoration after leave. In this situation,
however, the employee will be given an opportunity to return to work during leave.

V. **Basic Regulations and Conditions of Leave:** Medical certification. The Company will require
medical certification to support a claim for leave for an employee’s own serious health condition or to
care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. For the employee’s own medical leave, the certification
must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform at least one of the functions of his or her
position. For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certification must include an
estimate of the amount of time that the employee is needed to provide one.

Covered employers must take the following steps to provide information to team members about FMLA:

- Post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining rights and responsibilities under FMLA
- Include information about team member rights and obligations under FMLA in team member handbooksor other written material, including Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs)

- If handbooks or other written materials do not exist, provide general written guidance about team memberrights and obligation under FMLA whenever a team member requests leave

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_64_0.png)

- Provide a written notice designating the leave as FMLA leave and detailing specific expectations andobligations of a team member who is exercising his/her FMLA entitlements. The team member may use
the "Employer Response to Employee Request for Family or Medical Leave" to meet this requirement.
This employer notice should be provided to the team member within one or two business days after
receiving the team members notice of need for leave and include the following:

`o`
That the leave will be counted against the team member's annual FMLA leave entitlement
`o`
Any requirements for the team member to furnish medical certification and the consequences of
failing to do so
`o`
The team member's right to elect to use accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave and whether the
employer will require the use of paid leave, and the conditions related to using paid leave
`o`
Any requirement of the team member to make co-premium payments for maintaining group
insurance and the arrangements for making such payments
`o`
Any requirements to present fitness-for-duty certification before being restored to his/her job
`o`
Rights to job restoration upon return from leave
`o`
Team member's potential liability for reimbursement of health insurance premiums paid by the
employer during the leave if the team member fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave
`o`
Whether the team member qualifies as a "key" team member and the circumstances under which the
team member may not be restored to his or her job following leave

Eligible team members seeking to use FMLA leave may be required to provide:

- 30-day advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable
- notice "as soon as practical" when the need to take FMLA is not foreseeable (at least verbal notice to theemployer within 1-2 business days of learning of the need to take FMLA leave)

- sufficient information for the employer to understand that the team member needs leave for FMLA-qualifying reasons (the team member need not mention FMLA when requesting leave to meet this
requirement, but may only explain why the leave is needed)

- where the employer was not made aware that a team member was absent for FMLA reasons and the teammember wants the leave counted as FMLA leave, timely notice (generally within two business days of
returning to work) that leave was taking for FMLA-qualifying reason

In addition to the information required by the FLSA, a covered employer's records must show the following:

- dates FMLA leave is taken, or hours of leave taken if FMLA leave is in increments of less than a day
- copies of FMLA notices given to and by team members
- documents describing team member benefits and leave policies
- premium payments of team member benefits, and record of any dispute over FMLA leave
The records must comply with confidentiality requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The
company may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first
and second opinions differ, the company may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider,
approved jointly by the company and the employee and paid for by the company.

*Intermittent or reduced leave.* Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule if it is
medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent. If
leave is requested on this basis, however, the company may require the employee to transfer temporarily to a
part-time schedule or an alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_65_0.png)

*Spouses combined leave.* Spouses who are both employed by the company are entitled to a total of weeks’ leave (rather than 12 weeks each) for the birth or placement in adoption or foster care of a child for
the care of a sick parent.

*Restoration to employment rights.* After a leave, an employee will be restored to the position he or she held
when the leave began, or to an equivalent position. However, if upon the expiration of the leave the
employee is unable to perform the essential function of his or her former position because of a physical or
medical condition, the employee has no right to restoration to another position. Except as to employees who
are taking an intermittent leave, as a condition of being restored to their former position, the company may
require the employee to receive certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee be
able to resume work.

VI. **Notification and Reporting Requirements:** When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth
of a child, the placement in adoption or foster care of a child, or planned medical treatment, the
employee must provide reasonable prior notice (thirty days) and make an effort to schedule leave so that
it does not unduly disrupt Company operations. Employees who are ill will be required to report
periodically on their status and their intention to return to work.

VII. **Status of Employee Benefits During Leave of Absence:** Health insurance. Group health care
coverage will continue for employees on leave as if they were still working.

It is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on leave that
would normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or before the first day of the
coverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the Corporate Payroll
Department. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage. If the leave is paid, premiums will
continue to be paid through payroll deductions.

The Corporate Payroll Department will provide a schedule of payment amounts and due dates at the
beginning of any unpaid leave of absence. (After 12 weeks of leave the team member is then responsible for
100% of the premium.)

Recovery of premiums. If an employee chooses to return to work (meaning: stay for 30 calendar days) after
an approved unpaid leave of absence, the Company may recover from the employee the cost of any payments
made to maintain the employee’s health insurance, unless the failure to return is because of a serious health
condition or reasons beyond the employee’s control.

Benefit entitlement based on length of service will be calculated as of the last paid workday before the start
of the unpaid absence.

If the employee fails to return to work at the conclusion of the leave, the Company may require the employee
to reimburse the full cost of the health care coverage during any period of unpaid leave.

VIII. **Procedures:** Employees must contact Corporate Payroll to have FMLA paperwork sent to them.
Employees must complete the employee portion of the paperwork including signature and date, and have
their physician complete the Physician portion of the paperwork including signature and date.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_66_0.png)

*Request form.* The employee must fill out a “Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence” Form in
duplicate. This form must be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate
supervisor for proper approvals, and forwarded to the Human Resources Department (see attached copy of
‘Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence’ form). If possible, the form should be submitted days before the effective date of the leave.

All requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness must include sufficient medical
certification stating:

(1) the date on which the serious health condition began;
(2) the probable duration of the condition; and
(3) the appropriate medical facts that the health care provider knows about the condition.

In addition, for leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the
amount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care.

For leave for an employee illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform at least
one of the functions of his or her position. For certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave
schedule for planned medical treatment, the certificate must state the dates on which such treatment is
expected to be given and the duration of the treatment.

A team member who expects or anticipates taking a family or medical leave is required to notify the
Corporate Payroll Department of the date of commencement and the expected duration of the leave at least
30 days in advance of the leave, or, if the need for the leave is not foreseeable, as soon as practicable. In
cases where the need for leave is foreseeable, a team member's failure to provide 30 days’ notice prior to
taking leave may result in denial or delay of leave. A team member requesting leave under this policy should
submit a complete application for leave form to the Corporate Payroll Department.

Certain "key employees" may not be eligible to be restored to the same or an equivalent position at the
conclusion of their leave. Buchheit will notify such team members of their "key employee" status and the
conditions under which job restoration may be denied, if applicable. "Key employee", as defined by law, is
typically a management position.

An eligible team member may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period
without loss of seniority or benefits. The amount of leave available to a team member at any given time will
be calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the 12-month period immediately
preceding the requested leave. A team member who fails to return to work immediately following expiration
of the authorized leave period will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. All leave taken under this
policy and leave for any other reason which would qualify under FMLA (e.g. worker's compensation leave)
will be counted against the team members leave entitlement under FMLA.

During a family or medical leave provided under this policy, team members shall first exhaust all unused
vacation before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. During a leave related to the team member's
serious health condition, the team member should also exhaust any available vacation or short-term
disability before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. Team members will not receive vacation pay in
addition to compensation from disability or worker's compensation insurance.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_67_0.png)

If a team member takes a leave of absence because of the serious health condition of the team member or the
team member's family member, the team member must submit to the Corporate Payroll Department written
medical certification from a health care provider of the serious health condition. Failure to provide such
certification upon request may result in a denial or delay of leave. Buchheit reserves the right to require that
the team member receive a second (and possibly a third) opinion from another health care provider (at
Buchheit's expense) certifying the serious health condition of the team member or the team member's family
member. Buchheit reserves the right to require that a team member provide the company with a
recertification of the medical condition for which leave is taken.

Before being able to return to work, a team member who is on leave of absence as a result of his or her own
serious health condition must submit a health care provider's written certification that the team member is
able to return to work. Failure to provide such certification may result in the delay or denial of job
restoration. During the team member's leave, Buchheit may also periodically inquire as to the team member's
intent to return to work.

Leave taken because of the team member's or family member's serious health condition may be taken on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary. If a team member seeks leave on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis, the team member must submit medical certification, as discussed
above, and additional certification from the health care provider that the intermittent or reduced schedule
leave is medically necessary.

Buchheit may require a team member taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave to transfer temporarily to
an alternative available position for which the team member is qualified or may modify the team member's
current position to better accommodate the team member's recurring periods of leave.

During the team member's family or medical leave of absence, team members have the option to stop
coverage or stop premium payments during the FMLA leave. If the team member elects to continue
coverage, Buchheit will continue to provide health insurance coverage; however, the team member will
remain personally responsible for paying the team member's portion of the insurance premium. Such
payments may be paid prior to the leave or paid during the leave. Payments must be submitted directly to the
Corporate Payroll Department. The team member must make similar payments for all other benefits in full
during the period leave. A team member who does not return may be required to repay any insurance
premiums paid by Buchheit during the leave. Team members will be eligible for COBRA benefits at the end
of their 12-week FMLA leave of absence or the last day payment was received.

Upon return from family or medical leave in accordance with this policy, the team member will be returned
to the same or equivalent position with no loss in benefits, which accrued prior to the leave of absence. A
team member who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave will be considered to have
voluntarily resigned.

If you anticipate the possibility of taking family or medical leave, or if you have any questions about the
application of this policy to your particular situation, contact the Payroll Office or Chief Financial Officer.

Additional details on The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 may be obtained by contacting the
Corporate Payroll Department.

###### Return to Work Post-Employment Testing
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 01/01/Post-employment examinations are successful tools utilized to create a more safe and secure working
environment for team members. With the advent of sports technology applied to the industrial worker,
comprehensive stress tests monitor heart and musculoskeletal function to detect disease processes, wear and
tear syndromes, and many other problems that lead to injuries and disability.

Computerized testing and stress evaluations by licensed professionals in a medical setting typically cost over
$1,000, but Buchheit is willing to pay for such services to help their team members remain safe in the
workplace and to reduce costs associated with injuries. Training provided during the examination increases
body awareness during work activities to prevent cumulative trauma and to successfully reduce injuries.
Furthermore, team member turnover and operating expenses are reduced by maintaining properly qualified
personnel in each position.

Post-employment tests may be conducted:

- as part of team member's participation in a voluntary wellness program
- to determine a team member's fitness for duty
- in response to a team member's request for reasonable accommodation
Effective June 1st, 2004, all team members employed by Buchheit will be eligible to participate in voluntary
testing once every 12 months if the team member feels that he/she is physically unable to perform their
essential job functions. Team members are not required to participate in voluntary testing and team members
who elect not to participate will not be penalized for failing to participate.

Fit-for-duty testing may be required on an as-needed basis should a team member demonstrate difficulty
performing any essential function of their position, or if there is some other reasonable basis, for belief that
an individual's ability to perform essential job functions is limited or impaired by a medical condition.
Fit-for-duty testing will be required:

- any time a team member is transferred, either permanently or temporarily, to a position which has aphysical demand level which is higher than the position that they are currently working

- any time a team member is absent from work for 3 or more days due to illness, medical procedure, orinjury. Exclusion from fit-for-duty testing if the team member misses more than 3 scheduled days due to
cold or flu symptoms provided you have a doctor’s note.

- any time a team member has been put on restricted or limited duty due to illness, medical procedure, orinjury, no matter how many days the team member was absent.

- any time a team member has been to the emergency room due to illness or injury, no matter how manydays the team member was absent

Team members must notify their location manager if they have been put on restrictive duty by their
physician. Team members who are put on restricted or limited duty due to a personal illness or injury (not
worker's compensation) may not be allowed to return to work until they have been released to full duty and
have passed the required fit-for-duty testing. Exceptions to this policy are handled on a case-by-case basis
after discussion with the Chief Financial Officer, Loss Prevention Manager, and Location Management.

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_69_0.png)

Post-employment testing may be required when a team member requests a reasonable accommodation for a
medical condition that is not known or obvious. The cost of all post-employment testing is paid by Buchheit.

Medical information collected in connection with such tests will be maintained in confidential files in
accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the information
collected will not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the ADA.

When necessary to enable an otherwise qualified applicant with a "disability" to participate in testing,
Buchheit will provide reasonable accommodations provided such accommodations do not cause an undue
hardship. Applicants who believe they need an accommodation to participate in the testing program must
request such accommodations. To minimize or avoid delays, Buchheit asks applicants to advise of the need
for any accommodation as soon as possible after receiving a conditional offer of employment.

###### Health Insurance
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The health insurance plan at Buchheit offers team members and their dependents access to medical care
insurance benefits. Full-time team members are eligible to participate in the health insurance plan. If the
team member's spouse is offered health insurance through his/her employer, he/she is not eligible for health
insurance through Buchheit. Eligible team members may participate in the health insurance plan subject to
the terms and conditions of the agreement between Buchheit and the insurance carrier.

If you change to an employment classification that would cause you to lose your health insurance plan
eligibility, you may qualify to continue your health care benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) Policy in this Handbook for
more information.

You will find details of the health insurance plan in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). When you
become eligible, you will receive an SPD and rate information prior to the enrollment date. For
questions about health insurance, contact the Human Resources Department for additional information.

Regular part-time team members are eligible to participate in the health insurance plan but will be required
to pay the current COBRA rate instead of the full-time team member rate.

###### Benefits Continuation (COBRA)
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives team members and their
qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under our health plan when a
"qualifying event" occurs that would normally result in the loss of eligibility. "Qualifying events" include
resignation, termination of employment, or death of a team member; a reduction in a team member's hours;
team member's leave of absence; team member's divorce or legal separation; and when a dependent child no
longer meets the eligibility requirements as a dependent.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_70_0.png)

Under COBRA, the team member or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at Buchheit's group rates plus
an administration fee. When you become eligible for Buchheit health insurance, we will also give you a
written notice describing the rights granted under COBRA. Because the COBRA notice contains important
information about your rights and your obligations, please read it carefully.

Dental Insurance – the insurance plan at Buchheit offers team members and their dependents access to dental
care insurance benefits.

Vision Insurance – the insurance plan at Buchheit offers team members and their dependents access to vision
care insurance benefits.

###### Life Insurance
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Life insurance offers you and your family important financial protection. Buchheit provides a basic life
insurance plan for eligible team members. You may also purchase supplemental and/or dependent life
insurance. The basic life insurance plan includes Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) insurance,
which provides benefits if a serious injury or death results from an accident.

Regular full-time team members are eligible to participate in the life insurance plan. Eligible team members
may participate in the life insurance plan subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement between
Buchheit and its insurance carrier. You will find details about the basic life insurance plan, including benefit
amounts, in the Summary Plan Description. If you have any questions, contact the Payroll Department for
more information.

###### Short-Term Disability
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit provides short-term disability (STD) benefits to eligible team members who are unable to work
because of a qualifying disability resulting from an injury or illness.

Regular full-time team members are eligible to participate in the STD plan. There is a one-time offer of this
benefit. There is no open enrollment if you should decline coverage. Eligible team members may participate
in the STD plan subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement between Buchheit and its insurance
carrier.

If the disability condition arises from pregnancy or pregnancy-related illness, it will be treated the same as
any other illness that prevents a team member from working. If the disability is covered by workers'
compensation, it is excluded from STD coverage. The STD benefits will be offset by any amounts you
receive under Social Security or workers' compensation for the same time period. You will find details about
the STD benefits plan, including benefit amounts, and schedule, limitations, restrictions, and exclusions in
the Summary Plan Description. If you have questions about STD benefits, contact the Payroll Department for
more information.

###### Long-Term Disability
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit provides long-term disability (LTD) benefits to eligible team members who have an illness or
injury that results in a long-term absence. Our LTD plan is designed to ensure a continuing income in the
event an eligible team member becomes disabled and unable to work.

Regular full-time team members are eligible to participate in the LTD plan. There is a one-time offer of this
benefit, and there is no open enrollment should you decline coverage.

Eligible team members may participate in the LTD plan subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement
between Buchheit and its insurance carrier. Once you become eligible, you may begin LTD coverage after
you have completed 90 calendar days of service. The LTD benefits will be offset by any amounts you receive
under Social Security or workers' compensation for the same time period. You will find details about the
LTD benefits plan, including benefit amounts, limitations, and restrictions in the Summary Plan Description.
If you have questions, the Payroll Department can provide more information.

###### Critical Illness Insurance
The insurance plan at Buchheit offers team members and their dependents access to critical illness care
insurance benefits.

###### Cancer Insurance
The insurance plan at Buchheit offers team members and their dependents access to cancer insurance
benefits.

###### 401(k) Savings Plan

Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit has established a 401(k) savings plan to provide team members with the potential for future
financial security for their retirement. To be eligible to join our 401(k) savings plan, you must be an active
Buchheit team member. You may join the plan at any time. Eligible team members may participate in the
401(k)-plan subject to all terms and conditions of the plan.

The 401(k) savings plan allows you to elect how much salary you want to contribute and direct the
investment of your plan account, so you can tailor your own retirement package to meet your individual
needs. Buchheit also contributes an additional matching amount to each team member's 401(k)
contribution, equal to one half of the contribution up to 2% of your gross wages, after the 1st year.

Because your contribution to a 401(k) plan is automatically deducted from your pay before federal and state
tax withholdings are calculated, you save tax dollars now by having your current taxable amount reduced.
While the amounts deducted generally will be taxed when they are finally distributed, favorable tax rules
typically apply to 401(k) distributions. Complete details are described in the Summary Plan Description
or contact Payroll for more information.

###### Employee Assistance Program
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/We care about team members' health and well-being and recognize that personal problems can sometimes
disrupt personal and work lives. While many problems can be solved on your own or with the help of family
and friends, there may be times when you need professional assistance and advice.

Through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Buchheit provides you and your immediate family
members with confidential access to professional counseling services for help in confronting such personal
problems as alcohol and other substance abuse, marital or family difficulties, financial or legal troubles, and
emotional distress.

The EAP offers problem assessment, short-term counseling, and referrals to appropriate community and
private services.

The EAP is strictly confidential and designed to safeguard the participant's privacy and rights. The
information you give an EAP counselor can be released only with your written consent, and EAP counselors
are guided by a Professional Code of Ethics.

Personal information about EAP participation is maintained in a confidential manner. No information about
your participation in the program is made known to Buchheit. EAP counselors are required by law to notify
the company if the team member, co-workers, or customers are at risk.

We offer EAP as a benefit to our team members, and there is no cost to consult with an EAP counselor. If
further counseling is necessary, the EAP counselor will outline available community and private services,
and the cost of these services will be the responsibility of the team member.

If you have concerns that are negatively affecting your life, we strongly encourage you to use the Employee
Assistance Program.

[You can reach a confidential EAP counselor by dialing 1-800-356-0845 or](http://www.paseap.com/)[www.paseap.com](http://www.paseap.com/)[.](http://www.paseap.com/)

###### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
Effective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) program that allows team members to have pre-tax
dollars deducted from their salaries to pay for eligible out-of-pocket expenses. The pre-tax contributions
made to the FSA can be used to pay for predictable non-reimbursed health care expenses during the plan
year.

Through the FSA program, you can reduce your taxable income without reducing your real income, so that
you can keep more of the money you earn.

---

![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_Logistics-Team-Member-Handbook_image_73_0.png)

Full-time team members who have completed 90 days of employment by July 1st are eligible to participate
in the Flexible Spending Account program.

Participation in the Health Care FSA is optional and determined on an annual basis for the plan year. You
must enroll for each plan year, which begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th. You determine how much to
contribute to the account, up to a specified maximum, based on anticipated expenses during the plan year.
Contributions are directed to the FSA through salary reduction on a pre-tax basis. This tax-free money is
then available to you for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Since the amounts that remain in the
account at the end of the plan year are forfeited, you should take care not to over-fund your account.

Details of the Flexible Spending Account program are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD).
Contact the Payroll Department for more information on the FSA program and to obtain enrollment and
reimbursement forms and worksheets with examples of reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses.

###### Team Member Discounts

living in the same household. Those not included in the discount program are: friends and family
members living outside the household and friends of the Team Member living in the same household.
This program is for personal family consumption, not for commercial, contracting or resale use.

We feel this is an excellent benefit offered to all Team Members, and we ask that you abide by the
guidelines. If it should be determined that you are abusing the privilege of the Buchheit Team Member
discount card, such as conducting personal "shopping" for unqualified parties with the intent of receiving
your discount, you will lose the benefit and may be subject to corrective action from the company.

Purchases must be made during off-duty hours. The merchandise must be removed from the store at the
time of the purchase. Team Members must sign an invoice for these purchases. Purchases of sodas or
snacks to be consumed while on lunch/break are to be made during the break periods, the receipt should
remain with the item.

To qualify for the everyday Buchheit Team Member Discount you must be currently employed by or
have retired status from Buchheit Inc. or any one of its affiliates, including but not limited to Buchheit
Retails Stores, Buchheit Agricultural, Buchheit Logistics, Central States Wholesale Distribution,
Carriage House Cabinets or Central States Repair.

Retired Status is defined as Team members who retire after the age of 62 and have completed 10 (ten)
years of service. These individuals will receive a Good Will Ambassador Discount Card, which will
enable them to continue to receive the Team Member Discount.

A Team Member Discount Card with the cash sales account number will be issued to you to be used
when making a cash purchase. Cards will be issued and become effective after a Team Member has
completed all pre-employment requirements and has submitted all employment information to the
Payroll Office.

The discount amount will be 10%, with the exception of farm chemicals, some power equipment, and sale
and/or clearance items, which are already discounted. Discounts do not apply to in-house accounts. Buchheit
has the right to change the discount amount and departments without notice.

Team members who retire after the age of 62 and have completed ten years of service will receive a Good
Will Ambassador Discount Card, which will enable them to receive the same discount as above.

Team member purchases of soda/snacks to be consumed while on lunch or break are to be made at the
Customer Service Desk. All other purchases must be made during off-duty hours. The merchandise must be
removed from the store at the time of the purchase. Team members must sign an invoice for these purchases.

Special Order items are those that are not normally stocked and have not been assigned a Buchheit SKU
number. Items that have a total delivered cost of $100 or more will receive an additional 15% mark-up on
the cost. Those that have a cost under $100 will receive a 25% mark-up.

***Retail Store Discount Program***
The Buchheit Retail Store Team Member Discount Program is available to all Team Members of
Buchheit, Inc., on purchases at all Buchheit Retail Store Locations & Central States Repair Shop. This
discount structure is not available at the Buchheit Agri-Center which has a separate Team Member
Discount Program. See below for details of the Buchheit Agri-Center Team Member Discount Program.

The Buchheit Retail Store Team Member Discount program is available on all in store purchases of
stocked merchandise. Over 53,000 items will receive the maximum discount of 10% off the regular
price.

The remaining items will receive a 5% discount off the regular price.

***Competitive Price Match***
We work hard to make sure our everyday prices are competitive in the market but if by chance after
applying the Team Member Discount a Team Member is able to buy an item cheaper at another retailer
we will match the net price from the other retailer. We want your business to stay here at Buchheit!

***Special Orders***
Special Order items are those items that have not been assigned a Buchheit SKU number. When a Team
Member purchases a Special-Order item the Team Member Retail on that item will be calculated as a
15% margin percentage over Delivered Landed Cost (Delivered Landed Cost is defined as the cost of the
item + Freight + Adders + any additional cost associated with the order) to the store. To calculate the
Team Member Special Order retail, take the total delivered landed cost divided by .85. (Delivered
Landed Cost / .85 = Team Member Retail). Everyday stocked items cannot be treated as special-order
items.

Items transferred from Buchheit Agri-Center to the stores under a SKU number will be discounted at the
normal Retail Store Team Member Discount Schedule. Items that are transferred from the Buchheit
Agri-Center that do not have a SKU number will be priced as a special order.

***Non-Stocked SKUs***
Items that are assigned a SKU number but not stocked in the store will be discounted the same as a
stocked item.

***Team Member Project Bid Pricing***
We want to bid your building projects such as deck projects, kitchen cabinet projects, pole building
projects, house projects, fencing projects, etc. To qualify for Team Member Project Bid Pricing, the
total value of the material list must equal or exceed $1000 (before tax) at the normal Team Member
Price Discount. Projects must be submitted to the corporate estimator to be priced.

Our corporate estimator will review the materials list and, in some cases, will discount items beyond the
[normal Team Member Discount program. Because the items involved in these projects are subject to](https://buchheits.sharepoint.com/Snapshot%20Visual%20Materials/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=Pgg9aVxQfg7wGGF6frrBz1SdW%2bivtfsrDUWMz5pj93g%3d&docid=075a3c4328f004f799808c47245c0100c)
