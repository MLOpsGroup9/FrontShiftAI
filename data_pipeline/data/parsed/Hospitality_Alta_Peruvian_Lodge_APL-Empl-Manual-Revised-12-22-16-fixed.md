###### Purpose

This handbook is directed to employees of the Alta Peruvian Lodge (hereafter referred to as
“Hotel” or “Company”). From time to time, this handbook will be revised to keep abreast of
changes. However, we cannot republish the handbook every time a change occurs. While every
effort will be made to communicate, via memo, any change to the policies and procedures
outlined in this handbook, we reserve the right to change, without written or verbal notice, all or
any part of the handbook's contents as circumstances may require.

The contents of this handbook are presented as a matter of information only and are not to create,
nor are they to be construed to constitute, a contract, expressed or implied, between the Hotel
and its properties or any of its employees.

Your employment with the Hotel is a voluntary one and is subject to termination by you or the
Hotel at will, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these
policies shall be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the
employment-at-will status of the Hotel employees.

These personnel policies are not intended to be a contract of employment.

This handbook supersedes any previous handbook, written or unwritten policies that have been
in place at the Hotel and/or its properties.

###### Organization Structure

The smooth operation of this property depends upon the coordinated efforts of the entire staff.

Interaction among and between departments and communication between managers, supervisors
and line staff are all critical elements in the day-to-day operation. With this in mind, the
following guidelines have been established:

1. The General Manager is responsible for the overall operation of the facility. He/she is
charged with the proper functioning of the property; including conduct, appearance and
job performance of all staff, as well as the proper functioning of all systems and control
procedures, setting and monitoring services standards, financial performance, purchasing,
and all human resource issues.

1. The Manager on Duty (MOD) assumes responsibility and control in the absence of the
general manager. The MOD function is to step in to any situation that may arise in the
course of business, in the absence of the GM, assisting in any department as needed.

1. Department heads are charged with the proper functioning of their particular department.
In addition, each department head is responsible for upholding the general policies and
procedures of the property. Therefore, any department head is authorized to advise and

---

correct any employee as to the general policies and procedures of the hotel, regardless of
department. Department specific procedures are the responsibility of the department head
on a day-to-day basis.

##### Benefits

###### Employee Discounts at Alta Hotel Group Properties
As an employee, you are eligible for discounts at properties owned and managed by the Alta
Hotel Group. Rooms may be available at substantially reduced rates. For information, or to set
up a reservation, contact your General Manager.

###### Vacation
Vacation time is based on an anniversary date system. Full time employees are eligible for
vacation benefits as follows:

Years of Service* Amount of Paid Vacation

(1) One Five (5) days; maximum 40 hours

(2) Two – (6) Six Ten (10) days; maximum 80 hours

(7) Seven Fifteen (15) days; maximum 120 hours

* Available to employee following their anniversary date.

Payment in lieu of vacation is not allowed.

Vacation time must be requested at least 30 days in advance and must be approved by the
employee's department head or supervisor. Vacation time is awarded on a first come-first served
basis. We will do everything we can do to grant your request, but there may be conflicts.

Employees must schedule their vacation time so as not to fall during their heaviest work
schedule, and there may be "black out" dates when vacations will not be granted.

The company does not advance vacation days to any employee. Vacation time must be used in
the year that it is earned and cannot be carried over to the following year.

###### Retirement Plan
Employees who are 21 years of age or older are eligible to participate in the Alta Hotel Group
401k plan, after one year of uninterrupted employment and if they have worked at least hours over the past 12 months. Employees can generally contribute up to 15% of their

| Years of Service* | Amount of Paid Vacation |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| (1) One | Five (5) days; maximum 40 hours |
| (2) Two – (6) Six | Ten (10) days; maximum 80 hours |
| (7) Seven | Fifteen (15) days; maximum 120 hours |

---

compensation, and the company will match 50% of the first 4% of employee contribution. Your
general manager can provide you with additional information regarding this benefit.

###### Holidays
The following are recognized holidays:

1. New Year's Day

2. Memorial Day

3. Independence Day

4. Labor Day

5. Thanksgiving Day

6. Christmas Day
Hourly employees who work on a holiday will receive pay at time and one-half their regular rate
of pay. Employees who do not work, do not receive any holiday pay. If scheduling allows,
salaried employees will receive the holiday off, with pay. To be eligible for this pay the
employee must be regularly scheduled to work on the day on which the holiday is observed and
must work his or her regularly schedule shift before and after the holiday, unless the absence is
otherwise excused by the company.

###### Jury Duty
If you are called to serve on jury duty, you will be excused from work. Please bring your
summons to your department head as soon as you receive it so that arrangements can be made
for covering your shift. At the end of your jury term, the hotel will make up the difference
between jury fees paid to you and your regular pay, for any of your regular shifts that were
missed. Documentation is required to substantiate the amount paid to you while on jury duty.

All employees are allowed unpaid time off if summoned to appear in court as a witness. You
must provide a copy of the summons to your department head.

###### Voting Time
All employees should be able to vote either before or after regularly assigned work hours.
However, when this is not possible due to work schedules, employees will receive up to two
hours during the work day to vote. Time off for voting should be reported and coded
appropriately on timekeeping records. Additionally, time off to vote must be scheduled in
advance through the employee’s department head or GM.

###### Military Leave
Employees serving in the Reserve of one of the military services are granted time off without
pay, in addition to whatever vacation time they may have earned, to attend their annual Reserve
active duty. Employees enlisting or entering the military service of the United States, pursuant to
the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, shall be granted all rights and

---

privileges provided by said act. Employees entering the military for extended service duty are
granted re-employment rights as provided by law.

###### Bereavement
In the event of a loss, needs will differ based on your relationship with the deceased. This is not
an easy time, and we want to meet your needs. Following are the general guidelines that will be
followed:

- Employees are allowed three days of paid leave in the event of the death of the
employee’s spouse, child, father, father-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, brother, sister,
stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, stepson or stepdaughter.

- Employees are allowed up to four hours of bereavement leave to attend the funeral of an
employee or retiree of the company.

Discuss the situation with your department head and leave will be granted based on your
situation.

###### Family & Medical Leave Act
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act you may be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of
unpaid leave [or up to 26 weeks of military caregiver leave to care for a covered service member
with a serious injury or illness] during a 12 month or 52 week period after completion of one
year of service. The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. Separate periods of
employment will be counted, provided that the break in service does not exceed seven years.
Separate periods of employment will be counted if the break in service exceeds seven years due
to National Guard or Reserve military service obligations. The employee must have worked at
least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months.

FMLA leave is available in the following circumstances:

- The birth of a child and in order to care for that child.
- The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for a newly placed child.
- To care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition (Under the FMLA, a
“spouse” means a husband or wife as defined under the law in the state where the
employee resides, including same-sex marriages in states that legally recognize such civil
unions).

- The serious health condition of the employee.
- Qualifying exigency leave for families of members of the National Guard or Reserves or
of a regular component of the Armed Forces when the covered military member is on
covered active duty or called to covered active duty.

Military caregiver leave (also known as covered service member leave) to care for an injured or
ill service member or veteran.

If a husband and wife both work for the company and each wishes to take leave for the birth of a
child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for a parent (but not a parent "in-
law") with a serious health condition, the husband and wife may only take a combined total of weeks of leave. If a husband and wife both work for the company and each wishes to take leave

---

to care for a covered injured or ill service member, the husband and wife may only take a
combined total of 26 weeks of leave.

###### Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule
The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently
(take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain circumstances, may use the
leave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a reduced-hour schedule. In all cases, the
leave may not exceed a total of 12 workweeks (or 26 workweeks to care for an injured or ill
service member over a 12-month period).

You may be required to provide medical certifications when requesting FMLA leave. You may
also elect to substitute, or the hotel may require that you use, any available paid leave before
using FMLA leave.

Thirty days advance notice must be given when requesting FMLA leave, except for emergency
or other unforeseeable situations. Within five business days after the employee has submitted the
appropriate certification form, the general manager will provide the employee with a written
response to the employee’s request for FMLA leave.

The company may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee’s
status and intent to return to work.

Generally, when you return to work you will be returned to the same position that you held when
your FMLA leave began or, at the hotel's option, to an equivalent position. The hotel will not be
required to reinstate you to any position if the position or shift you worked has been eliminated,
or if the specific project you were working on has been completed. An employee who takes leave
under this policy may be asked to provide a fitness for duty (FFD) clearance from the health care
provider.

###### Worker's Compensation
All employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance, which provides for payment of
medical expenses and partial wage continuation in the event of a work-related accident or illness
under the provision of the State’s Worker’s Compensation Law.

If you do have an accident or an illness, you must report it to a supervisor immediately, or as
soon as reasonably possible depending on the nature and extent of your injury. Your department
head will explain the specific procedures to follow when involved in an on-the-job injury at your
property. Note, if you go to the emergency room and the worker's compensation insurance does
not deem it an emergency, they can refuse to pay the expenses and you would be responsible for
the bill.

Employees are expected to cooperate fully with their doctor, attend all follow-up office visits,
and follow his directions completely. In order to return to work, the employee must bring a
doctor's note, indicating their ability to do the job, and/or indicating work restrictions. The
Company recognizes the importance of returning an employee to work as soon as possible
following an injury, therefore, accommodations will be made to meet any work restrictions

---

outlined by the doctor. The employee will be expected to return to work when appropriate
restrictions and accommodations are made. Failure to return to work may result in forfeiting
worker's compensation payments.

If you are involved in an on-the-job accident, you will need to complete an Accident Report
Form as soon as reasonably possible depending on the nature and extent of your injury.
Your department head will give you the form and assist you with filling it out, as needed.

Under no circumstances will a wage be increased or compensation be paid in lieu of a benefit.

###### PAY PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES

###### Pay Periods and Pay Dates
Pay periods run from the first of the month, through the 15th, and the 16th through the end of the
month. Pay checks will be issued on the 7th and the 22nd of each month if the payday falls on a
weekend or holiday, checks will be issued on the day before. Direct deposit is available…please
see the property accountant or your GM to arrange.

Paychecks can be picked up in your department, after 10:00 a.m. on payday. Any questions
concerning your paycheck should be discussed immediately with your department head.

For your protection, you are the only person who will be allowed to pick up your paycheck. In
the event that you do need to have a family member or friend pick up your check, it must be
arranged in advance with your department head.

Pay advances will not be allowed at any time no exceptions. Paychecks will not be cashed by
the facility.

###### Time Clock
All hourly employees are required to clock in and out at the beginning and end of their shift.

- Employees should not punch in earlier than seven (7) minutes prior to the beginning of
their scheduled shift, nor later than seven (7) minutes following the end of their
scheduled shift.

- Failure to punch in and/or out for a shift may result in your not being paid for that time
worked.

Once the missed punch is brought to the attention of the Payroll Department, the hours will be
paid retroactively on your next paycheck. However, a special check will not be cut in the interim
to make up wages due to missed punches.

- Your time card is the property of the facility. If it is misplaced or destroyed, it will cost
you $5.00 for a replacement card.

- Clocking in/out fraudulently is grounds for termination. This includes having someone
else clocking in for you, or misrepresenting time worked in the case of a missed punch.

---

###### Schedules
For purposes of scheduling and pay, the work week begins on Sunday. Your department head
will show you the location of your department bulletin board and the place where work
schedules are posted.

Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the work schedule and to report ready to
work, on time.

Changes to the schedule may be necessary from time to time. Although an employee is not
required to come in on their day off, your cooperation is appreciated. Working as a team means
that you will cover for a sick employee, knowing that perhaps the situation will be reversed in
the future and that employee will cover for you.

If personal circumstances require it, you may request a schedule change. It is your responsibility
to arrange a fill-in for the shift(s) you will miss. The replacement must be from the same
department and requires at least 24-hour advance notice to your department head. Management
has the right to refuse such a change if it causes the replacement to qualify for overtime or
otherwise creates a hardship to the replacement or the department operation. This provision
does not apply to Bereavement leave, Jury Duty, the Family & Medical Leave Act, or scheduled
Military Leave.

Remember: It is your responsibility to know and follow your schedule.

###### Overtime
Schedules are determined by the GM or department heads on a weekly basis and employees
should clock in and out according to that schedule. All overtime is to be approved by the
department head or GM prior to the employee working beyond their scheduled time. Overtime
will be paid at the rate of time and a half for hours exceeding 40 between Sunday at 12:01 a.m.
and Saturday at 12:00 midnight.

Overtime hours will be paid for only once. In no case will there be any pyramiding of overtime
hours. Vacation time will not be considered as time worked for overtime purposes.

###### Absenteeism/Tardiness
The successful operation of the Hotel depends upon every team member being at work and on
time. Employees must notify their department head of an intended absence as soon as is known,
but in any event at least four hours before their scheduled starting time. This procedure must be
followed for each day of absence. Failure to notify management of an expected absence may be
considered a no-call, no-show situation and will result in a warning notice and counseling on
attendance for the employee. If an employee doesn't show up for three shifts in a row, without
notification to management of any kind, it will be determined that they have quit their job. In
addition, failure to report to work for three days (consecutive or otherwise) during any three
consecutive months, without authorization, may result in discharge without prior warning.

---

If an employee misses three or more consecutive days because of illness, a written notification
from a physician describing the reason for the illness and absence may be required. This
notification must be submitted before the employee is allowed to return to work to ensure the
employee's health is adequate to perform work duties.

If an employee is going to be late for a shift, it is their responsibility to call his/her department
head or supervisor as soon as is known, but in any event at least two hours before the scheduled
starting time. The employee must specify the time he/she may be expected to arrive for work. In
such event, the manager may decide to cancel the employee's shift, at his/her discretion.

If you are unable to speak directly to your department head to report that you will be late or sick,
you must leave a message. Within two hours after your start time, you must call back and speak
with your department head or GM

###### Breaks
A fifteen-minute rest break will be allowed during each four hours of a regularly scheduled work
shift, at a time and place authorized by your department head. Employees on their break are
required to remain on the premises and to perform such duties as may be necessary from time to
time.

A thirty-minute lunch break will be allowed during each eight-hour shift, taking place
approximately after half the shift has been completed. Employees are required to punch out for
their half-hour break.

###### Employee Travel and Reimbursement
Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with approved
travel on behalf of the company.

Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses and
exercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety. If a circumstance arises that is not
specifically covered in the travel policies, the most conservative course of action should be
adopted.

Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned travel is
eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Upon completion of the trip, and
within 30 days, the traveler must submit a Travel Reimbursement Form and supporting
documentation to obtain reimbursement of expenses.

Exempt employees will be paid their regular salary for weeks in which they travel. Nonexempt
employees will be paid for travel time in accordance with federal and state wage payment laws.

###### WORKPLACE EXPECTATIONS

###### Confidentiality
Company employees may receive or have access to confidential and/or proprietary information
that belongs to, is in the possession of, or was obtained from the Company or its guests,

other financial information, budgets, business plans, bids, business opportunities, computer
software, computer system passwords and security codes, operational information, and other
confidential and/or proprietary information. Employees are prohibited from disclosing to any
person or entity, or using in any manner whatsoever, other than on behalf of the Company and in

individual employees or are otherwise not provided by the Company. An employee shall lock
his or her computer, tablet, laptop, and hand-held devices so that they can only be accessed by

The employee must immediately report to the GM or Company President any loss or theft of any
document, computer, laptop, cellular phone or other device that contains the Company’s
confidential information or that has access to the Company’s server or network. It is vital that
the Company receive reports of loss or theft immediately after the employee becomes aware of
such loss or theft so that the Company can take appropriate steps to protect its confidential
information.

At the request of the Company, or upon the termination of their employment, employees are
required to turn over to the Company all documents, papers, materials, electronic copies, and/or
digital data in their possession or under their control which may contain or be derived from
confidential and/or proprietary information of the Company, including copies thereof.

Any request for information or any questions about whether information may be discussed with
anyone outside the Company should be directed to the General Manager or the Company’s

---

President. Violation of any aspect of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.

###### Conflicts of Interest
Employees must avoid any relationship or activities that interfere with their ability to perform
their job duties.

This includes situations where such an activity might impair, or even appear to impair, their
ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing their jobs. Employees with a
conflict-of-interest question should seek advice from management. Before engaging in any
activity, transaction or relationship that might give rise to a conflict of interest, employees must
seek review and consent from their general manager.

###### Electronic Communication and Internet Use
The following guidelines have been established for using the Internet, company-provided cell
phones and e-mail in an appropriate, ethical and professional manner:

- Internet, company-provided equipment (e.g., cell phone, laptops, computers) and services
may not be used for transmitting, retrieving or storing any communications of a
defamatory, discriminatory, harassing or pornographic nature.

- The following actions are forbidden: using disparaging, abusive, profane or offensive
language; creating, viewing or displaying materials that might adversely or negatively
reflect upon the Hotel or be contrary to the Hotel’s best interests; and engaging in any
illegal activities, including piracy, hacking, extortion, blackmail, copyright infringement,
and unauthorized access of any computers and company-provided equipment such as cell
phones and laptops.

- Employees may not copy, retrieve, modify or forward copyrighted materials, except with
permission or as a single copy to reference only.

- Employees must not use the system in a way that disrupts its use by others. Employees
must not send or receive large files that could be saved/transferred via thumb drives.

- Employees should not open suspicious e-mails, pop-ups or downloads.
- Internal and external e-mails are considered business records and may be subject to
discovery in the event of litigation. Be aware of this possibility when sending e-mail
within and outside the company.

- The Company permits employees to use its Communications Systems for personal
purposes as long as the employee’s personal use does not interfere with the employee’s
job responsibilities and otherwise complies with the Company’s Internet, Electronic and
Communications Systems Policy, the Social Networking Policy, and other applicable
policies in this manual or issued by the Company from time to time.

###### Right to Monitor
All company-supplied technology and company-related work records belong to the company and
not to the employee. Alta Hotel Group routinely monitors use of company-supplied technology.
Inappropriate or illegal use or communications may be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment.

---

###### Social Media—Acceptable Use
Below are guidelines for social media use.

Employees may not post financial, confidential, sensitive or proprietary information about the
Hotel, vendors, employees, guests or applicants.

Employees may not post obscenities, slurs or personal attacks that can damage the reputation of
the company, clients, employees, guests or applicants.

When posting on social media sites, employees must use the following disclaimer when
discussing job-related matters, “The opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not
necessarily represent the views of the Alta Peruvian Lodge.”

The Hotel may monitor content out on the Internet. Policy violations may result in discipline up
to and including termination of employment.

###### Solicitations
The solicitation, distribution and posting of materials on or at company property by any
employee or nonemployee is not permitted without the prior approval of the GM.

###### APPEARANCE, DRESS and GROOMING STANDARDS

It is important for all employees to project a professional image while at work by being
appropriately attired. Hotel employees are expected to be neat, clean and well groomed while on
the job. Clothing must be appropriate to the type of work being performed.

Uniforms will be provided to those employees who are required to wear a uniform in the course
of their duties. Employees in positions that require a uniform are expected to be in proper
uniform anytime they are working. It is the employee’s responsibility to keep the uniform in
good repair and to prevent its loss or destruction beyond ordinary wear and tear. Uniforms must
be clean and well pressed at all times. If a uniform is lost, stolen, destroyed, or rendered
unusable, the employee will be charged the full cost for its replacement. Uniforms are not to be
worn off duty at any time, with the exception of traveling directly to and from work. If you are
permitted on the premises during non-working hours, uniforms may not be worn.

All employees are required to wear a name badge, which will be provided by the Company. The
badge is to be considered a part of the employee’s uniform. Any other badges, pins, buttons, or
decorations may only be worn with the approval of the General Manager. If an employee’s
name badge is lost, a replacement will be provided at the employee’s expense. An employee’s
name badge must be returned to the Company upon termination of employment.

Natural and artificial scents may become a distraction from a well-functioning workplace and are
also subject to this policy

The Hotel is confident that employees will use their best judgment regarding attire and
appearance. Management reserves the right to determine appropriateness. Any employee who is

---

improperly dressed will be counseled or in severe cases may be sent home to change clothes.
Continued disregard of this policy may be cause for disciplinary action, which may result in
termination.

###### SAFETY and SECURITY

###### Safety Standards
Accident prevention is one of the most vital concerns, in fact, safety is a prerequisite to
continued employment. It is the intent of management to afford you a safe and productive place
in which to work. Toward this end, all employees are expected to be familiar with and to follow
basic rules of safety.

Accidents are usually caused by carelessness or neglect on the part of individuals. Fatigue and a
rush to complete any given task also contribute to accidents. Be aware of any tendencies in
these regards and remember that safety is the priority. We also advise every employee to take
note of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of
your training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct
any unsafe condition or practice. You are to report to your supervisor immediately any situation
which appears unsafe to you and that you cannot correct yourself.

"Safety consciousness" are key words each of us must remember at all times. Employees with
poor safety records are a hazard to all of us, and are subject to dismissal. While most safety
precautions are simply a matter of common sense and good housekeeping, we have developed a
safety notebook which is available in your department. It is your responsibility to read the
notebook and become familiar with proper safety procedures.

###### Use of Equipment
Employees are not to work with any equipment or machinery which they have not been properly
trained on.

###### Material Safety Data Sheets (M.S.D.S.)
For your protection, M.S.D.S. sheets are available for your review. Your department head will
show you were they are located. All employees should be familiar with the chemicals, cleaning
agents, etc., that are used in the course of their job duties. For additional information, contact
your department head or GM.

###### Company Property
Any packages or company property leaving the premises must be cleared through your
department head, supervisor or manager on duty. No employee may take or consume for

---

personal use any service, supply, tool, piece of equipment, food, beverage, etc., belonging to the
company without permission. Tools and equipment may not be loaned out without GM approval.

Personal items such as backpacks, sacks, boxes, and purses, may be subject to reasonable
inspection by management.

Any employee who willfully or negligently damages or abuses Company property or equipment
will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

###### Security
Security is vital to the property. It is everyone's responsibility to take precautions in order to
prevent theft and to ensure the safety of our guests and fellow employees. There are many ways
to make this property a safer place:

- Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable,
do not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the
person if you are uncomfortable.

If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say
something like, "Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need
help, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), "Are you a guest
here?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a
legitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better
to err on the side of caution.

- Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests.
- Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits.
- Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting
information about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General
Manager.

- Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may
offer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor.

- Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or
department.

- Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,
they should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel
employee. If no answer, they should then crack the door open slightly and repeat their
identification.

- Under no circumstances are any hotel keys to leave the property.
- Use of the guest rooms for personal use is strictly prohibited.
###### Fire Procedures
A Fire Procedures Notebook is available in your department. It contains information as to how to
respond in case of a fire. It is your responsibility to read the notebook and to become familiar
with the procedures to be followed. Every employee should know exactly where they can find
the notebook, in order to access it easily and quickly in case of emergency. It is the responsibility

---

of the general manager to conduct periodic drills to ensure staff is adequately trained to respond
in fire.

###### Drug-Free Workplace
The Hotel is committed to maintaining a safe, healthy and productive work environment for all
its employees. Abuse of alcohol, illegal drugs, or controlled substances can adversely affect the
work environment, job performance and safety of all employees and guests.

Reporting to work and/or working while impaired by, under the influence or detectable presence
of, or with unauthorized possession on company premises of alcohol, controlled substances, or
any other illegal drug is also prohibited. Violation of these prohibitions may result in
termination.

- The Hotel recognizes alcohol and chemical dependencies as treatable illnesses.
- The Hotel assures that no employee requesting treatment for a dependency will have
his/her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by this request.

- An employee having an alcohol or chemical dependency that affects job performance will
be counseled, disciplined and, if necessary, removed from their position.

###### Testing
The company retains the right to require the following tests:

- Pre-employment: Applicants may be required to pass a drug test before beginning work
or receiving an offer of employment. Refusal to submit to testing will result in
disqualification of further employment consideration.

- Reasonable suspicion: Employees are subject to testing based on observations by a
supervisor of apparent workplace use, possession or impairment.

- Post-accident: Employees may be subject to testing when they cause or contribute to
accidents that seriously damage a company vehicle, machinery, equipment or property
and/or result in an injury to themselves or another person requiring off-site medical
attention. In any of these instances, the investigation and subsequent testing must take
place within two (2) hours following the accident, if not sooner.

###### Inspections
The Hotel reserves the right to inspect all portions of its premises for drugs, alcohol or other
contraband. All employees, contract employees and visitors may be asked to cooperate in
inspections of their persons, work areas, property, and/or living quarters that might conceal a
drug, alcohol or other contraband. Employees who possess such contraband or refuse to
cooperate in such inspections are subject to appropriate discipline up to and including
termination.

###### Workplace Violence
The Hotel is committed to providing a violence-free workplace for its employees and a safe hotel
for its guests. Each employee is responsible to ensure that the premises are safe for both
employees and guests.

---

If an employee becomes aware of any actual violence, imminent violence, or threat of imminent
violence, obtaining emergency assistance must be a matter of first priority. The employee should
immediately contact local law enforcement authorities by dialing 911. Immediately after
contacting the law enforcement authorities for emergency assistance, the employee must report
the incident to the General Manager or Company President immediately. Employees may report
any incidents of violence or threats of violence without fear of reprisal or any kind.

Employees who become aware of any threats of workplace violence must report the threats
immediately to the GM or President who will consult with the appropriate resources in order to
complete an assessment of the incident and the surrounding circumstances.

In cases where it is determined that an employee has violated this policy by threatening another
individual with violence or engaging in violent behavior, management will determine the
appropriate corrective action, if any, including whether disciplinary action is warranted. If it is
determined that a threat of violence was made or actual violence has occurred, disciplinary
action will be imposed, up to and possibly including immediate termination and/or contacting
local authorities. In situations where it is found appropriate to do so, an individual who violates
this policy may be required to obtain counseling or other available assistance.

###### EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

###### Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
The Hotel provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for
employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity,
national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, amnesty or status as a covered
veteran in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The Hotel complies with
applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in
which the company has facilities. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment,
including hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence,
compensation and training.

###### Employee Definition

- Full Time. Employees who work an average of 30 hours or more per week, and at least
40 weeks per year on a regular basis are considered full time. As such, these employees
are eligible for benefits.

- Part time. These employees are hired to work less than an average of 30 hours per week,
or less than 40 weeks per year. Part time employees are not eligible for benefits.

- Temporary. There are times when an employee may be engaged to work on an irregular
or casual basis, or with the understanding that their employment will be terminated upon
completion of a specific assignment. Temporary employees may work full-time or part-
time. Temporary employees are not eligible for employee benefits.

---

- On-call. These employees work on an as-needed basis and are not regularly scheduled
from week to week. On-call employees are not eligible for benefits.

###### Background and Reference Checks
To ensure that individuals who join our Hotel are well qualified and to ensure that the Alta Hotel
maintains a safe and productive work environment, the Hotel will conduct pre-employment
background checks on applicants who accept an offer of employment. Background checks may
include verification of any information on the applicant’s resume or application form. To the
extent legally allowed at the time, the hotel may also use information available on social media
sites in its hiring decisions.

The Hotel also reserves the right to conduct a background check for current employees to
determine eligibility for promotion or reassignment in the same manner as described above.

###### Personnel Records
It is particularly important that employees keep the hotel informed about changes in their:

- Address
- Telephone number
- Marital status
- Number of dependents
- Legal name (through marriage or otherwise)
- Name of person to be notified in case of an emergency
Report any such changes, in writing, to the General Manager or the Director of Human
Resources.

Employee files are kept confidential, and may not be viewed without proper authorization from
the GM. Information in an employee file may never be used for any reason other than legitimate
hotel purposes. Violation of these policies is subject to discipline up to and including
termination. Any department head considering the hire of a former employee or transfer of a
current employee may be granted access to that employee’s file. Employees are entitled to
review their file. Although the file cannot leave the office in which it is kept, your General
Manager can make arrangements for you to review the file.

###### Introductory Period
The first 60 days of employment is an introductory period; during which time employees will be
evaluated carefully to determine their suitability for their position. An employee who fails to
perform satisfactorily during this time may be terminated without notice.

In some situations, the employee may receive a training wage during their introductory period.

###### Performance Reviews
Periodically, written performance reviews will be given by your department head. A
performance review will normally be given at least once a year and will be placed in your
personnel file. Performance reviews do not always result in a pay increase.

---

###### Discipline
Every employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by existing rules
and policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/her duties to the best of
his/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her job description or as otherwise
established.

When policies and procedures are not being followed, it is the responsibility of your department
head or the general manager to correct the situation. This will take the form of
coaching/counseling; or more formal verbal and/or written warnings.

The Hotel reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending on the facts of
each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary.
Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching,
counseling and/or training; the employee's work record; and the impact the conduct and
performance issues have on our organization.

Initially, when an employee displays unacceptable behavior or his/her performance is not
meeting the job requirements, the employee will be made aware of the situation and be given an
opportunity to correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time. In some cases, this initial
contact may include a verbal warning.

A verbal warning will occur if previous coaching has not corrected the problem or if the initial
issue is sufficiently serious. The warning will be noted in the employee's personnel records.

A written warning is given when your department head or the general manager believes that an
offense is sufficiently serious or when a verbal warning has proven insufficient. The written
warning may also include a notation indicating that the next similar transgression will result in
termination. You should recognize the grave nature of the written warning. If you feel the
warning is inaccurate or unwarranted, you may respond, in writing, and your response will be
attached to the written warning and placed in your personnel file.

An employee may be terminated if he/she has three written warnings, for any reason, in their file.

For problems deemed to be serious enough, or for failure to respond appropriately to prior
counseling and warnings, suspension and/or termination may occur. If suspended, the employee
will be expected to leave the premises immediately and remain off work, without pay, for the
duration of their suspension.

If an employee is terminated, they will be expected to leave the premises immediately. A final
paycheck will be issued the same day (or the next business day if termination happens on a
weekend). Prior to receiving their final check, the employee must tum in hotel keys, uniforms,
name badges, and any other hotel property in their possession.

Notwithstanding any of the above, an employee can also be discharged immediately if he/she
violates any of the following rules, which are such serious breaches of responsibility that no prior
warnings are warranted (the rules and regulations listed herein are not all inclusive):

---

- Theft, attempted theft, or removal from the premises without proper authorization of
company property or the property belonging to a guest or another employee.

- Possession of a lethal weapon on company premises.
- Willful damage to company property.
- Failing to report to work without authorization for three days (consecutive or otherwise)
during any three consecutive months.

- Falsification of company records including, but not limited to, employment applications,
payroll and financial reports.

- Hitting, pushing or otherwise striking another person or any other disorderly conduct
while on company premises or arising out of company business relations.

- Possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs or being under the
influence of alcohol or illegal drugs on company time or premises.

- Failure to carry out a reasonable job assignment or job request of a department head or
supervisor, after being warned that failure to do so can result in termination.

- Unauthorized entrance to a guest room.
- Conviction of a felony.
- Gross insubordination, intimidation of, harassment of or abusive language toward a guest,
co-worker or other personnel. This would include a serious guest service complaint.

- Serious misconduct which threatens the orderly functioning of the property, the safety or
security of co-workers, guests, or otherwise damaging the reputation of the business.

###### Separation of Employment
Separation of employment can occur for several different reasons.

- Resignation: Resigning employees are encouraged to provide two weeks’ notice,
preferably in writing, to facilitate a smooth transition out of the organization. If an
employee provides less notice than requested, the employer may deem the individual to
be ineligible for rehire depending on the circumstances regarding the notice given.

- Retirement: Employees who wish to retire are required to notify their department head or
General Manager.

- Job abandonment: Employees who fail to report to work or contact their supervisor for
three (3) consecutive workdays shall be considered to have abandoned the job without
notice, effective at the end of their normal shift on the third day. Employees who are
separated due to job abandonment are ineligible to receive accrued benefits and are
ineligible for rehire.

- Termination: Employees of Alta Hotel Group are employed on an at-will basis, and the
company retains the right to terminate an employee at any time.

###### Return of Company Property
The separating employee must return all company property at the time of separation, including
uniforms, cell phones, keys, PCs and identification cards. Failure to return some items may result
in deductions from the final paycheck. An employee will be required to sign the Wage Deduction
Authorization Agreement to deduct the costs of such items from the final paycheck.

---

###### Rehire
Former employees who left the Hotel in good standing and were classified as eligible for rehire
may be considered for reemployment.

An applicant or employee who is terminated for violating policy or who resigned in lieu of
termination from employment due to a policy violation will be ineligible for rehire.

###### Problem Solving Procedures
If you would like to discuss any aspect of your employment, work conditions, interactions with
other staff members, or company policy we urge you to bring your concerns to our attention.

Discuss the matter with your department head. During this discussion feel free to share your
concerns. Generally, you and your department head should be able to resolve your problems.

If no solution occurs, contact your General Manager and set a time to discuss the issue. He/she
will obtain all the facts and work to settle your problem in a fair and equitable manner. All
involved parties may be brought together to resolve the situation.

Note: Your problem may be such that you prefer to discuss it directly with your General
Manager. Always feel free to do so. All employee suggestions and complaints shall be given full
consideration. There will be no discrimination or recrimination against any employee because
he/she presents a complaint or problem.

In extraordinary situations, you may prefer to contact the president of Alta Hotel Group directly.
A “Speak Out” form is available in this manual for this purpose.

###### GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES

###### Employee Conduct
Employees are expected to treat our guests, customers, and one another with respect and
understanding.

Any rudeness (e.g., profanity, yelling, use of vulgar or obscene language, suggestive or sarcastic
gestures) will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. Do not talk about company issues in public areas and by no means discuss any
grievances with guests.

###### Dating/Marriage Policy
Dating or marriage to a coworker in today's business, legal and social environment has an impact
beyond the otherwise simple relationship between two people. Among the various factors
complicating matters, the following three "risks" are readily apparent.

Risk to the business, reflected in three main areas:

1. Financial defalcation
2. Inappropriate influence over decision making Judgment

---

1. Compromising operational policies/procedures
2. Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism.
3. Risk of sexual harassment suits.
As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the
workplace in the form of a company-wide policy.

It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to
protect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the
intent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,
thereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management.
This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):

1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:
a. A department head or any other member of that department.
b. General Manager and any other hotel employee.
c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department.

1. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the
connection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential
conflict of interest by compromising any of the following:

a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures.
b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions.
c. Financial defalcation.
d. Alteration of hotel documentation.

It will be the responsibility of the more "senior" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to
communicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject
that responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral
reassignment of either party.

Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for
the purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to
prudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior" positions.
There is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In
that event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel.

###### Guest Privacy
Employees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on
premise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out. An
employee is in a position to observe the personal actions of many people. It is mandatory that
you never discuss your observations either within or outside the property. However, should you
notice anything detrimental to the property or its guests, notify your department head, the
General Manager immediately.

Keep in mind that all guest services (pool, fitness center, lobby, van, etc.) are for guest use only,
unless otherwise allowed by the GM

---

Under no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation
unless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

###### Leaving Property during Work Hours
It is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to
conduct personal business. The department head is responsible for maintaining proper staffing at
all times, so if it is necessary to leave the property at any time during work hours, the employee
must do the following:

1. Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property.
2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning.
3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns.
###### Lost and Found
When an employee finds a lost and found item, they should turn it in to the designated lost and
found location (usually the Front Desk or the Housekeeping Department) as soon as possible. All
items turned in are logged and maintained for a period of time, during which time we will
attempt to locate the rightful owner. Failure to turn in lost and found articles may be cause for
dismissal.

###### Personal Phone Calls and Visitors
Hotel telephones are for business use only.

Personal cell phones or other mobile devices may not be used during working hours, except in
the case of an incoming call for an emergency or other urgent situation.

Anyone wishing to visit an employee on the job must contact the front desk, who may contact
the employee or department head. If available, the employee may meet his/her visitor in the
lobby or other public area. Visitors will not be permitted in work areas or guest rooms.
Nonemployees may be allowed to visit employee areas only with prior approval of management
or as part of a company-sponsored program. These visits should not disrupt workflow. An
employee must accompany the nonemployee at all times. Former employees are not permitted
onto company property except for official company business.

###### Smoking
Smoking is permitted only in designated areas. Your department head will show you these
areas.

###### Transfer/Promotion
Whenever possible, job vacancies will be filled by transfer or promotion from within, by
employees who meet the requirements for the job involved. Transfers/promotions will be based
upon the skill and ability of the employee under consideration to perform the job in question.

Normally, an employee should be in a position for at least six months before applying for a
transfer or promotion.

---

###### HOTEL NON-HARASSMENT POLICY

The Hotel strives to maintain an environment where all associates will work free from
harassment. The Company will not tolerate harassment of any type.

Harassment is any offensive, unwelcome physical or verbal behavior, including but not limited
to, comments or conduct related to a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, disability or veteran status. Sexual harassment, which is unwelcome sexual
advances or other sexual behavior, is also prohibited as set forth in the Hotel’s Policy against
Sexual Harassment.

Any employee who is subjected to harassment should report all such incidents directly to
management. A Confidential Report of Harassment is available for employee use. Upon
receiving a harassment complaint, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be conducted
and, if warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken. However, no disciplinary action
will be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts. No employee will suffer retaliation or
any form of punishment for voicing a valid concern.

###### Bullying
The Hotel defines bullying as “repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether
verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the
place of work and/or in the course of employment.” Such behavior violates the company’s intent
that all employees will be treated with dignity and respect.

The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors, managers
and executives, that the company will not tolerate bullying behavior. Employees found in
violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination.

###### HOTEL POLICY AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT

The Hotel’s Policy against Sexual Harassment prohibits sexual harassment by employees
(management or non-management) wherever work or work related activities are being
performed.

Under the policy, a manager cannot state, suggest or imply that an employee's submission to or
rejection of sexual advances will in any way influence any personnel decision regarding that
employee's employment, wages, advancement, assigned duties, schedule, or any other condition
of employment.

Other physical or verbal conduct that creates a sexually offensive work place, whether
committed by management or non-management employees, is also prohibited. Examples of this

---

conduct include offensive or unwelcome sexual remarks, flirtations, advances or propositions;
offensive or unwelcome verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic statements about a person's
body; sexually degrading words used to describe a person; the display of sexually suggestive
objects or pictures; any form of unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct.

Sexual harassment at work by any employee will result in disciplinary action up to and including
dismissal, and may lead to personal legal and financial liability.

If an employee feels that they have been sexually harassed, they are encouraged to fill out a
harassment form.

Upon receiving a harassment complaint, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be
conducted and, if warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken. However, no
disciplinary action will be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts. No employee will
suffer retaliation or any form of punishment for voicing a valid concern.

If at any time an employee feels that they are being sexually harassed by a guest, vendor or
customer of the hotel, they should report the incident(s) to a department head or to the General
Manager immediately.
