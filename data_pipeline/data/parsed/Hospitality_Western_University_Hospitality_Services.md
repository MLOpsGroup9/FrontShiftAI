Welcome to the Team!

Congratulations and welcome. We are pleased

to have you join our award-winning Hospitality
Services department. We know you have lots

of choices for where to work in the Hospitality
industry, and we're glad you chose Western. You're
now part of a team who cares deeply about taking
care of our guests, and contribute to a supportive
campus community made up of faculty, staff,
researchers, alumni, and our 35,000 students.

We consist of five distinct teams — Campus
Eateries, Residence Dining, Great Hall Catering,
Conference Services, and Vending Services, and
provide contract management to the Ivey School
of Business. While each area serves a specific
clientele, we are all part of the same team and
work collectively towards shared outcomes.

Feeding over 25,000 people on campus daily,
Hospitality Services staff are key to delivering
Canada's “Best Student Experience”. We all deliver
exceptional customer service everyday in different

ways; learning our guest's names, remembering
their regular orders, striking up friendly
conversations, asking how a student did on their
midterm — our Alumni often return to campus
and seek out Hospitality employees who made a
difference in their experience at Western.

| encourage you to spend some time looking
through the Employee Handbook carefully and
return the signed acknowledgement form to
your Supervisor within two weeks of receiving
this publication.

Again, | am extremely pleased to welcome you to
Hospitality Services and look forward to working
with you.

Sincerely,
Chris Alleyne

Associate Vice-President

+ Keep COLD things COLD below 40°F (4°C)

Cooling

All cooked food must be chilled quickly to 40°F
(4°C) within 6 hours to prevent a potential
food-borne illness. Large quantity batches

can be chilled using an ice bath, with an

ice wand or divided into
shallow pans to increase the
surface area before storing
in the refrigerator. Use a
thermometer to determine
the internal temperature of
the product.

Reheating

Precooked foods to be
reheated must be rewarmed
rapidly to 165°F (74°C) using
equipment to do so. A hot
box or steam table is not
appropriate for reheating.

COOKING ZONE “=

DANGER ZONE

COLD ZONE

Thawing

Products should be thawed under refrigeration
or under cold running water in their original
wrapping never at room temperature.

Thermometers

Metal Stem or Instant Read Digital thermometers
are available to check product internal
temperatures. These thermometers need to be
cleaned between uses with alcohol swabs and
should be calibrated frequently.

All fridges and Freezers are equipped with
thermometers and should be checked regularly.

Cross Contamination

It is important to take all precautions to avoid
Cross Contamination of products meaning the
process by which bacteria, microorganisms

or hazardous materials are unintentionally
transferred from one product to another with
harmful effect through careless practices.

To avoid cross contamination practice
the following:

+ Wash hands between tasks
+ Sanitize thermometers after each use

+ When thawing raw foods in the
refrigerator, place them on the
lowest shelf

+ Use a clean designated scoop for ice, do
not use hands or other container

- All staff beverages should be in a cup
with lid and stored in designated area to
avoid spilling and contaminating food
prep areas
