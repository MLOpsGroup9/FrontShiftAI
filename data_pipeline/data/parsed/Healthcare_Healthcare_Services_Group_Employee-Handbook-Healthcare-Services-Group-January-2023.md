**INTRODUCTION**

Welcome! Healthcare Services Group, Inc. ("Healthcare" or "the Company"), since its
inception in 1977, has been in the forefront of providing housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility
maintenance, and food services which improve quality and reduce costs to our clients in the
health care industry. Our clients include:

 Nursing Homes

 Rehabilitation Centers

 Assisted Living Facilities

 Retirement Facilities

 Hospitals

Healthcare has established itself as a leader in providing cost-effective means of
outsourcing indirect patient/resident care services. As a result, our clients can maximize the
attention paid to their direct care responsibilities.

Healthcare has been able to bring a high level of professionalism to managing these
ancillary services. Healthcare prides itself on creating a partnership with our clients to focus
on delivering the highest quality care to the patients/residents of health care facilities.

This Employee Handbook is an extension of that professional approach. It shows our
commitment to quality operations using an approach that will deliver the best service possible.
This Handbook is intended to provide you with information about some of the working
conditions, employee benefits, and Company policies effecting your employment. Obviously,
the information, policies, and benefits described here are subject to change, without prior notice.
Accordingly, this Handbook is not intended to be a contract. Furthermore, where this Handbook
is inconsistent with a collective bargaining agreement, the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement will govern. Similarly, Healthcare operates in many different states. Should any
portion of this Handbook be inconsistent with the law of a particular state, that state law will
govern.

**FINALLY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND**
**THAT THEIR EMPLOYMENT IS FOR NO DEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND**
**THAT, JUST AS AN EMPLOYEE MAY TERMINATE HIS/HER EMPLOYMENT AT**
**ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE OR CAUSE, SO TOO MAY THE COMPANY**
**TERMINATE OR MODIFY THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AT ANY TIME,**
**WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR CAUSE, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY**
**LAW.**

---

**THE COMPANY**

The Company is dedicated to four simple business principles:

1. Service. To provide our clients (patients, residents, families, visitors, andemployees) with the best service possible with a concentration on consistency,
quality control, and systems operations. Our standardized operation methods are
set and never compromised.

1. Professionalism. To bring to our industry and our services a professionalapproach. All employees will be professional at all times.

1. Cost Efficiency. To operate the department in the most cost-effective mannerpossible. By standardizing operations, maintaining controls, and planning
schedules, the cost of operations can be controlled.

1. Growth. To expand our operations through a satisfied client base and astrong management team, preferably developed by promoting from within.

**EMPLOYMENT AT-WILL**

It is the policy of the Company that all employees are employed at the will of the
Company. Employees are subject to termination at any time, for any reason, with or without
cause or notice. At the same time, employees may terminate their employment at any time and
for any reason.

No Company representative is authorized to modify this policy for any employee or to
enter into any agreement, oral or written, that changes the at-will relationship.

**PROBATION PERIOD**

The first ninety (90) days of employment with Healthcare will be called the Probation
Period. During this time, your supervisor will pay extra attention to your training progress, the
quality of your work, your attendance/tardiness record, your attitude, and your ability to
cooperate with co-workers, residents, patients, and visitors.

Completion of the Probation Period does not change the employee's status as an at-will
employee or in any way restrict the Company's right to terminate the employee or change the
terms and conditions of employment.

**POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION**

**Purpose**

The Company is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated
with respect and dignity. This commitment includes a work environment free of unlawful
harassment and unlawful discrimination. It also includes a work environment free of retaliation
for reporting claims of harassment and/or discrimination, or for participating in an investigation of
a complaint of harassment or discrimination. Our policy is to educate employees as to the
behaviors that constitute harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination, and to make them
aware of reporting procedures and consequences for those who engage in these prohibited
behaviors. Harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated.

**Coverage**

This policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the Company, and prohibits
harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other unprofessional conduct by or toward all employees
at all levels of the Company, as well as applicants, unpaid interns, volunteers, independent
contractors, temporary workers, vendors, client representatives and other customers.

**Individual Employee Liability for Harassment**

All employees at all levels in the Company (non-supervisors, supervisors, managers, directors,
vice presidents, etc.) who engage in unlawful harassment not only violate this policy, but can be
held personally liable/responsible for monetary damages that stem from the harassing conduct.

**Workplace Harassment is a Form of Discrimination**

Unlawful harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Please be aware that some state laws may
provide for enhanced protection.

Unlawful harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person’s legally protected characteristics,
including those listed in this policy where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition
of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work
environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name
calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs,
offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a
variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:

 The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the

employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee.
 The victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the

offensive conduct.
 Unlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim.

---

**Prohibited Conduct and Examples of Harassment in Violation of this Policy**

In keeping with this commitment, the Company maintains a strict policy prohibiting all forms of
unlawful harassment and discrimination of any kind, as defined under federal law, state law, or
any other applicable local law or ordinance. This includes sexual harassment, and harassment
based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding or medical conditions related to
pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding), race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and
protected hairstyles), religion, religious creed (including observance, practice, beliefs, and
practices such as, religious dress and grooming practices), color, gender (including gender identity,
gender expression, transgender status, transitioning or perceived to be transitioning), national
origin (including physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics, marriage to or association with
persons of a national origin group, tribal affiliation, membership in or association with an
organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group, name
that is associated with a national origin group, accent, language use, immigration status,
citizenship, and other definitions under state laws), ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical
condition, genetic information, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status, union status, or
any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation. It also prohibits
harassment, disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on the perception that anyone has any
of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of
those characteristics.

This policy prohibits unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical, and visual
harassment. It also prohibits retaliation of any kind against individuals who file complaints of
harassment or discrimination, or who assist in an employer investigation. Employees who violate
this policy are subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination.

This policy also strictly prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined as (i) unwelcome sexual
advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s employment; or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual; or (3) such
conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual
misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of
authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. Sexual harassment includes many
forms of offensive behavior, and is not excused because the harasser is attracted to the victim of
the harassment. The following is a partial list of the types of conduct which could constitute sexual
harassment:

1. Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexualadvances, invitation or comments and comments about any employee’s body or clothing, verbal
sexual propositions via notes, letters or e-mails.

1. Visual conduct, such as leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of derogatory posters,cartoons, drawings, or gestures.

1. Physical conduct, such as assault, unwanted touching, or interference with work directedat an employee because of the employee’s sex or other protected characteristics.

---

1. Threats or demands to submit to sexual requests in order to keep one’s job or avoid someother loss, and offers of job benefits in return for sexual favors.

1. Any conduct, whether intentionally harassing or not, that has the purpose or effect ofsubstantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile,
or offensive working environment.

1. Communication via electronic media of any type that includes any harassing conduct thatis prohibited by state and/or federal law, or by company policy.

1. Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances.
**Complaints, Investigation Procedures, Response and Corrective Action**

If you believe that you have been the subject of harassment, discrimination or other prohibited
conduct, or if you learn that another individual covered by this policy may have been the subject of
conduct prohibited under this policy, you should immediately report the situation to the Healthcare
Human Resources Department (via the HR Hotline at **833-HR4-HCSG (833-474-4274) or internal**
**complaint form found on the HUB)** if the individual(s) engaged in the inappropriate conduct is
either your direct supervisor or manager, or another Company supervisor, manager or higher level
employee to whom you do not report. If the individual(s) who engaged in the inappropriate conduct
is your co-worker, you should immediately report the situation to either your supervisor, or if not
comfortable doing so, to the Healthcare Human Resources Department. Your complaint will be taken
very seriously, and you accordingly will be asked to provide details of the incident or incidents, the
names of individual(s) involved, and names of any witnesses.

Upon receiving an oral or written complaint, or information that harassment may have occurred,
the Company will undertake an effective, thorough and objective investigation of the allegations.

During the course of an investigation of the complaint or reported situation, steps may be taken,
when appropriate, to minimize contact between the complaining employee and the alleged
harasser. Such actions may include schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave,
usually for the alleged harasser.

All complaints of harassment and/or discrimination shall be maintained discreetly, consistent with
the disclosure that is necessary to fully, fairly and promptly investigate the complaint or situation
that was reported. Complaints shall be investigated in a fair, timely and thorough manner that
provides all parties appropriate due process, and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the
evidence collected.

If the Company determines that harassment or other prohibited conduct has occurred, effective
remedial action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include
immediate termination of employment, when warranted.

Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee(s), supervisor(s) or manager(s) who attempt
to discourage or prevent any harassment victim, victim of discrimination or retaliation, or witness
to such conduct, from using the Company’s complaint procedure to report the conduct.

---

If the person who engaged in harassment is not employed by the Company, then the Company will
take whatever corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

**Filing of Complaints Outside of Our Company**

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and other state and local
agencies investigate, seek to resolve and provide remedies for illegal harassment. Employees may
contact the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000 or [](http://www.eeoc.gov/)[www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov/)[.](http://www.eeoc.gov/) The nearest office of the EEOC or other
agency may be found online or in the local telephone directory.

**Prohibition Against Any Form of Retaliation**

Acts of retaliation made against an individual who reported sexual harassment or discrimination
are against the law. The Company will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee
or individual who has complained of being a victim of or a witness to harassment or discrimination.
Nor will the Company tolerate retaliation against any employee, independent contractor, intern or
other individual doing business with the Company because the individual participated in the
investigation of a complaint. All individuals should feel free and safe to report claims and
participate as a witness in the investigation of complaints without fear of retaliation of any kind.

If you believe that you have suffered retaliation for making a good faith complaint about
discrimination or harassment, or because you participated as a witness in an investigation of a
complaint, please immediately report the situation to the Healthcare Human Resources
Department. Any finding of retaliation shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

If there are any questions concerning this policy, please contact the Healthcare Human Resources
Department.

**Acceptance of Policy**

Everyone at the Company has a personal responsibility to conduct themselves in compliance with
this policy and to report any conduct inconsistent with this policy. If you have any questions
concerning this policy, please contact your immediate supervisor or the Healthcare Human
Resources Department.

**EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND WORK RULES**

To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, the Company expects employees
to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the Company.

It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The
performance standards listed below, and others which may be established from time to time obviously are not
all-inclusive, but are intended only to indicate some of the types of actions that are unacceptable in the
workplace. These performance standards are merely examples of the types of misconduct for which employees
may be disciplined or dismissed. By providing these examples, the Company in no way restricts its legal
discretion to discipline employees or terminate the employment relationship at will. Unacceptable conduct not
specifically listed may, nonetheless, result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. If an employee
needs clarification of a specific issue related to these standards, she/he should seek clarification from his/her
immediate supervisor, or the Healthcare Services Group, Inc. Human Resources Department.

Employees should understand that discipline is directed at the specific act, not the individual.

###### HOURS OF WORK

The workweek is Sunday through Saturday. The normal workday generally will include an unpaid
meal period of at least 30 minutes, during which the employee must be completely relieved from duty. Rest
or coffee breaks of short duration will be counted as paid hours worked.

The schedule of work hours for employees will be determined by their supervisor. The supervisor
will inform each employee of their daily schedule of hours to work, including meal periods and rest/coffee
breaks. **Employees are not permitted to work overtime without the prior approval of their supervisor.**

Employee attendance at meetings and in-service training programs will be considered hours worked,
and therefore will be compensated time if attendance is requested by their supervisor.

All non-exempt (hourly paid) employees are required to punch a time clock or complete an
individual time record showing the daily hours worked. Time records cover one workweek and must be
completed by the close of each workday. The following procedures must be followed in filling out time
records:

1. **Employees must record their starting time, time out for meal periods, time in after**
**meal periods, and quitting time for each workday.**

1. **Employees are not permitted to punch in, sign in, or begin work seven (7) or more**
**minutes before their scheduled start time, or to punch out, sign out, or continue to**
**work for seven (7) or more minutes after the end of their scheduled quitting time,**
**without the prior approval of their supervisor.**

1. **Work time will be rounded based upon an employee's start and stop time to the nearest**
**quarter (1/4 or 15 minutes) of an hour.**

1. **Employees are required to take scheduled meal breaks, and must record the time**
**out for meal breaks and the time in after meal breaks.**

1. **Employee time records must be checked and approved by their supervisor before**
**submitting for payroll processing. Employee time records missing time in or time**
**out recordings (including meal breaks) must be corrected and then signed by the**
**employee as agreeing to the correction prior to submission for payroll processing.**

1. **Employees will be counseled about their responsibility for recording their hours worked**
**accurately.**

1. **Punching in another employee's time card, filling out another employee's time**
**record, or falsifying any time record is prohibited and will result in immediate**
**discharge.**

1. **Under no circumstances, are employees to work off the clock (all work time must be**
**properly recorded).**

---

###### CALL-IN REQUIREMENTS

Reporting to work on your scheduled workdays and being on time are very important, and
excessive absences or lateness can lead to discharge. If for any reason you will not be able to work a
scheduled shift, or you will be getting to work late, you must call-in as soon as possible so that your
supervisor will have time to try to make adjustments to the schedule.

Your supervisor will give you a form with specific instructions about the call-in requirements for
the facility you are working in. You must follow those instructions. If you lose that form, or never
received it, be sure to get one from your supervisor. Note that you must talk to your supervisor directly
as part of your call-in responsibilities.

###### OVERTIME

In most instances, overtime compensation will be calculated on the basis of the federal law
requiring payment on the basis of a 40-hour workweek, with no daily overtime rules. Each work week
begins on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday, each week independent of the other for overtime
pay.

State laws and collective bargaining agreements may provide for a more favorable lower daily
threshold (e.g. over 7.5 hours in a day) or a lower weekly threshold (e.g. 37.5 hours in a workweek)
requiring overtime pay. Affected employees must be paid overtime pay based upon the more favorable
daily or weekly threshold.

The company is not eligible to use the eighty (80) hours worked in a two (2) workweek period
as a basis for paying overtime. Any collective bargaining agreement citing the eighty (80) hour overtime
rule must not be used and overtime payments must be based upon the 40-hour workweek rule.

###### REQUESTING, BORROWING, OR ACCEPTING MONEY, TIPS, OR GIFTS FROM

###### PATEINTS/RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

To avoid even the appearance of inappropriate conduct, Healthcare strictly prohibits requesting,
borrowing, or accepting money, tips, or gifts from patients/residents or their family members.

---

###### VACATION

Paid vacation is not accrued. It is granted only to employees who are continuing their employment.
Therefore, employees will not be paid for "unused" vacation resulting from their termination for any reason,
including termination of the Company's service agreement. No payments will be made for forfeited vacation
days.

The amount of vacation time will be determined based upon the Company's policy at each facility. All
vacation is to be taken during the year following the anniversary date of employment, and it may not be
accumulated.

The following steps should be followed when requesting vacation:

1. Decide when you would like to take your vacation.

2. Inform your supervisor in writing, at least thirty (30) days before the desiredtime period (the sooner the better).

1. Your supervisor will make the final determination as to the availability of thedesired time. (Because of operational requirements, not all vacation requests can
be granted.)

1. If your desired time is unavailable, select another time.

###### HOLIDAYS

Eligible full-time employees shall be entitled to pay for designated holidays. The particular holidays
and determination of eligibility will be based upon the Company's policy at each facility. Company holidays
normally include:

New Year’s Day Labor Day
Memorial Day Thanksgiving Day
Independence Day Christmas Day

---

###### SICK DAYS

An eligible full-time employee (as defined by Company policy at each facility) will be paid for a
limited number of sick days missed due to illness. The amount of paid sick days will be based upon
continuous employment and will be determined based upon Company policy at each facility.

**Whether you are eligible for a paid sick day or not, the following steps must be followed**
**when reporting off sick:**

1. You must telephone your facility and notify your supervisor of your absence atleast one (1) hour prior to the start of your shift. Note that you must talk to your
supervisor directly as part of your call-in responsibilities.

1. If you are out for an extended sick period of time (i.e., absent for 5 or moreconsecutive days that you would have been scheduled to work), a doctor's note
will be required upon returning to work. (Unless otherwise agreed with your
supervisor, each day out sick you must follow Step 1.)

1. Failure to provide a doctor's note upon returning to work from an extendedsick period (i.e., absent for 5 or more consecutive days that you would have
been scheduled to work) could result in termination.

1. Medical clearance from your doctor will be required, in writing, before youcan return to work from an extended sick period (i.e., absent for 5 or more
consecutive days that you would have been scheduled to work).

Sick days may not be accumulated from year to year. Employees will not be paid for unused sick days
resulting from their termination for any reason, including termination of the Company's service
agreement with the facility. No payments will be made for forfeited sick days. No pro-rated sick days
will be issued to part-time employees.

**JURY DUTY**

The Company recognizes the need to provide this community service and employees will receive
their regular rate of pay for normal hours scheduled, up to a maximum of 10 days of jury service per
calendar year. Jury duty will be granted to employees upon prompt notification to their supervisor of a jury
summons and subsequent notice of selection to serve as a juror. Employees will be allowed to retain any
mileage and other compensation paid by the respective court jurisdiction.

**BEREAVEMENT LEAVE**

In the event of the death of a member of a full-time employee's immediate family (spouse, child,
parent, brother, or sister), the employee will receive paid time off based upon the Company's policy at
each facility, but not to exceed three (3) days off.

In the event of the death of a grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew, the employee will
receive the day of the funeral off with pay.

---

**UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE**

Healthcare provides three types of unpaid leaves of absence, depending upon the
circumstances of the employee's need and the employee's employment status: Military
Leave, Family and Medical Leave, and Personal Leave. Each is described below.

Requests for any type of unpaid leave of absence must be submitted to your supervisor at
least one (1) month in advance of the expected starting date, or as soon as reasonably possible.
You will need to state the reason for the leave, the requested date of the beginning of the leave,
and the date you expect to return from the leave. Requests normally will be approved or denied
within ten (10) days of receipt of the request.

Employees who have been granted unpaid leave are prohibited from working
elsewhere in any capacity that is inconsistent with the reason for their leave, without the
written permission of their supervisor. Violators may be discharged.

***A.*** ***MILITARY LEAVE***

Employees will be granted Military Leave in accordance with applicable law.

**B. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE**

Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees may take an unpaid
family or medical leave of absence (Family/Medical Leave) of up to 12 weeks in a 12-month
period. Eligible employees may take up to 26 weeks (less other FMLA-covered leave already
taken) of unpaid FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a Covered Service member,
as described below. To be eligible for a Family/Medical Leave, an employee must have worked
for the Company for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to
taking the leave, and work at a worksite with 50 or more employees located within 75 miles. Hours
worked means actual hours worked and generally does not include paid or unpaid time off.
However, periods of absence from work due to or necessitated by qualifying military service are
counted towards an employee’s eligibility for FMLA leave.

The “12-month period” for determining FMLA eligibility is a rolling period, measured backward
from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. With the exception of Covered Service member
Leave, discussed below, this 12-month period is measured backward from the date any leave under
this policy is taken. Any leave taken pursuant to this policy, other Company policies, or law which
qualifies as leave under the FMLA will be counted against the employee’s available leave under
the applicable Company policy(s) and law, as well as the available leave under the FMLA, to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

**Reasons For Leave**

If eligible, an employee may take Family/Medical Leave for any of the following reasons:

---

**Birth/Placement** . The birth of an employee’s child, or the placement of a child with an employee

for adoption or foster care.

Employees must conclude Birth/Placement Leave within one year following the child’s

birth or placement.

**Family Care** . To care for an employee’s spouse, child, or parent, as defined below under

“Definitions”, with a serious health condition.

**Employee Medical** . When due to an employee’s own serious health condition, which makes the

employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the employee’s job.
Pregnancy-related disability, pre-natal medical care and childbirth are covered under the
FMLA.

**Qualifying Exigency** . Due to a qualifying exigency as defined in the FMLA final regulations,

arising out of the fact that an employee’s parent, child or spouse is on active military duty
or has been notified of any impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces in
support of a contingency operation as a member of the National Guard or Reserves.
Qualifying Exigency Leave is not available to employees whose military family members
are in the Regular Armed Forces. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain
military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal
arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, attending post-deployment
reintegration briefings, and other activities associated with the family member’s call or
order to service. Contact the Healthcare Human Resources Department for additional
information regarding what constitutes a qualifying exigency.

**Covered Service member** . To care for a parent, child, spouse or individual for whom the

employee is next of kin, who is a current member of the Armed Forces, including the
National Guard and Reserves, and who is receiving treatment for or recovering from a
serious illness or injury incurred in the line of active duty. Such leave may be taken for up
to 26 weeks in a single 12-month period, which period begins on the first day an employee
takes leave for this purpose and ends 12 months after that date. An eligible employee who
takes Covered Service member Leave may not take more than a combined total of 26 weeks
of FMLA Leave in a 12-month period, including any leave taken for other FMLA-covered
reasons. Under such circumstances, no more than 12 weeks of FMLA Leave in a 12-month
period may be taken for reasons other than to care for a Covered Service member.

An employee may not be granted a Family/Medical Leave to gain employment or work elsewhere,
including self-employment. If an employee misrepresents facts in order to be granted a
Family/Medical Leave, he/she will be subject to immediate termination.

**Definitions**

CHILD - For Family Care and Birth/Placement Leaves, a child is a biological, adopted, foster, or
stepchild or a legal ward or a child of a person standing in the place of the child’s parent, who is
either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical
disability. For Covered Service member and Qualifying Exigency Leaves, a child is a biological,

---

adopted, foster, or step child or a legal ward or a child for whom the employee stood in the place
of a parent, who is on active duty or call to active duty status, and who is of any age.

SPOUSE - A spouse is a husband or wife as recognized under state law, including common law
marriage where it is recognized.

PARENT - A parent is a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, step-parent, legal guardian, or an
individual who stood in the place of a parent to an employee when the employee was a child. It
does not include parents-in-law.

SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION - A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment,
or a physical or mental condition that involves (1) inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a
hospital, hospice or residential care facility, including any period of incapacity or any treatment in
connection with such inpatient care; (2) any period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend
school or perform other regular daily activities) of more than three consecutive calendar days that
also involves continuing treatment by a health care provider; (3) any period of incapacity or
treatment due to a chronic health condition requiring periodic treatment; (4) any period of
incapacity which is permanent or long-term for a condition for which treatment may not be
effective and the employee or family member is under the continuing supervision of a health care
provider; (5) any period of absence to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a
condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days if left
untreated; or (6) incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.

COVERED SERVICEMEMBER - A Covered Service member is a member of the Armed Forces,
including the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or
therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disabled retired list, for
a serious illness or injury. For purposes of Covered Service member Leave, “serious illness or
injury” means an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed
Forces that may render the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her
office, grade, rank or rating.

NEXT OF KIN - A next of kin is the nearest blood relative of a Covered Service member, other
than the Service member’s spouse, parent, or child.

**Notice of Leave**

If the need for Family/Medical Leave (other than Qualifying Exigency Leave, explained below) is
foreseeable, employees must give the Company at least 30 days’ prior notice of the need for leave,
if possible, or as much notice as practicable under the circumstances. Employees are required to
make reasonable efforts to schedule a foreseeable leave to avoid disruption of Company
operations, subject to the approval of the appropriate health care provider. If the need for leave is
not foreseeable, employees are expected to notify the Company as soon as practicable under the
circumstances. Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delaying or denying the leave.
An employee requesting Qualifying Exigency Leave should provide as much notice as is
reasonable and practicable under the circumstances. An employee should submit a written request
for Family/Medical Leave of Absence, which includes the anticipated date(s) and duration of the

---

requested leave. No Family/Medical Leave will be granted without the approval of the Healthcare
Human Resources Department.

**Certification**

If a leave is requested because of the employee’s or a covered family member’s serious health
condition or to care for a Covered Service member, the employee and the relevant health care
provider must supply appropriate medical certification. Medical Certification Forms may be
obtained from the Healthcare Human Resources Department. If the need for leave is foreseeable,
the medical certification should be provided to the Company prior to the commencement of the
leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, then the medical certification must be provided
within fifteen (15) days after it is requested, or as deadline extensions are granted in writing by
Healthcare’s Human Resources

Department. It is the employee’s responsibility, not the health care provider’s, to ensure that
Healthcare’s Human Resources Department receives the fully completed medical certification by
the deadline. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in
delay or denial of leave. Under certain circumstances, the Company, at its expense, may require
an examination of the employee by a second health care provider designated by the Company. If
the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the
Company, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct
an examination and provide a final and binding opinion. The Company also may require medical
recertification periodically during the leave and may ask for clarification of any medical
certification submitted.

Certification also is required for Qualifying Exigency Leave. Certification forms are available
from the Healthcare Human Resources Department.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities
covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or
family member of the individual, *except* as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this
law, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to a request for
medical information. “Genetic information,” as defined by GINA, includes an individual’s family
medical history, the results of an individual’s or family member’s genetic tests, the fact that an
individual or an individual’s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic
information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual’s family member or an embryo
lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.

**Reporting While on Leave**

During a Family/Medical Leave, employees may be required to contact their supervisors
periodically to report on their status and intention to return to work.

**Leave Is Unpaid/Substitution of Paid Leave**

FMLA leave is unpaid leave, except that employees will be required to use any available paid sick
time during their leave. The receipt of disability, workers’ compensation, or the substitution of
paid leave for unpaid leave time does not extend the maximum Family/Medical Leave period.

---

**Medical and Other Benefits**

During an approved Family/Medical Leave, the Company will maintain an employee’s group
health benefits as if the employee had continued to be actively employed, for up to a total of weeks (or 26 weeks if Covered Service member Leave is taken) in a 12-month period. If an
employee takes more than 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if applicable) of approved Family/Medical Leave
in a 12-month period, then the employee may elect to continue coverage at the employee’s sole
expense through COBRA for up to 18 months or until the employee returns to work . If paid leave
is substituted for unpaid Family/Medical Leave, the Company will deduct the employee’s portion
of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If the leave is unpaid, an employee
must pay his/her portion of the premium during the leave. Group health care coverage may cease
for the remainder of the leave if the premium payment is more than 30 days late. If an employee
does not return to work at the end of the leave period, he or she may be required to reimburse the
Company for the cost of the premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during
unpaid leave, unless the employee cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or
other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.

**Intermittent Or Reduced Schedule Leave**

Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a
schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of hours per workweek or hours per workday.

1. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child (sometimes referred to as“baby-bonding” leave) may be taken on an intermittent basis only if mutually
agreed to, in writing, by Healthcare Human Resources Department, but may not be
taken on a part-time or reduced work schedule basis;

1. Leave due to an employee’s own serious health condition, to care for an employee’sspouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a Service
member relative with a serious injury or illness, may be taken all at once or, where
medically necessary, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule;

1. Leave because of a qualifying exigency due to the covered active duty or impendingcall to duty of a spouse, son, daughter or parent may be taken all at once or on an
intermittent or reduced work schedule.

If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your remuneration based on the amount of time
actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
foreseeable, planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule the
treatment so as to accommodate the Company’s needs and not disrupt unduly the Company’s
operations. When you take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable, planned
medical treatment, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position
for which you are qualified and which better accommodates your recurring leave and has
equivalent pay and benefits.

---

**Returning From Leave**

Generally, upon return from Family/Medical Leave, employees will be reinstated to the same
position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms,
subject to any applicable exceptions. In addition, employees have no greater rights to
reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not taken the
Family/Medical Leave. As provided by law, under certain other circumstances, reinstatement
following Family/Medical Leave may be denied. In addition, any right to reinstatement terminates
if an employee fails to return to work at the end of an approved leave, in accordance with applicable
law.

If leave is taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition, then the employee must
provide medical certification addressing the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the job. Employees failing to provide a release to return to work when required to do so will
not be permitted to resume work until such certification is provided.

**Legal Compliance**

This policy will be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws, and to the extent that this policy may conflict with those laws, they are controlling over this
policy. Further, the Company retains all available rights and defenses under applicable law,
whether or not specifically set forth in this policy.

C. ***PERSONAL LEAVE***

Employees who have completed their probationary period may apply for a Personal Leave for a
period up to three (3) months for reasons other than those listed above. Personal Leave may also
be requested by employees who have completed their probationary period but who do not meet
the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, or who have exhausted their FMLA leave, or by
employees who need a period of leave due to a "disability" within the meaning of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (or similar state law).

Personal Leave requests are not granted automatically; rather, the decision whether to grant a
request for Personal Leave is within the sole discretion of the Company. Factors that the
Company will consider include: the employee's work history, including attendance records; the
Company's operational/staffing needs; and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (and comparable state laws).

An employee returning from Personal Leave usually will be restored to his/her former
position and shift or to a position with similar pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions
of employment. However, Healthcare cannot guarantee that an employee out on a Personal
Leave will be returned to his or her former position.

Employees on a Personal Leave shall not accrue vacation, holiday, or sick leave. Employees on
a Personal Leave of more than one month who are covered under the Company's health
insurance plan at the start of that Personal Leave shall be offered the opportunity, under
COBRA, to continue that coverage at their own expense, provided they make timely payments.

---

**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

Your judgment is one of your most valuable assets. You should avoid any activity or
association which conflicts or appears to conflict with your independent judgment and
Healthcare's best interest. Conflicts can arise in many situations, and it is impossible to cover
them all here. In doubtful cases, consult your supervisor before taking any action.

These guidelines apply to the most common conflict situations:

1. Do not make investments that might affect your business decisions.

2. Do not accept gifts, loans, or preferential treatment from anyone doing business withHealthcare.

1. Get clearance from the Compliance Officer (at 1-800-523-2248) before doing businesson Healthcare's behalf with any company in which you, or a close family member, may
benefit from your actions.

1. Do not work for a supplier, client, or competitor while working for Healthcare or do anywork for a third party that may adversely affect your performance or judgment on the job.

1. Do not become involved in non-company business related interests which require timeduring regular business hours. Even charitable activities during business hours require
prior approval of the employee's supervisor.

1. Do not misuse company information to which you have access as an employee, whetheror not confidential or proprietary.

**PATIENT/RESIDENT ABUSE/NEGLECT**

"Abuse" is the infliction of physical or mental injury, or the causing of the deterioration
of a patient/resident, by any means including, but not limited to, sexual abuse, exploitation, or
extortion of funds or other things of value, to such an extent that his/her health, morale, or
emotional wellbeing is endangered.

**"Neglect"** is the failure to provide the proper or necessary medical care, nutrition, or
other services necessary for a patient/resident's well-being.

If You Abuse A Patient/Resident You May Be Prosecuted

Patients/Residents are to be treated with dignity and respect at all times and under all
circumstances. Mistreatment in the form of verbal or physical abuse of any nature will not be
tolerated. Any employee guilty of abusing a patient/resident is subject to immediate discharge.
Local and State authorities will be notified immediately and criminal charges may be filed
against any employee guilty of abuse. Employees found guilty of abuse and/or neglect may be
fined and/or imprisoned as prescribed by applicable law.

If You See Abuse Or Neglect You Must Report It

Any employee who has actual knowledge of the abuse or neglect of a patient/resident
shall immediately submit a complaint to the employee's supervisor (or if the employee's
supervisor is not immediately available, to the Administrator or Nursing Supervisor).

Immunity

Any employee reporting abuse or neglect in which they are not involved is immune from
discipline. Any employee making a bad faith, malicious, or reckless report, however, may be
subject to discipline by the Company, in addition to possible criminal penalties and/or civil
liability.

---

**PATIENTS'/RESIDENTS' RIGHTS**

As a service provider for health care facilities, Healthcare endorses and respects the
patients'/residents' right to privacy and the protection and preservation of their dignity,
individuality, and independence. The facility is the home of the patient/resident and all
employees must conduct themselves accordingly.

All employees are required to become familiar with, and follow, the patients'/residents'
rights policy of the facility. Healthcare will provide training on the facility's particular
patients'/residents' rights policy and procedures. A typical policy provides for, among other
things, the following patient/resident rights:
**Consideration, dignity,** and **respect** in treatment and care.

1. Privacy related to personal care, treatment, visits with family and friends,and
communication.

1. **Use and quite enjoyment of his/her room,** including the right to close the door,and
retain and use personal clothing and possessions.

1. Participation in the **planning of total care and medical treatment,** includingbeing fully informed of medical condition, selecting a doctor, and refusing
treatment.

1. Participation in **patient/resident councils** to make complaints andrecommend
facility policy changes.

1. Management of the patient's/resident's **own financial affairs.**

2. **Confidentiality** of patient/resident records.

**HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND**

**ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)**

HIPAA PRIVACY RULE AS IT RELATES TO OUR SERVICES

The federal government's HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that Personal Health Information
about patients/residents is protected and kept private and secure. Under HIPAA's privacy and
information security section, it is illegal to release health information to inappropriate parties or
fail to adequately protect Personal Health Information from release. The HIPAA Privacy Rule
applies to covered entities — most health care providers — including long term care facilities
and assisted living facilities.

Most health care providers do not carry out all their health care activities by themselves.
Instead, they often use the services of a variety of other persons and businesses. These other
persons and businesses are called Business Associates in the HIPAA law. Business Associates
perform functions on behalf of the health care provider and are bound by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. From time to time, a Business Associate in performing its duties will come in contact with
Personal Health Information. Rules governing the use and disclosure of Personal Health
Information apply to Business Associates, as well as health care providers.

Healthcare is not a Business Associate when it provides Housekeeping/Laundry/
Maintenance services. HIPAA specifically excludes entities that provide
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance services from the law because the work being performed
does not involve the use or disclosure of Personal Health Information. However, since our
Housekeeping/Laundry/ Maintenance employees may inadvertently come in contact with
Personal Health Information, they need to have a general awareness of the law.

Healthcare is a Business Associate when it provides Food Services and is required to
comply with HIPAA. Food Service consists of the development of a meal plan that meets the
patients/residents dietary needs in connection with the over all medical plan developed in
conjunction with the health care facility. In meeting its responsibilities, Healthcare's Food
Service department on a regular basis comes in contact with residents'/patients' Personal
Health Information and must keep this information confidential.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule creates national standards to protect individual's medical
records and other Personal Health Information.

 It gives patients/residents more control over their health information.

 It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.

 It establishes appropriate safeguards that workers in a health care facility
must follow to protect the privacy of health information.

 It holds violators accountable.

---

Violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule carry both civil and criminal penalties for "wrongful
disclosure" that can include fines and jail time in certain circumstances. Failing to protect
residents'/patients' information and records by not following our privacy and security policies may
result in disciplinary action.

What Is Confidential Personal Health Information?

Patients/residents expect that only the people who are caring for them will see their health
information and that it will only be used to help care for them. Confidential Personal Health
Information includes:

 Patient/Resident Identity

 Address

 Age

 Social Security Number

 Any other personal information that patients/residents are asked to provide.

 Diagnosis, treatments, and medications that patients/residents may receive, and other
observations about their conditions or past health conditions.

The facility collects Personal Health Information so it can care for the patient/resident and
perform other related functions. Depending upon your job responsibilities, if you do not need to
know confidential Personal Health Information, you will not be given access to it. That means that
you should not look at medical records, either in the computer or in paper form.

There are occasions when you will have access to confidential Personal Health Information.
For example, if a patient/resident is placed in isolation, you may become aware of why he/she is
there or you may suspect you know why. You may see confidential Personal Health Information
about patients/residents in various places throughout the facility. Remember this information is
confidential and must not be communicated to anyone else. This information is not to be used by
you in any way or told to anyone, including coworkers, other patients/residents, visitors, or anyone
else who may ask you about it.

---

Ways to Protect Confidentiality

**Housekeeping/Laundry/Maintenance and Food Service Employees:**

 Employees should knock on the door and ask to enter before entering a
resident's/patient's room.

 If you find you are overhearing someone discuss patient/resident care information
remember to keep it confidential.

 If visitors ask you for information about a patient/resident, direct them to the
information desk for assistance rather than giving out information yourself.

 Anytime you come in contact with Personal Health Information, whether part of your
job responsibilities or not, remember to keep it confidential.

**Food Service Employees:**

 Patient/resident care or discussion about the resident's/patient's care is kept private
by closing room doors or drawing privacy curtains and conducting discussions so
that others may not overhear them.

 Patient/resident medical records must not be left where others can see or have
access to them. Keep residents'/patients' records locked away and out of public
areas. If you find records unattended, give them to your supervisor.

 Paper records must be treated as though they contain Personal Health Information
and are confidential.

 Employees who use computerized records must not leave their computers
logged into resident information while they are not at their workstation.

 Computer screens containing patient/resident information should be turned away
from the view of the public or people passing by.

 Do not write your password down, post it, or keep it where others can find it.

 Do not store Personal Health Information in common files.

 Never remove written records or computer equipment, disks, or software from the
facility.

---

Protecting confidentiality depends on you. You must not share information that you overhear or
see in the course of your work. Doing so is a violation of the law. When you do see or hear
information in the course of doing your job, remember that the information is confidential and you
are not allowed to repeat it or share it with others. This applies even when you no longer work at
the facility.

Reporting Non-Compliance

Employees are encouraged to report non-compliance to your immediate supervisor. If you
feel that corrective action has not been taken concerning your report, you should contact
Healthcare's Corporate Compliance Officer at 1-800-523-2248. Employees will not be punished
for reporting violations. It is considered part of your job responsibilities to report instances where
you suspect that the privacy or confidentiality policies have been broken.

**CHEMICAL USE**

Like most jobs, there are possible hazards that you should be aware of before beginning
employment. The chemicals that you use are never dangerous when used in their proper dilution
and for the use for which they are intended. However, if a patient/resident were to swallow a
chemical, or you were to accidentally spray yourself in the eye, adverse reactions can and will
occur. Always follow these guidelines:

1. Never use a chemical for something other than for what it is intended.

2. Always make sure that all bottles have proper labels. If not, report it immediately toyour supervisor.

1. Avoid using old bottles for new chemicals. Even though the bottle may appear dry, aresidue of the previous chemical often remains and could cause a chemical reaction.

1. Each housekeeping cart has a lockbox. All chemicals are to be stored in the lockbox.Do not leave your cart unattended. Store it properly while you are on break.

1. If you leave chemicals in the janitor's closets, the door must be locked!

2. NEVER MIX CHEMICALS!!!!

---

**FIRE PROCEDURE AND EVACUATION PLAN**

As a service provider for health care facilities, Healthcare's employees must be aware of
the fire procedure and evacuation plan of the facility in which they work. Employees will be
required to assist facility personnel as instructed. Healthcare will provide training on the
facility's particular fire procedure and evacuation plan, including:

1. Location and use of fire extinguishers.

2. Location and operation of the fire alarm system.

3. Patient/resident evacuation procedures and your responsibilities.

4. Notification procedures and actions to be taken if you are the person who locatedthe fire.

In the event of a fire:

1. Evacuation of patients/residents from the area comes first.

2. Notification should be made to the designated facility person as soon aspossible after the patients/residents have been evacuated. Be prepared to:

 Identify the location of the fire by room or location.

 Describe the size of the fire (large or small) and what is on fire.

1. Never use the word FIRE when notifying facility personnel. Instead, usethe facility's Fire Code (generally a number or color).

1. Locate and use the fire alarm when warranted.

2. Determine whether you can extinguish the fire with the available fireextinguishers and fire blankets.

1. After being notified, the facility will take charge and notify the FireDepartment, Police Department, and Evacuation Center as necessary.

1. The facility will coordinate its evacuation procedures, including your role, if any.

**SAFETY AND HEALTH POLICY**

It is the responsibility, commitment and policy of Healthcare to provide and maintain
safe and healthful working conditions throughout our organization. All employees are
responsible for complying with safe and healthy work practices. Our system of ensuring that
all employees are aware of and comply with these practices include the following:

 New employee orientation covering safety and health policies and procedures
(i.e. Hazard Communications, Bloodborne Pathogen (including Hepatitis B
vaccination), TB Awareness, Personal Protective Equipment, etc.).

 New employee training and routine re-training of existing employees on safety
and health practices.

 On-going evaluation of the safety performance of all employees.

 Re-training and disciplining (if necessary) employees for failure to comply with
safe and healthful work practices.

 Initial and routine facility inspection to identify and evaluate workplace hazards.

 Establishing open communications so that all employees are encouraged to
inform their supervisor of any safety or health hazards.

Healthcare will provide comprehensive training to all employees through our in-
service programs. Workplace safety and health training is essential, and attendance at these
training sessions is mandatory and must be documented.

**IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMS**

It is the policy of the Company to provide job training to new employees and to
provide training on safety and health issues on an on-going basis to all employees. Training
will be conducted during regular working hours and employees are required to attend.

In-Service Training programs will be conducted for the following programs, among
others:

 Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens

 Hazard Communication Program

 TB Awareness Program

 Personal Protection Equipment

---

**PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT**

All employees must comply with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act
regulations. Each employee will be trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment.
Employees must follow operating practices that will safeguard all employees, and result in a
safe working environment and efficient operation.

Any employee who is provided with safety equipment is required to wear such
equipment at all times when doing the work for which the equipment was provided.

**NEEDLE STICK INJURY PROGRAM**

Needle stick injuries require special handling. Healthcare has engaged Corporate
Wellness, Inc. ("CWI") to provide a national program to include an information resource and to
administer the program. **If you should incur a needle stick on the job, you need to do the**
**following to protect yourself:**

1. Immediately notify your supervisor of the incident.

2. Go to the nearest handwashing facility and thoroughly wash the exposed areawith soap and warm water as quickly as possible.

1. Your supervisor will complete a Needle Stick Injury Report and fax itdirectly to CWI.

**Needle sticks should be reported within one (1) hour of an incident, whenever**
**possible. CWI** is available by pager 24-hours per day, seven days a week. After receiving the
Needle Stick Injury Report, CWI will contact you and provide you with good, accurate
information about the situation. That information includes:

1. The availability of counseling.

2. The need to be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B, or both.

3. Physician selection options.

4. Treatment options.

5. Risk of infection.

6. Prevention of transmission.

7. Recommended treatments following exposures.

---

**INFECTION CONTROL**

Because many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and
are more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as
sanitary an environment as possible. By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,
employees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause
infection:

1. Direct contact with infected person.

2. Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person.

3. The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents.

4. Spread through insects.

5. Inoculation.
Some Things to Remember:

1. Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of allresident rooms and bathrooms.

1. All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contactwill not do the job.

1. Always dilute properly: too little will be ineffective, too much will be wasteful.

2. Never use a chemical on any surface until you are sure that it is safe for that purpose.

3. Since chemicals are liquid and could be swallowed, all bottles must be labeled withcontents, ingredients, and antidote.

1. No cleaning or working around food while it is being served.

2. Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentationwhich will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution.

1. Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breedinggrounds.

1. Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry.

2. Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination.

3. Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect anycommunicable disease.

1. Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because thedisinfecting agents are still at work on your skin.

1. Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs.

---

**SUBSTANCE ABUSE**

In order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients
and a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be
physically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Therefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,
illegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient
manner.

No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic
beverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in
Company vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the
safety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships
with its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal.

Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical
treatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to
their supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another
assignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public.

To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever
measures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used
at, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company
believes them to be justified and necessary. Measures that may be used will include, but not be
limited to, searches of people and of personal property located at the workplace, possibly by
law enforcement authorities, as well as drug and/or alcohol tests to be conducted when there is
reasonable suspicion of substance abuse. In addition, employees who suffer, or contribute to, a
work-related accident requiring medical treatment for any employee or facility
patient/resident, will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing if it is possible that an
impaired condition could have contributed to the accident.

When urinalysis and/or blood tests are requested or necessary, samples will be taken
under the supervision of an appropriate health care professional. The searches and drug tests
will not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit
will result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination.

Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily
seek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require
management referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered
by your medical insurance program. Successful treatment will be viewed positively. However,
participation in a treatment program will not prevent normal disciplinary action for a violation
which may have already occurred, nor will it relieve an employee of the responsibility to
perform assigned duties in a safe and efficient manner.

---

**WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE**

Healthcare provides a workers' compensation program at no cost to employees for
any injury, death, or occupational disease arising out of, and in the course of, employment.

It is very important that proper procedures be followed by all employees when injured on
the job. Although the amount of benefit coverage varies from state to state, the injured employee
may receive three basic types of benefits: medical care costs, temporary disability income, and
rehabilitation costs.

**All employees who are injured or ill resulting from a work-related incident must**
**inform their supervisor immediately.** Supervisors are required to report immediately, or as
soon as practical, to their designated Risk Manager — Workers Compensation, all incidents
involving employees under their supervision.

**HEALTH/DENTAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION**

**BY EMPLOYEES ON WORKER'S**
**COMPENSATION OR AN APPROVED LEAVE**

**OF ABSENCE**

An employee who is covered by the Company's health/dental insurance who is out on
Worker's Compensation or an approved leave of absence is responsible for reimbursing the
Company for the employee deduction (employee's cost) for health/dental insurance during the
first 30 days of absence.

If the employee's absence extends past 30 days, the employee will be responsible for the
full amount of health/dental insurance premium. If the employee does not pay the monthly
premium due within 30 days of the date specified in their Notification Letter, the health/dental
insurance will be terminated.

Eligible employees taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 will
be entitled to continue their health/dental insurance coverage for up to 12 weeks of leave,
provided the employee makes the required employee-contributions for coverage. Employees
must notify their supervisor of this request.

The District Manager must communicate the details of an employee's leave to the
Corporate Benefits Department so that the department may administer the collection of
payments.
