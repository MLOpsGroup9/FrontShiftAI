##### Introduction

##### Welcome and Purpose

The Crouse Medical Practice Employee Handbook summarizes policies, procedures, benefits
and working conditions that will be followed by all employees as a condition of their employment
with Crouse Medical Practice (CMP). These documents are available in full detail to all
employees on a shared drive. Employees will be asked to affirm that they understand where to
access such detailed policies and procedures.

Crouse Medical Practice strives to provide an employee-friendly environment in which goal-
oriented individuals thrive. Our company commitment to serving patients and providing quality
patient care is unwavering. These policies, procedures and working conditions provide a work
environment in which both patient and employee interests are served.

We value our employees’ talents, skills and abilities and seek to foster an open, cooperative and
dynamic environment in which we can all excel. Crouse Medical Practice provides an
environment where employees are encouraged to bring ideas and challenges to any level of
management.

This handbook contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be
comprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general
policies and procedures described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning
eligibility for a particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should
address your specific questions to the Human Resources Department.

No provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical
Practice’s President, or designee.

##### At-Will Employment Statement

Employment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an
employee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time,
for any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it
intended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will
employment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written
contract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual.

Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual
right, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it
guarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for
any specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by
Crouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are
disciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to
terminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps.

---

No supervisor or other representative of Crouse Medical Practice except the Owner and/or
President has the authority to enter into any contract of employment for any specified period of
time, or to make any agreement contrary to the above.

The policies and procedures outlined will be applied at the discretion of Crouse Medical Practice
management. As such, Crouse Medical Practice may deviate from the policies, procedures,
benefits and working conditions described in this handbook. The company may also withdraw or
change the policies, procedures, benefits and working conditions described in this handbook at
any time, for any reason. While it is our goal to provide employees with notice of such changes,
prior notice is not required before a change is implemented. Throughout an employee’s
employment with Crouse Medical Practice, it is his or her responsibility to remain up to date on
company policies, procedures, benefits and work conditions—both published and unpublished.

Some of the subjects described here are covered in detail in official benefit policy documents.
You should refer to those documents for specific information since this handbook only briefly
summarizes those benefits. Please note that the terms of the written insurance policies are
controlling.

##### Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity creates Inclusion. Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and
those we serve – regardless of background or position – so that each person can be

we are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences.

 Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team
 Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s
and our community
 Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and
perspectives

##### Employment

##### Americans with Disabilities Act

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or
more employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also
requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who
are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform
the essential job functions of the position.

Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of
individuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate
against qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,
advancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of
employment.

When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided
without creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given
the same consideration for employment as any other applicant.

Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and
employees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the
requested accommodations result in the following:

 A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace
and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or
 An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice.

Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company
ADA policy.

---

The Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including
the resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues.
Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation.

##### Employee Classification

Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as
determined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:

 *Exempt -* Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including
managerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees.

Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or
part-time status.

 *Non-Exempt -* Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards.
Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these
employees.

Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-
time or part-time status.

##### Employment Resignation and Termination

Termination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons
for termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your
anticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, non-
exempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and
exempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice
(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract).

Upon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with
an accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year.

In the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work
force, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off
(PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be
specifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please
refer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014.

If you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will
assume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline
Policy #600-002.

---

##### Employment Status

**FULL-TIME** - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such
full-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service
have been met.

**PART-TIME** - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be part-
time and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who
work on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s
Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other
employee benefits.

**PER DIEM** – Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of
hours. These employees are not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except legally
mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits).

**CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE** – Employees who have a written contract with CMP that defines
the scope of their benefits with the organization.

**TEMPORARY** - Employees engaged to work either part time or full time on Crouse Medical
Practice’s payroll, but have been hired with the understanding that their employment will be
terminated no later than the completion of their specific assignment. This category includes
interns and co-op students. Such employees may be either “exempt” or “non-exempt” but are
not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except benefits except legally mandated
benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits).

##### License and Certification

If your job classification requires licensure or certification, during the initial hiring process, you
must present the original copy of licensure/certification to Human Resources or an online
primary source verification must be completed prior to beginning employment with Crouse
Medical Practice.

Your continued employment in that classification depends on proper maintenance of the
required licensure or certification. It is also your responsibility to notify the New York State
Education Department, Office of Professional Licensure, and/or other relevant
licensing/certification governing bodies, of things such as: name change and change of address
notification (when applicable). This will ensure you receive renewal notices in a timely manner.

Prior to the expiration date, any licensed or certified employee of CMP is responsible for
renewing their license and/or certification in a timely manner. The renewed license
documentation must be provided and/or verified online through a primary source website prior to
the expiration date. If an employee fails to comply with this procedure, they will be unscheduled
from work until it is received and may be subject to disciplinary procedures, up to and possibly
including termination.

---

##### Identification Badge

When you begin working at Crouse Medical Practice, Human Resources will assist you in
getting your photo identification badge. You must wear your ID badge while you’re on CMP and
Crouse Hospital property. The badge must be worn on your upper torso with your first and last
name and photograph visible. You cannot deface the ID badge in any way (this includes placing
unauthorized stickers on the ID badge). All patients have the right to know the name and
function of any person providing healthcare services to them.

If you lose your ID badge or it is stolen or damaged other than in the course of your job, you
must pay a fee to replace it. A replacement badge is available through the Human Resources
Department.

The ID badge is property of the hospital and must be returned to the CMP Human Resources
department upon termination of employment.

##### Employment Verification

All employment verification and reference requests must go through Human Resources.
Authorized Crouse Medical Practice representatives will only provide dates of employment and
job title(s) held while working here. Information related to performance or termination reason
will not be provided.

##### Equal Employment Opportunity

Crouse Medical Practice provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and
applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender, national origin,
age, disability, genetics or reproductive health decision making. In addition to federal law
requirements, Crouse Medical Practice complies with applicable state and local laws governing
nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities. This
policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement,
promotion, termination, layoff, recall, and transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and
training.

Any form of workplace harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, gender, sexual
orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, genetic information, disability,
veteran status or reproductive health decision making is expressly prohibited.

We are committed to a diverse workforce. We value all employees’ talents and support an
environment that is inclusive and respectful. We are strongly committed to this policy and
believe in the concept and spirit of the law.

We believe in and practice equal opportunity. The Human Resources Manager serves as our
Equal Opportunity Coordinator and has overall responsibility for assuring compliance with
CMP’s EEOE Policy #600-006. All employees are responsible for supporting the concept of
equal opportunity and diversity and assisting our Company in meeting its objectives. Employees

---

engaging in any action of discrimination on the basis of any legally protected class or status
recognized by local, state or federal law will be subject to corrective disciplinary action up to and
including termination.

An employee who alleges an employer has violated [New York Labor Law] Section 203-e may
bring a civil action against the employer in any court of competent jurisdiction, which may award
damages, injunctive relief, reinstatement, and/or liquidated damages. Liquidated damages will
equal 100 percent of the damages award unless the employer proves it had a good-faith basis
to believe its actions complied with the law. In addition, separate civil penalties are available if
an employer is found to have engaged in retaliation or retaliatory personnel action against an
employee for exercising rights under Section 203-e.

Please contact Human Resources with questions or concerns.

##### Internal Transfer and/or Promotion

The company strives to retain employees through an environment that creates opportunity and
encourages advancement. It is our goal to allow employees to fully use and develop their skills.

When a position becomes available, it will be advertised both internally and externally. Current
employees are welcome to apply, as are external candidates. All staffing decisions will be made
with the position goals in mind, with the desire to hire the most-qualified individual being
paramount.

At times, positions may be filled internally without being posted. This could relate to a business
need or a planned career progression that includes an employee being assigned new
responsibilities.

In order to be considered for a transfer or promotion, you should contact Human Resources and
express interest in pursuing the opportunity. Details regarding internal transfers can be found in
CMP’s Internal Position Transfer Policy #600-019. After the interview process is complete, if you
are selected for the position, you will receive documentation and the transition process will
begin.

##### I-9 Immigration Reform

The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to hire and retain
only individuals who are authorized to work in the United States.

To enforce these guidelines, IRCA requires an employer to verify a potential employee’s
eligibility by completing the Employment Verification Form (Form I-9). By completing Form I-9,
the employer is certifying that it has viewed documents proving that the potential employee is
authorized to live and work in the United States.

All employees are asked to provide original documents verifying their right to work in the United
States and to sign a verification form (Form I-9). If an individual cannot verify his or her right to

---

work within three (3) days of hire, Crouse Medical Practice must terminate his or her
employment.

Please contact Human Resources with questions or concerns.

##### Unemployment Insurance

Income protection in case of unemployment is provided depending upon your average weekly
earnings as determined under New York State unemployment law qualifications.

##### Workplace Conduct

##### Code of Conduct

Crouse Medical Practice has adopted a Code of Conduct to provide standards and guidance by
which employees, providers, volunteers and other individuals affiliated with Crouse Medical
Practice will conduct themselves (collectively referred to as “Employees”).

The Code of Conduct is a fundamental part of Crouse Medical Practice’s Corporate Compliance
Program, and works together with our Mission, Vision and Value statements and our Corporate
Compliance Policies and Procedures.

CMP’s success as a leading healthcare provider is dependent upon each employee of our
organization - our commitment to personal and professional integrity, our responsibility to act in
good faith, and our obligation to do the right things for the right reasons. All Employees are
expected to protect and promote patients’ rights, quality of care, organization-wide integrity,
ethical business practices and fulfillment of our Mission, Vision and Values.

It is important for all Employees to understand personal obligations to comply with this code,
immediately report any alleged violations of wrongdoing, and assist management and the
Compliance Officer in investigating and/or addressing suspected violations.

The Code does not cover every situation one may encounter, nor does it replace any
organization or department policy or procedure. Instead, the Code contains principles that are
intended to guide Employees in making ethical decisions in carrying out duties for or on behalf
of Crouse Medical Practice. All Employees share in the responsibility to uphold the principles of
caring, honesty and integrity that are fundamental to this Code of Conduct.

Please refer to the full Code of Conduct Policy #100-001, your supervisor or Corporate
Compliance Officer with questions. The Corporate Compliance Officer can be contacted at 315-
766-1612.

##### Conflict Resolution and Employee Complaints

Crouse Medical Practice (CMP) encourages open communication between employees and
management to resolve any employee conflicts. Any concerns employees have should be
promptly reported to management so that a solution may be devised. Some examples of

---

complaints employees may have are suggestions for improvement, concerns about working
conditions, issues with co-workers, or concerns about treatment at work.

When a complaint is voiced, management will do its best to remedy the situation. Every
employee may not be satisfied with every solution; however, employee input is valued and CMP
wants to foster an environment where all employees feel comfortable reporting their concerns.

For more information please see CMP’s Confliction Resolution Policy #600-017.

##### Disciplinary Action

Disciplinary actions may entail verbal, written and final warnings, suspensions and termination.
Not all of these actions may be followed in all instances. Crouse Medical Practice reserves the
right to exercise discretion in discipline. Prior warning is not a requirement for termination. All
disciplinary actions will be documented; documentation will be placed in personnel files.

Crouse Medical Practice reserves the right to take any disciplinary action the company
considers appropriate, including termination, at any time.

For further information, please refer to CMP’s Disciplinary Action Policy #600-013.

##### Drug-free Workplace/Drug and Alcohol Testing

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to and has a vital interest in ensuring a healthful, drug
and alcohol-free workplace that will ensure a safe environment for patients, visitors, and the
community in which we serve. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work
in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their job in a satisfactory manner.

CMP is committed to protecting the safety and well-being of all employees in our workplace. We
recognize that alcohol abuse and drug abuse pose a significant threat to our goals. We have
established a Substance Abuse in the Workplace policy that balances our respect for individuals
with the need to maintain an alcohol- and drug-free environment.

Compliance with this Substance Abuse in the Workplace Policy is a condition of employment.
Please refer to CMP’s Substance Abuse in the Workplace Policy #600-008.

##### False Claims Act and Whistleblower Protections

It is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal
healthcare programs. Crouse Medical Practice is committed to prompt, complete, and accurate
billing of all services provided to individuals. Crouse Medical Practice and its employees,
providers, contractors, and agents shall not make or submit any false or misleading entries on
any claim forms. No employee, provider, contractor, or agent shall engage in any arrangement
or participate in such arrangement at the direction of another person, including any supervisor or
manager that results in the submission of a false or misleading entry on claims forms or
documentation of services that result in the submission of a false claim. Such acts are strictly
prohibited by Crouse Medical Practice and any employee, provider, contractor or agent

---

committing or allowing such acts will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination.

The Federal False Claims Act **(31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733)** & NYS False Claims Act, NY **State**
**Finance Law, Article 13 §§ 187-194** , are Federal & State laws designed to prevent and detect
fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. Under the
Federal and State False Claims Act, anyone who “knowingly” submits a false claim to the
Government is liable for damages up to three times the amount of the erroneous payment plus
Federal or State penalties ranging from no less than $5,000 to $12,000. The amount of damages
may be reduced if the violator self discloses the violation. In addition to the penalties above, any
violation could result in, but not limited to, criminal proceedings.

The law was revised in 1986 to expand the definition of “knowingly” to include a person who:

 Has actual knowledge of falsity of information in the claim;

 Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information in the claim;

 Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information in a claim.

**Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 USC §§ 3801-3812 (PFCRA)** . PFCRA provides for
administrative remedies against any person who knowingly makes a claim or statement that the
person knows or has reason to know is false, fictitious or fraudulent. The presence of a false
claim is not required: a false statement is enough to trigger remedies under PFCRA with civil
penalties up to $5,000 for each such statement and/or claim. This is addition to an assessment
of not more than twice the amount of the claim or portion of.

False Claims suits can be brought against individuals and entities. The False Claims Act does
not require proof of a specific intent to defraud the Government. Entities and individuals can be
prosecuted for a wide variety of conduct that leads to the submission of a false claim.

NYS Laws pertaining to criminal penalties for false claims and statements include NYS Social
Services Law 145 & 366-b, NY Penal Law 155, 175-177, and NY Insurance Law Section 403.
Further detail on these can be found in the CMP Compliance Plan.

Whistleblower or “Qui Tam” Provisions

In order to encourage individuals to come forward and report misconduct involving false claims,
the False Claims Act contains a “Qui Tam” or whistleblower provision. The Government, or an
individual citizen acting on behalf of the Government, can bring actions under the False Claims Act.
An individual citizen, referred to as a whistleblower or “Relator,” who has actual knowledge of
allegedly false claims may file a lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. Government. If the lawsuit is
successful, and provided certain legal requirements are met, the whistleblower may receive an
award ranging from 15% - 30% of the amount recovered.

Employee Protections

The Federal and State False Claims Act and New York State Labor Laws §§ 740 and 741 prohibit
discrimination by Crouse Medical Practice against any employee for reporting suspected
noncompliance in good faith. Any employee who is discharged, demoted, harassed, intimidated,
or otherwise discriminated against because of lawful acts by the employee in False Claims actions

---

is entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Crouse Medical Practice’s
Compliance Program promotes prevention, detection, and resolution of instances of conduct that
do not conform to Federal and State requirements, as well as CMP’s ethical and business policies.

For further information, please refer to our *Compliance Plan, Code of Conduct* and Corporate
Compliance policies and procedures, which include, but are not limited to: *Reporting Compliance*

##### Employee Benefits

##### COBRA Benefits

Crouse Medical Practice complies with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(COBRA). This federal law gives covered employees (and their dependents) who have lost
health benefits the right to continue group health plans for limited periods of time under certain
circumstances (called “qualifying events”). All administrative rules and processes as well as
changes in plan benefits and premiums apply to those on continuation coverage.

Qualifying events for employees that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:

---

 Voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than gross
misconduct
 Reduction in the number of hours of employment

Qualifying events for spouses that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:

 Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee’s employment for any
reason other than gross misconduct
 Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee

Qualifying events for spouses that allow up to 36 months of benefit continuation:

 Covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare
 Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee
 Death of the covered employee

Qualifying events for dependent children that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:

 Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee's employment for any
reason other than gross misconduct
 Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee

Qualifying events for dependent children that allow up to 36 months of benefit continuation:

 Loss of dependent child status under the plan rules
 Covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare
 Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee
 Death of the covered employee

In the event of divorce or legal separation, or the loss of dependent child status under the plan,
a covered employee or dependent must notify Human Resources within 60 days to maintain his
or her COBRA rights. Within 14 days of that notification, Human Resources will provide
enrollment materials to the employee or covered dependent.

The covered employee or dependent has 60 days from either the date that coverage would
ordinarily have ended under the plan due to a qualifying event or the date of notification,
whichever comes later, to elect continuation of coverage. Election of coverage is established by
completing and returning enrollment materials to Human Resources.

COBRA premiums will be billed by the applicable insurance provider. The first premium will be
due within 45 days of the date of election. Subsequent premiums must be received within the
terms set by the provider. Failure to make timely payments will result in termination of coverage
without notice.

Continuation coverage will end after 18 months if the qualifying event was a termination or
reduction in hours, unless the qualified beneficiary is disabled at the time of the qualifying event,

---

in which case coverage may extend to 29 months. For all other qualifying events, continuation
coverage will end after 36 months.

Early termination of COBRA continuation coverage will occur if:

 Crouse Medical Practice discontinues its insurance plan;
 The qualified beneficiary fails to make a premium payment in a timely fashion; or
 The person who elected continuation of coverage becomes covered under another
insurance plan or Medicare.

##### Domestic Partnership

Crouse Medical Practice offers health insurance and other benefits to employees’ domestic
partners and their children, whether those partners are of the same or opposite sex.

In order to qualify as a domestic partner under this policy, an employee will be asked to sign a
statement testifying that he or she lives in an exclusive and mutually committed relationship,
similar to a recognized marriage. In addition, the employee is required to state that both
individuals are:

 18 years of age or older;
 Mutually responsible for each other’s welfare and financial obligations to third parties;
and;
 Not legally married to other people and not related in any way that would prohibit
marriage according to state laws.

To register or terminate a domestic partnership, please contact Human Resources.

##### Employee Assistance Program (EAP)

Crouse Medical Practice recognizes that personal issues can sometimes affect your
performance. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available to employees and their
families to provide confidential help with a wide variety of personal problems, issues and
concerns.

Use of EAP services, however, does not excuse you from complying with company policies and
procedures, or from achieving job requirements or expectations during or after receiving EAP
assistance. Participation in the EAP will not prevent the company from taking disciplinary action
when warranted.

##### Employer-Offered Insurance

Your employment status determines the benefits that you are eligible to receive. If you need a
current copy of your benefits package, please contact Human Resources. This section of the
employee handbook describes the current benefit plans maintained by Crouse Medical Practice.
You should refer to the actual plan documents and summary plan descriptions, which may be
modified from time to time, if you have specific questions regarding a particular benefit. Those

---

documents are controlling, and can be obtained from Human Resources. While it is the intent of
Crouse Medical Practice to continue its current benefit plans, it reserves the right to modify,
amend or terminate, at any time, any benefits currently in effect. Eligible employees are
provided with a comprehensive benefit package that they are able to tailor to accommodate
individual or family needs.

Current benefit options include:

 Medical/Prescription Drug Coverage
 Health Savings Account (HSA)
 Dental
 Vision
 Flexible Spending Plans
 Supplemental Short Term Disability
 Supplemental Long Term Disability
 Life Insurance, Group Term Life Insurance, Supplemental Life Insurance

Employees have 30 days from the start of their employment to enroll in any selected benefits. If
you fail to enroll within this period you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period
unless you experience a life status change.

*Life Status Changes* – Should you experience a life status change, e.g. birth of child, divorce,
marriage, you have up to 30 days to advise Human Resources of the change and provide
documentation. The election change must be on account of and consistent with the Life Status
Change, as described in the Plan. If you fail to provide notification within the 30 days you will
have to wait until the next open enrollment period to make any changes to your existing
coverage(s).

*Open Enrollment* – Each Fall you will have the opportunity to change, add or remove any of
your benefit coverage(s) for an effective date of January 1 of the following calendar year. This
will be the only time that changes will be allowed unless you experience a life status change.

Insurance coverage begins on the first of the month following the date of hire or following
employment status changes which impact benefit eligibility.

You have the option of waiving all pre-tax benefits. Should you choose to waive these benefits,
you will not have another opportunity to elect them until the next Open Enrollment Period. The
only exception to this is in the case of a Life Status Change Event as noted above for an
applicable benefit. Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution elections can be changed at any
time and for any reason. HSA contribution election changes will become effective no later than
the first payroll after the change request is filed.

As a result of termination, a reduction in work hours or in the event that an employee goes on
military leave or takes another extended leave of absence, an employee may be eligible to
continue the organization’s group coverage by paying the monthly premium.

---

Employees are urged to consult the insurance summary plan description for details of the plan
benefits. The plan document controls payment of any benefits.

Enrollment in group insurance is voluntary. There will be no increase in wages if an employee
waives coverage.

For inquiries, contact Human Resources.

##### Employment Taxes & Voluntary Deductions

As an employee of Crouse Medical Practice, you are responsible for paying federal, state and
local taxes. This includes income, Social Security and Medicare taxes. These taxes will be
automatically withdrawn from each of your paychecks at a rate that is determined by the number
of deductions you claim on the W-4 Form.

The employment taxes and voluntary deductions described above will continue to be deducted
from your paycheck until changes are made to the number of deductions you claim, or until you
change your benefit elections. There is a possibility that your contributions for medical and
dental insurance benefits may increase or decrease due to federal or state health insurance
legislations.

##### Tuition Reimbursement

Crouse Medical Practice will provide tuition reimbursement aid to full-time employees who have
been employed for one (1) year. Employees must remain employed with Crouse Medical
Practice for at least one (1) year after the date tuition aid was last granted. Tuition
reimbursement aid will only be granted for courses directly related to the employee’s position.

To apply for Tuition Reimbursement, the employee must complete the Tuition Aid & Remitted
Tuition Application, which can be found in the CMP Policies and Procedures, #600-022. The

##### Workers’ Compensation

Crouse Medical Practice will provide workers’ compensation, a type of accident and injury
insurance that compensates an employee for lost wages, medical expenses and permanent
impairment that results from an injury arising out of or in the course of work. Employees must
report any work-related injury or disease immediately (or as soon as practicable) to their
supervisor and Human Resources so that the necessary paperwork can be completed in a
timely manner. Please note that under state laws, employees who fail to report work-related
injuries in a timely manner may see a reduction or denial of their workers’ compensation
benefits.

If an employee is able to return to work after an injury or illness for which he or she was
receiving workers’ compensation, the employee must provide documentation from his or her
medical provider that either outlines any work-related restrictions or verifies that the employee is
able to complete all job-related tasks. In the event that an employee is able to return to work
under restrictions, the company will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the
employee’s work ability and job responsibilities. If and when the medical provider removes all
work restrictions, the employee is expected to perform his or her regular duties and will no
longer receive workers’ compensation benefits.

FMLA leave and workers’ compensation leave will be applied concurrently when possible.

##### Time Away From Work

##### Bereavement Leave

Crouse Medical Practice has taken into consideration the personal needs that arise from the
death of an immediate family member. In the event of such a loss:

 An employee will be allowed up to five (5) days of leave with full pay until and including
the day of the funeral in the event of a loss of a spouse or domestic partner and children
(to include step-children).
 An employee will be allowed up to three (3) days of leave with full pay until and including
the day of the funeral in the event of the loss of a father, mother, sister, brother, mother-
in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparent, grandchild or any relative
who lives with the employee.
 An employee will be allowed up to one (1) day of leave with full pay until and including
the day of the funeral in the event of the loss of an aunt, uncle, niece, nephew and
cousin; including in-laws.

Bereavement leave will not count against accrued paid time off (PTO). Bereavement leave pay
will not be granted to employees during periods when they are not at work due to an approved
leave of absence.

---

Employees should notify their supervisor of the need to use bereavement leave. Within a
reasonable period of time, the employee may be required to provide verification of need, such
as an obituary.

##### Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

As an employee of Crouse Medical Practice, you may be eligible to take unpaid family and
medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Eligible employees may take up to a
total of 12 weeks of job-protected FMLA leave within a rolling 12-month period, measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. If you have questions regarding
FMLA, please contact Human Resources.

Eligibility

To be eligible for leave, you must have been employed by the Organization for at least months. In the 12 months immediately preceding the beginning of the leave, you must also have
worked at least 1,250 hours to qualify for federal FMLA.

FMLA may be requested for any combination of the following reasons:

 The birth of an employee’s newborn child or the placement of a child with the employee
for adoption or foster care
 To care for the employee’s spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition
 The employee has a serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform
the functions of their job
 A qualifying exigency that arises because the employee’s spouse, child or parent is a
covered military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending
call or order to covered active duty)
 To care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the employee is
the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the service member (military
caregiver leave) (26 weeks)

Such leaves may be taken all at once or, when medically necessary, intermittently or on a
reduced leave schedule. The need for leave must be documented by your treating health care
provider through our medical certification process. In the case where the leave is for an
employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness-for-duty statement will be required in order
for you to return from a medical leave. Failure to provide the statement will result in a delay in
your return to work. If an employee is provided group health insurance, the employee is entitled
to the continuation of the group health insurance coverage during FMLA leave on the same
terms as if he or she had continued to work. If family member coverage is provided to an
employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. The employee
must continue to make any normal contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums.

Please contact Human Resources for additional information.

##### NYS Disability Insurance

In accordance with New York State law, eligible employees are able to file for Statutory
Disability Insurance for partial income protection if you are out of work for a medical reason for a

NYS Disability leave will be applied when possible.

##### Lunch and Rest Periods

Employees are required to take an unpaid thirty (30) minute lunch break. Lunch breaks are
generally taken between the hours of 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM. The schedule for meal periods
should be established based on work requirements in each office. Staggered meal periods may
be necessary to ensure the continuity of operations and services. Supervisors should make sure
that each location is adequately staffed and that someone with authority to resolve minor
problems is available at all times.

You may be allowed one paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes each day. The availability and
schedule for this break is at the discretion of management and depend on the needs of each
office.

##### Jury Duty

Upon completion of their probationary period, full-time employees who provide Crouse Medical
Practice with their notice to serve as a juror and with the court’s certification of time spent for
jury service including necessary reporting for jury service procedures, will be paid the difference
between the jury duty fee and their straight time hourly rate or regular salary when serving as a
juror during their scheduled work hours.

Part-time employees will be paid a pro-rated amount based on their vouchered status and
straight time hourly rate when serving as a juror during their scheduled work hours, subject to
the same conditions specified above for full-time employees.

Jury absence will be noted on your time sheet or time card. Time spent on jury duty will not be
counted as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay.

---

This benefit cannot be applied to any court appearance.

Questions regarding the Company’s jury duty leave policy should be directed to Human
Resources.

##### Military Leave

Crouse Medical Practice provides military leave to eligible employees in compliance with federal
and state laws, including the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act (USERRA). Questions regarding military leave should be directed to Human
Resources.

Employees should notify their managers as soon as they become aware of a military service
obligation.

##### Nursing Mothers

As part of our family-friendly policies and benefits, Crouse Medical Practice accommodates
mothers who wish to express breast milk during the workday when separated from their
newborn child.

For up to three (3) years after the child’s birth, nursing employees will be provided with
reasonable break time to express breast milk during the workday. Nursing mothers who are
returning from maternity leave should speak with their managers or supervisors regarding their
needs. Supervisors will work with employees to develop a break schedule that is reasonable,
accounts for needs that may vary from day to day, and creates the least amount of disruption to
the organizations operations.

Crouse Medical Practice will provide a private area, other than a bathroom, for nursing
employees to express breast milk. Nursing mothers must request/reserve the room by
contacting their direct supervisor.

Breaks to express milk will not be paid. In addition to these breaks to express milk, employees
may use normal break and lunch periods to accommodate additional nursing needs.

For more information, see policy #600-023. If you have any further questions or concerns
regarding this policy, please contact Human Resources.

##### Paid Family Leave (PFL)

Effective January 1 ^st^ , 2018, Crouse Medical Practice (CMP) provides Paid Family Leave (PFL)
to eligible employees pursuant to the New York Paid Family Leave Benefits Law.

PFL is available for eligible employees to take paid time off from work for the
following purposes:

 to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child;

---

 to care for a covered family member (including spouses, domestic partners,
children, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren) with a
serious health condition; or
 to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active
military duty.

For further information please refer to CMP’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020.

##### Paid Time Off (PTO)

Crouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away
from work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)
program to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to
decide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule.

Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:

 As vacation
 For personal business
 For periods of illness
 For religious observation
 For doctor or dental appointments
 For personal or family emergencies
 In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions

##### Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual

All full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO
hours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total
amount of PTO time in two equally divided “buckets” to current employees in the beginning of
the first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year.

Time allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. – the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):

 Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the
employee’s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the
completion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires.
 Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an
exempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If
they work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the
month following the date of hire for new hires.

When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to
determine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or
with less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees

---

may roll up to forty (40) hours of PTO from one calendar year to the next unless otherwise
specified in an employment contract or offer letter.

Unless specified otherwise in an employment agreement or offer letter, PTO time is earned as
outlined in CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014.

##### Personal Leave

Crouse Medical Practice complies with all federal and state leave laws. However, when these
laws do not apply or an employee does not meet the eligibility requirements, the company will
consider an employee’s request for a personal leave.

##### Time Off to Vote

Crouse Medical Practice encourages all employees to vote. It is the policy of Crouse Medical
Practice to comply with all state election laws with respect to providing employees time off to
vote.

If an employee has four consecutive hours, either between the opening of the polls in his or her
community and the beginning of the workday or between the end of the workday and the closing
of the polls, it will be deemed that the employee has sufficient time outside his or her normal
working hours in which to vote.

If an employee has less than four consecutive hours in the time periods described above, he or
she may take up to two (2) hours of working time to vote. This time is eligible as paid voting
leave, and such time shall be taken only at the beginning or end of the employee’s workday as
designated by his or her supervisor.

Employees requiring working time off to vote will be required to notify their employers at least
two to 10 working days before the day of the election.

Time off to vote is paid and does not count against an employee’s accrued Paid Time Off
(PTO). Questions should be directed to Human Resources.

##### Driving While on Company Business

Employees who drive for company business must have a current, valid driver’s license and
required insurance.

---

As a driver, your first responsibility is to pay attention to the road. Distracted driving plays a role
in many motor vehicle accidents. We are not only concerned about your welfare as a Crouse
Medical Practice employee, but also the welfare of others who could be put in harm’s way.

When driving on Crouse Medical Practice business or driving while conducting business on
behalf of the company in any other capacity, the following applies:

 Cellular phone use while driving is a common, often harmful, distraction. For this reason,
while on company business we require you to follow New York state law and use a
hands-free device.
 Crouse Medical Practice is not responsible for any moving traffic violations, tickets for
parking violations or violation of any other city ordinances or state or federal laws
regarding your driving habits and operation and care of your personal motor vehicle. Any
tickets issued are the employee’s responsibility, even if the ticket is issued while
conducting business for Crouse Medical Practice.
 Use your best judgment when road conditions are poor. Limit or avoid driving when rain
or snow threatens your safety.
 Make an effort to avoid distractions while driving.
 There should be no texting while driving per New York state law.
 Do not drive if your ability to drive safely is impaired by the influence of medications. As
an organization against drunk driving; be a responsible driver. Abide by the law and use
a designated driver if you are under the influence of alcohol.

##### Employee Fraternization

Crouse Medical Practice wants to preserve a working environment that has clear boundaries
between personal and professional relationships. This is believed to be the best practice for
conducting business in a professional manner. This policy establishes clear boundaries with
regard to how relationships develop at work and within the confines of the work area.

 During working hours and in work areas, employees of Crouse Medical Practice are
expected to keep all personal interactions limited and at a professional level to avoid
distracting or offending others.
 Employees are prohibited from engaging in any physical interactions that would be seen
as inappropriate in the work area. What constitutes inappropriate conduct is in the
discretion of CMP.
 Employees who engage in personal relationships with others and allow these
relationships to negatively affect the working environment will be subject to disciplinary
action. If said employees fail to change their behavior after disciplinary action takes
place, they may be subject to termination.
 Romantic relationships between supervising, managing or executive employees and
subordinates are strictly prohibited. If a relationship does develop between a supervising
employee and his or her subordinate, management should be notified immediately so
that a transfer may be considered.

##### Employee Referral Bonus

A bonus program has been established to encourage our present employees to refer quality
candidates to our organization. If the referred candidate is hired, the employee who submitted
the referral will receive a bonus. In order to qualify for this program, a current employee should
provide the referral for a posted position. Following are the guidelines to this program:

 Referred candidate cannot already have been recommended through a recruiter.
 Referred candidate is required to complete the Employee Referral Bonus Form at the
time of new hire orientation.
 Referral Bonus will be paid in two installments; the first upon the successful completion
of three (3) months worked, the second after the completion of six (6) months worked.
Both the new employee and the individual who made the recommendation must be
active employees at the time the bonuses are due in order for payment to be processed.
 This bonus option does not apply to anyone who has a recruitment, hiring or supervisory
role.

Please contact Human Resources for further information.

##### Employment of Relatives
Members of your immediate family will be considered for employment on the basis of their
qualifications. Your immediate family may not be hired, however, if it would:

 Create a direct supervisor-subordinate relationship with a family member
 Have the potential for creating an adverse effect on work performance
 Create either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest

This policy must be considered when hiring, assigning or promoting an employee.

---

If a circumstance arises that results in a direct supervisory relationship between immediate
family or close personal relatives (including marriage, reduction in force, reorganization, priority
placement, etc.), one of the relatives may be reassigned to an appropriate vacancy.

Questions should be directed to Human Resources.

##### Incident/Accident Reporting (Safety)

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to establishing and maintaining a comfortable and safe
working environment for all employees, patients, and guests.

Safety is often taken for granted, however, we must recognize that safety risks are present and
take steps to reduce the risk of injury or illness. The company will comply with applicable safety
laws. In order to guarantee that accidents are avoided whenever possible, we expect our
employees to refrain from horseplay, careless behavior and negligent actions. Safety is
everyone’s responsibility.

If you, a patient, or guest, are involved in an accident, you must:

 Report the accident to your supervisor or to Human Resources immediately
 Obtain any necessary medical treatment
 Fill out an Incident/Accident Report, regardless of the severity of the injury
 If seeking medical treatment, obtain approval to leave the premises from your supervisor

Employees who fail to comply with these procedures may be subject to disciplinary action.

##### Inclement Weather

Unless you are informed otherwise, always assume that Crouse Medical Practice is open for
business during normal hours. Use common sense and your best judgment, however, when
traveling to work in severe weather.

Generally severe weather would be in the form of a blizzard; with the possibility of extreme
thunderstorms/tornadoes.

If the company is not going to open for the day, you will receive notice from your supervisor
and/or the information will appear on the company’s website and posted on local news outlets. If
this happens, you will be compensated per CMP’s Inclement Weather policy.

When potentially dangerous weather develops during the day a decision to close will be made
by the President and/or Executive Director.

For specific details, please refer to CMP’s Inclement Weather policy #600-010.

##### Media Relations

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to providing the media with accurate information. To
avoid discrepancies, specific guidelines should be followed when a media inquiry is received.

---

All media inquiries regarding the company and its operation must be immediately referred to
Crouse Health’s Office of Communications and Government Affairs, who is authorized to make
or approve public statements regarding the organization. Unless specifically designated by this
person, employees are not authorized to make any statements. If you wish to write or publish an
article, paper or other publication on behalf of the company, you must first obtain approval.

Media inquiries include, but are not limited to, official statements, press releases and
advertisements.

Please contact CMP Administration with any questions or concerns you have regarding Media
Relations.

##### Online Social Networking

current patients’ trust, gaining new patients, retaining first-class employees, recruiting new
employees and marketing our services.

Please refer to CMP’s Social Media Policy #600-005 for further details.

##### Open Door Policy

The organization fosters an “Open Door Policy” - an environment where employees and
management feel comfortable communicating with and voicing concerns to one another.
Basically, this means that all of the managers’ doors are open to all of the employees, and
employees are free to talk with management at any time. Please consider the following in
regard to this:

You are responsible for addressing concerns with a manager, from complaints to suggestions
and observations. Addressing these concerns allows the company to improve and explain
practices, processes and decisions.

We recommend that you first discuss concerns with your immediate supervisor, but the “Open
Door Policy” also gives you the option of discussing them with higher management and/or
Human Resources. All of these parties are willing to listen to the issue and assist in a resolution.

##### O  rientation Period

For all employees hired by Crouse Medical Practice, you must attend general orientation at
Crouse Medical Practice Administration located at 739 Irving Avenue. Attendance at orientation
is mandatory prior to commencement of employment. This is a requirement of the employment
process and will include review of CMP’s organizational structure, completion of employment
paperwork, HIPAA, compliance and OSHA policies and procedures.

Upon completion of general orientation, the first ninety (90) days of employment are considered
an orientation period. During this time, the employee will undergo training and orientation as

---

directed by the employee’s supervisor. The employee’s supervisor will also monitor the
employee’s performance during this time.

During the first 90 days of employment, the employee is encouraged and expected to ask
questions concerning his or her job responsibilities, and to determine if he or she is satisfied
with the position. If the employee’s job performance is found to be unsatisfactory by his or her
supervisor at any time during the first 90 days of employment, the orientation period may be
extended or employment may be terminated.

All new employees will receive a confidential performance evaluation from their supervisor at
the end of the orientation period.

##### Recording Working Time

Each shift, non-exempt (hourly) employees are required to record their work time by accessing
the Time & Attendance system via the computer. It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure
that your time is correctly recorded (i.e. by punching in and out of your shifts, every day).
Detailed instructions will be given to you by your supervisor.

Failure to properly record your work time may be subject to disciplinary procedures, up to and
possibly including termination.

##### Overtime Pay

Crouse Medical Practice must compensate all hourly, non-exempt employees one-and-a-half
times their hourly wage rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours each week. PTO and
Company Holidays do not count towards the calculation of overtime.

The company’s workweek begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

At times, employees will be asked to work overtime to complete necessary work tasks. The
employee’s supervisor will notify the employee as early as possible regarding scheduling needs.

Employees who want to work more than 40 hours during a workweek must receive authorization
from their supervisor before working overtime.

##### Pay Periods and Check Distribution/Direct Deposit Voucher

The standard pay period at Crouse Medical Practice consists of two (2), 7-day, 40 hour weeks
and starts on a Sunday and ends on the second following Saturday. Employees will be paid on
a bi-weekly basis on Friday. If paydays fall on non-workdays or holidays, employees will be paid
on the last workday prior to the regularly scheduled payday.

It is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to offer employee’s the option to receive payments via
electronic direct deposit and/or live payroll check. The payroll office or Human Resources will
assist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any
questions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit.

---

Crouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for
employees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will
be electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated
by each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or
credit unions that support direct deposit.

It is each employee’s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal
information and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has
been an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not
entitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid
amounts from future paychecks.

Paychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be
released to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the
employee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on
the date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or
she returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day.

If an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to
payroll information through the Company’s payroll service provider.

##### Performance Evaluation

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,
about your job performance. Managers and supervisors are responsible for providing ongoing
performance feedback to each employee. In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally
discuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may
be conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position.

Your performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas
needing improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance
problems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal
discussions or formal disciplinary action. Formal performance feedback becomes a permanent
part of your personnel file. Please contact Human Resources if you have any questions.

business. There are important things to consider when using company phones. Please adhere

telephone communication extremely important. A friendly but professional telephone
manner should always be projected.
 *Personal phone calls* - We recognize that periodically, personal phone calls must be
made or received during the business hours. Such calls should be held at a minimum so
that they do not interfere with the workflow. Additionally, these calls should be made
outside of any patient care or public area.

for personal calls, text messaging, surfing the Internet, receiving or responding to email,
checking phone messages or any other purpose during business hours. Please inform
family and friends that your cell phone will be unavailable during work hours. If there is
an emergency family/friends should attempt to reach you by calling the office first.
***Cell phone calls are permitted during lunch or break times in the breakroom or***
***outdoors, or in a private office, but not in the general office areas.***
 *Voicemail* – Many company telephones are also equipped with voicemail. Voicemail was
installed to help maintain our high quality of service for patients and to increase
efficiency throughout the office. Please be sure to check your voicemail regularly and
respond appropriately to inquiries left via voicemail. In advance of planned absences
(PTO days), an outgoing out-of-office message should be recorded to inform callers who
to reach in your absence and/or your return date.
