employment at-will relationship. This Handbook does not limit management’s discretion to make personnel
decisions such as reassignment, change of wages and benefits, demotion etc.

Confidentiality
The Company maintains a personnel file and payroll records for each employee as required by law. Personnel
files and payroll records are the property of the Company and may not be removed from the Company premises
without written authorization. Because personnel files and payroll records are confidential, access to the records
is restricted. Generally, only those who have a legitimate reason to review information in an employee’s file are
allowed to do so.

Disclosure of personnel information such as employees contact information, work schedule, and status of
employment is strictly prohibited by anyone at the company other than managers. However, the Company will
cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or other federal agencies conducting
official investigations and otherwise legally required.

held with the Company and eligibility for rehire, if asked. Compensation information may also be verified if
written authorization is provided by the employee.

CODE OF CONDUCT
Disciplinary Procedure
As an at-will employer, the Company may impose discipline whenever it determines it is necessary or
appropriate. Discipline may take various forms, including verbal counseling, written warnings, suspension,
demotion, transfer, reassignment or termination. The discipline imposed will depend on the circumstances of
each case; therefore, discipline will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover, at any
time the Company determines it is appropriate, an employee may be discharged immediately.

Every organization must have certain standards of conduct to guide the behavior of employees. Although there
is no possible way to identify every rule of conduct, the following is an illustrative list (not intended to be
comprehensive or to limit the Company’s right to impose discipline for any other conduct it deems
inappropriate). Keep in mind that these standards of conduct apply to all employees whenever they are on
Company property and/or conducting Company business (on or off Company property). Engaging in any conduct
the Company deems inappropriate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Company to do so, the Company has voluntarily chosen to pay overtime to its exempt employees, as well.

You have been hired by the Company to perform work under the expectation of adaptability to a fluctuating
schedule. In such cases in which you must complete tasks to meet project deadlines you may be requested to
work overtime. Refusal to work overtime is considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary actions up
to and including termination.

Rest and Meal Periods
All rest and meal periods will be in accordance with state and federal law.

To the extent the law does not require rest and meal breaks, field employees will be provided a 15-minute paid
rest break in the morning and an additional in the evening — assuming the employee is working a full shift. Field
employees scheduled to work more than a five hour period will be provided a 30-minute unpaid meal period.
Meal breaks and/or rest breaks must be taken only when approved by a manager or shift leader to avoid
disturbance on site.

Time Keeping

All employees are required to sign-in on the CRAS and/or client preferred sign-in sheet when they arrive on site
and sign-out upon their departure from work. Employees are not allowed to sign-in more than 5 minutes before
scheduled shift and 15 minutes after their scheduled shift without manager approval. Time cards are official
business records and may not be altered without the employee’s supervisor’s approval and may not be falsified
in any way. Failure to abide within these standards set forth may lead to disciplinary action up to and including
termination.

Payroll Deductions

Various payroll deductions are made each pay period to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes
and insurance. Deductions will be made for the following: Federal and State Income Tax Withholding, Social
Security, Medicare, State Disability and Family Temporary Disability Insurance, Employee portion health
insurance premium as chosen upon hire date, any Company provided advances (payday advance and/or hotel
direct advances) and other items by you or required by law (including a valid court order). You can adjust your
federal and state income tax withholding by completing the proper federal or state form and submitting to a
member of the CRAS corporate office. At the start of each calendar year, you will be supplied with your Wage
and Tax Statement (W-2) form for the prior year. This statement summarizes your income and deductions for
the year.

Wage Garnishment
A garnishment is a court order requiring an employer to remit part of an employee’s wages to a third party to
satisfy a just debt. Once the Company receives the legal papers ordering a garnishment, we are required by law
to continue making deductions from your check until we have withheld the full amount or until we receive legal
papers from the court to stop the garnishment. Even if you have already paid the debt, we still need the legal
papers to stop the garnishment.

Direct Deposit
All employees are encouraged, but not required, to utilize the option of funds deposited into a bank account of
an accredited participating bank or credit union of their choosing. If you would prefer to enroll a Company
provided Sole Pay card you have the ability to do so as well. It is the employees responsibility to ensure a
member of the CRAS corporate office is made aware of where you wish you pay card to be mailed to within a
timely manner, failure to do so will lead to delays in receipt of pay card.

Workers Compensation Leave
Any employee who is unable to work related to injury or illness and who is eligible for Worker’s Compensation
benefits will be provided an unpaid leave for the period required. The first 12 weeks will be treated concurrently
as a family and medical leave under the federal Family Medical Leave Act for eligible employees.

Jury Duty
U.S. citizens have a civic obligation to provide jury duty service when called.

The employee must bring in the jury duty notice as soon as it is received so that appropriate arrangements can
be made to cover his or her duties. Employees are required to call in or report for work on those days or parts of
days when their presence in court is not required. Should you be urgently needed, the Company may request a
postponement of jury services until some future date.

You may be required to submit some proof of jury service, such as pay stubs upon returning to work. The
Company is not required to pay field employees for Jury Duty.
