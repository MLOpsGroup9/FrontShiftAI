in this Handbook and to deviate them when, in its discretion, it determines it is appropriate.

add to any and all policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this handbook or in any other
document, except for the policy of at-will employment as described below. Nothing in this employee handbook

time to time, benefits may be added or deleted from the benefits package. The Company reserves the right to
make such changes.

This handbook does not contain the complete terms and/or conditions of any of the Company’s current benefit
plans. It is intended only to provide general explanations. For information regarding employee benefits and
services, employees should contact a member of the CRAS team.

**Worker’s Compensation**
All states have worker’s compensation laws whose purpose is to promote the general welfare of people by
providing compensation for accidental injuries or death suffered in the course of employment. These laws are
designed to provide protection to workers suffering occupational disabilities through accidents arising out of,
and in the course of employment. Construction Recruiters America Staffing, Inc. carries worker’s compensation
insurance for all employees and pays the entire cost of the insurance program. An employee who suffers an
injury or illness in connection with the job is usually eligible to receive a portion of your salary up to maximum
set by the state until you are able to return to work and in addition may be entitled to receive payment for all
reasonable medical expenses. The state may limit the number of weeks you are able to draw benefits as well as
the total you are able to draw.
If you believe you have suffered an on-the-job injury or illness, you must report this incident immediately as
required in accordance to the Company’s Accident Reporting Procedure as well as submission of a post-accident
drug and alcohol test. Failure to comply within Company reporting procedure may jeopardize your ability to
qualify for compensation.

During your employment, you and the Company both contribute funds to the Federal government to support
the Social Security Program. This program is intended to provide you with retirement benefit payments and
medical coverage once you reach retirement age.

**Unemployment Insurance**
The Company pays a state and federal tax to provide employees with unemployment insurance coverage in the
event they become unemployed through no fault of their own due to circumstance described by law. This
insurance is administered by applicable state agencies, who determine eligibility for benefits, the amount of
benefits (if any), and duration of benefits.

---

**Pay Periods and Paydays**
Employees are paid on a weekly basis. Payday is every Friday. Pay period ends on Sunday, and pay is dispersed
via pay card or direct deposit of your choosing. In the event payday falls on a holiday, the payday will be
observed on the preceding business day. Any changes required as applicable to funds distribution must be
received one week prior to effective date of change and the notification must be submitted in writing inclusive
of proper documentation from your bank as well.

**Overtime Pay**
Regular employees will be paid in accordance with federal and state law.

The Fair Labor Standards Act provides that all non-exempt employees are eligible to receive overtime pay for all
time worked over forty (40) hours in any one work week and in the state of California to receive overtime pay
for all time worked over eight (8) hours per day in any one work week. Although the FLSA does not require the
Company to do so, the Company has voluntarily chosen to pay overtime to its exempt employees, as well.

You have been hired by the Company to perform work under the expectation of adaptability to a fluctuating
schedule. In such cases in which you must complete tasks to meet project deadlines you may be requested to
work overtime. Refusal to work overtime is considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary actions up
to and including termination.

**Rest and Meal Periods**
All rest and meal periods will be in accordance with state and federal law.

To the extent the law does not require rest and meal breaks, field employees will be provided a 15-minute paid
rest break in the morning and an additional in the evening – assuming the employee is working a full shift. Field
employees scheduled to work more than a five hour period will be provided a 30-minute unpaid meal period.
Meal breaks and/or rest breaks must be taken only when approved by a manager or shift leader to avoid
disturbance on site.

**Time Keeping**
All employees are required to sign-in on the CRAS and/or client preferred sign-in sheet when they arrive on site
and sign-out upon their departure from work. Employees are not allowed to sign-in more than 5 minutes before
scheduled shift and 15 minutes after their scheduled shift without manager approval. Time cards are official
business records and may not be altered without the employee’s supervisor’s approval and may not be falsified
in any way. Failure to abide within these standards set forth may lead to disciplinary action up to and including
termination.

**Payroll Deductions**
Various payroll deductions are made each pay period to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes
and insurance. Deductions will be made for the following: Federal and State Income Tax Withholding, Social
Security, Medicare, State Disability and Family Temporary Disability Insurance, Employee portion health
insurance premium as chosen upon hire date, any Company provided advances (payday advance and/or hotel
direct advances) and other items by you or required by law (including a valid court order). You can adjust your
federal and state income tax withholding by completing the proper federal or state form and submitting to a
member of the CRAS corporate office. At the start of each calendar year, you will be supplied with your Wage
and Tax Statement (W-2) form for the prior year. This statement summarizes your income and deductions for
the year.

---

**Wage Garnishment**
A garnishment is a court order requiring an employer to remit part of an employee’s wages to a third party to
satisfy a just debt. Once the Company receives the legal papers ordering a garnishment, we are required by law
to continue making deductions from your check until we have withheld the full amount or until we receive legal
papers from the court to stop the garnishment. Even if you have already paid the debt, we still need the legal
papers to stop the garnishment.

**Direct Deposit**
All employees are encouraged, but not required, to utilize the option of funds deposited into a bank account of
an accredited participating bank or credit union of their choosing. If you would prefer to enroll a Company
provided Sole Pay card you have the ability to do so as well. It is the employees responsibility to ensure a
member of the CRAS corporate office is made aware of where you wish you pay card to be mailed to within a
timely manner, failure to do so will lead to delays in receipt of pay card.

**Workers Compensation Leave**
Any employee who is unable to work related to injury or illness and who is eligible for Worker’s Compensation
benefits will be provided an unpaid leave for the period required. The first 12 weeks will be treated concurrently
as a family and medical leave under the federal Family Medical Leave Act for eligible employees.

**Jury Duty**
U.S. citizens have a civic obligation to provide jury duty service when called.

The employee must bring in the jury duty notice as soon as it is received so that appropriate arrangements can
be made to cover his or her duties. Employees are required to call in or report for work on those days or parts of
days when their presence in court is not required. Should you be urgently needed, the Company may request a
postponement of jury services until some future date.

You may be required to submit some proof of jury service, such as pay stubs upon returning to work. The
Company is not required to pay field employees for Jury Duty.
