###### About Home Bank
Home Bank (Home Bank, N.A.) was chartered in 1908 as Home Building and Loan. Today, it is one of
the nation's most stable ﬁnancial institutions, building on the future by doing what's right for our
customers today. Personal banking has always been our trademark. That tradition continues as we
move forward with innovative banking options and new technology for our customers. With locations
across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, we're driving the economy, expanding opportunities and
preparing for the future.

Over the past century, Home Bank has always gone above and beyond, striving to be good for
business and good for life. We are the ﬁnancial support of many thriving, independently owned local
corporations and developments. We also maintain a personal banking atmosphere that allows
customers to feel comfortable entrusting their ﬁnancial well-being to us. By continuing to oﬀer great
products and exceptional service, our goal is to be the only bank our customers will ever need.

###### You Can Bank on Our Values
Home Bank has always been a values-led company. It was founded that way and our decisions over
the years have always been anchored in our core values. We have formalized those values so that,
as we grow, every one of our employees understands that both our character and decision making
come from this set of established beliefs and actions.

###### Employment at Will
Employment at Home Bank is on an at-will basis. This means that either you or Home Bank may
terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or notice.
Nothing in this employee handbook or any other document or statement is intended to or creates an
employment agreement, express or implied, that is contrary to the at-will nature of employment. No
supervisor or other representative of Home Bank except the Chief Executive Oﬃcer (in a written
document) has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any speciﬁed period of
time, or to make any agreement contrary to this information, and any such agreement must be
signed by both the Chief Executive Oﬃcer and the employee.

###### Our Commitment to Diversity
Home Bank strives to create and maintain a workplace in which all employees have an opportunity
to participate and contribute to the success of the business and are valued for their skills,
experience, and unique perspectives. This commitment is embodied in our values and the way we
do business at Home Bank. At Home Bank, we do the right thing.

We are invested.
*We’re on it, we own it.*

We share our ideas & insights.
*Because that makes us all better.*

###### Equal Opportunity
Home Bank is committed to providing equal employment opportunity to all qualiﬁed persons based
on personal capabilities and qualiﬁcations without regard to sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and
related medical conditions), race, color, religion, ancestry, gender, gender identity, gender
expression, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship, age, sexual orientation, genetic information,
disability, military or veteran status, or any other characteristic as established and protected by
applicable law; and to taking aﬃrmative action to ensure that minorities, veterans, and women are
encouraged to seek employment with the Bank. This policy of equal employment opportunity
applies to all policies and procedures relating to recruitment and hiring, compensation and beneﬁts,
training, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoﬀ, termination, and all other terms and conditions of
employment.

Employees and applicants will not be subjected to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion,
retaliation, or discrimination because they have engaged in or may engage in (1) ﬁling a complaint;
(2) assisting in ﬁling a complaint; (3) assisting or participating in an investigation, compliance review,
hearing or any other activity related to the administration of Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Vietnam Era Veteran’s Readjustment Act of 1974, or any other
federal, state or local law requiring equal employment opportunity, and/or (4) exercising any other
right protected by the aforementioned laws.

The Human Resources Director coordinates, internal audits and monitors the Bank’s Aﬃrmative
Action Plan. This Aﬃrmative Action Plan applies equally to all employees of Home Bank. The
Aﬃrmative Action Plan for Individuals with Disabilities and for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the
Vietnam Era are available for review by employees by contacting HR. All employees and all levels of
management should provide their assistance and support to this policy to ensure complete
compliance.

###### Anti-harassment & Discrimination
Home Bank is committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination, harassment, bully-
ing, disrespectful or other unprofessional conduct by or toward an employee, those in a managerial
or leadership role, or third party (customers, vendors, contractors, etc.) for any reason, including, but
not limited to:

- Race
- Religion
- Color
- Sex/gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions); gender identity orexpression; and sexual orientation

- National origin
- Ancestry
- Physical or mental disability
- Genetic information/characteristics
- Age
- Military or veteran status
- Any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation

---

Home Bank also prohibits discrimination, harassment, bullying, disrespectful or unprofessional
conduct based on the perception that anyone has any of these characteristics, or is associated with
a person who has or is perceived as having any of these characteristics.

The conduct prohibited by this policy includes conduct in any form, whether verbal, non-verbal,
visual, written, or physical. This includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, voice mail, Internet activity, text
messages, pictures, images, objects, writings, words, gestures, or physical contact.

In general, discrimination and harassment can be deﬁned as conduct that disparages or shows
hostility or aversion toward a protected status. It can take many forms, including: epithets or slurs;
threats; derogatory names, comments, objects or visual depictions; jokes or teasing; and other
verbal, nonverbal, written, visual or physical conduct that is based on a protected status.
Sexual harassment in particular can include a range of subtle or blatant behaviors and may involve
individuals of the same or diﬀerent gender. It can be generally deﬁned as: unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or conduct of a sexual nature including, but not limited to,
sexually-related images, jokes, teasing, uninvited touching or other sexually-related conduct when:

- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of anindividual's employment;

- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis foremployment decisions aﬀecting such individual; or

- such conduct has the purpose or eﬀect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's workperformance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or oﬀensive working environment.

Sexual harassment does not need to be motivated by sexual desire to be unlawful or to violate this
policy. For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of their gender, gender identity or
expression, or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment, regardless of whether the
treatment is motivated by sexual desire.

Additional examples of sexual harassment include:

- Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:o Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another
employee’s body or poking another employee’s body;
o Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults.

- Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:o Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target’s
job performance evaluation, a promotion or other job beneﬁts or detriments;
o Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities.

- Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or comments about a person’s sexuality orsexual experience, which create a hostile work environment.

- Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered inappropriate simplybecause they may not conform to other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a
particular sex should act or look.

*The key symbolizes ownership and trust. As a Home Bank*
*team member, you are entrusted with representing us well.*

---

- Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual’s sex, sexual orientation,gender identity or the status of being transgender, such as:
o Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person’s workstation, tools or equipment, or
otherwise interfering with the individual’s ability to perform the job;
o Sabotaging an individual’s work;
o Bullying, yelling, name-calling.

Harassment, whether sexual or based on another protected status, is not limited to the physical
workplace itself. It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at bank-sponsored
events. Calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees can also constitute workplace
harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace, on personal devices, or during
non-working hours.

Those in supervisory or leadership positions are expected to have a high level of consciousness
regarding this policy and must promptly advise Human Resources of any potential incidents of
harassment or discrimination. Speciﬁcally, with respect to sexual harassment, no supervisor,
manager, or oﬃcer shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that any individual’s
submission to or rejection of sexual advances will in any way inﬂuence any personnel decisions
regarding that person’s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or
any other term or condition of employment.

Individuals must remain mindful that when conduct that may violate this policy occurs, it is not the
intent of the person(s) engaging in the conduct that matters. Rather, it is the nature of the conduct,
how that conduct is perceived, and the impact that conduct has on others that matters.

A victim of discrimination, harassment or other similar conduct does not have to be the intended
recipient of the behavior. It can be anyone who ﬁnds the behavior oﬀensive and feels aﬀected by
such behavior. If you believe you have been subject to conduct prohibited by this policy or become
aware of such conduct, you should report the situation immediately to your supervisor, Human
Resources, or any member of management with whom you feel comfortable. This applies whether
the party involved is an employee, someone in management, a customer, a vendor, or any member
of the public with whom you come in contact as part of your employment. Anyone witnessing or
receiving a report about possible harassment must report the situation to Human Resources
immediately.

Home Bank will investigate all reports promptly and fairly and in accordance with any legal
requirements. While the Bank will maintain conﬁdentiality to the extent possible, complete
conﬁdentiality cannot be guaranteed, as the duty to investigate and take appropriate action may
require the disclosure of information to individuals with a need to know.

If Home Bank determines that discrimination, harassment, or other prohibited conduct has occurred,
appropriate action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees should also know that if they engage
in unlawful harassment, they can be held personally liable for the misconduct.

Retaliation or adverse action will not be taken against an employee who, in good faith, reports or
participates in an investigation under this policy. Retaliation occurs when an employee experiences a
negative consequence because they, in good faith, ﬁled a complaint or participated in an
investigation. Retaliation is illegal and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination, even if no evidence of harassment discrimination, or related conduct is found.

---

Home Bank takes its commitment very seriously to provide an environment free of harassment,
discrimination, and retaliation, and our policy is meant to ensure employees feel comfortable asking
questions or raising concerns. You are encouraged to contact your supervisor or Human Resources
for any questions or concerns. You may also seek additional information about harassment and
discrimination from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as the applicable
state agency:

- Florida Commission on Human Relations
- Louisiana Commission on Human Rights
- Mississippi Department of Employment Security
- Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission
- Texas Workforce Commission
Our commitment to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination is unwavering, and
it is the responsibility of every single employee at Home Bank to foster a welcoming and respectful
environment that is aligned with this commitment.

###### Reasonable Accommodations
**Accommodations for Disability**
Home Bank is committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualiﬁed persons with
disabilities who can perform the essential functions of their job, with or without reasonable
accommodation, provided such accommodations impose no undue hardship on the Bank. Unless
you inform us otherwise, Home Bank assumes that you can perform the essential functions of your
job without any accommodation. If you are a qualiﬁed individual with a disability and you require a
reasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of your job, notify your
supervisor or Human Resources.

Whether accommodation is required, whether it is feasible, and the type of accommodation that is
provided is dependent upon many factors. To facilitate this process, you may be asked about the
type of accommodation you believe is necessary, the functional limitations caused by your disability,
and/or permission to obtain information from your healthcare provider.

**Accommodations for Pregnancy**
Similarly, an employee may have a need for a reasonable accommodation due to pregnancy or
conditions related to pregnancy. In accordance with applicable law, the Bank will work with
employees to provide reasonable accommodations, provided the accommodation does not impose
an undue hardship on the Bank. Such accommodations may include: more frequent or longer
breaks; time oﬀ to attend to a pregnancy complication or recover from childbirth; acquisition or
modiﬁcation of equipment or seating; a temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position;
private non-bathroom space for expressing breast milk; assistance with manual labor; and
modiﬁcation of work schedule. Employees should discuss their need for accommodation with their
supervisor or Human Resources so the Bank can work with the employee to explore options.

**Religious Accommodations**
Reasonable accommodation for an employee’s sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, and
practices may be provided when a need for such accommodation is identiﬁed and is possible. A
reasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the conﬂict between an employee’s religious
beliefs, observances, or practices and the employee’s job requirements, without causing undue
hardship to the Bank. Employees needing this type of accommodation should speak with their
supervisor or Human Resources.

###### We Own Our Intellectual Property
The protection of conﬁdential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and
success of Home Bank. Conﬁdential information is any and all information disclosed to or known by
you because of employment with the company that is not generally known to people outside the
company about its business. Conﬁdential information includes, but is not limited to, customer or
employee information and ﬁnancial data. If an employee has a question about whether any
document or information is conﬁdential in nature, they should treat such documents or information
as conﬁdential unless expressly advised otherwise by HR or a member of management.

An employee who improperly uses or discloses trade secrets, conﬁdential business information,
client or employee information will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment and legal action, even if they do not actually beneﬁt from the disclosed information.
Home Bank information (including but not limited to documents, notes, ﬁles, records, computer ﬁles
or similar materials) may not be removed from our premises without permission from Home Bank.

**Conﬁdential Information Regarding Customers and Others**
You must take all reasonable measures to protect the conﬁdentiality of non-public information about
us or our subsidiaries and our customers, shareholders and suppliers obtained or created in
connection with your activities and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such information unless
required by applicable law or regulation or legal or regulatory process.

###### Conﬁdential Information
The integrity of Home Bank necessitates that each of us maintain the highest degree of
conﬁdentiality when handling internal matters. Conﬁdential Information includes, but is not limited to:

- corporate planning data;
- pending projects and proposals;
- proprietary information;
- research and development designs and strategies;
- sales or marketing strategies;
- business operations, ﬁnancial data, and conditions;
- pricing and cost data;
- computer software systems, speciﬁcations, and related data;
- vendor, supplier, or customer lists and transactions; and
- other similar information.
This applies to conﬁdential information in any format, including verbal and written, and extends to all
forms of technology, including, but not limited to, e-mail, computers, cell phones, and USB drives.

You must take necessary measures to protect conﬁdential information, including but not limited to,
use of passwords and other security measures, securing ﬁles and documents when away from the
workstation, locking drawers at the end of the workday, etc.

Anyone who improperly uses or discloses conﬁdential information will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination, even if they do not actually beneﬁt from the disclosed
information. Home Bank also reserves the right to pursue any legal measures it deems appropriate
to address any actual or potential harm to the Bank resulting from violations of this policy, and the
employee who improperly discloses or uses the information may be subject to legal action by other
parties.

---

**Media and Outside Inquiries**
All inquiries concerning the Bank, its customers, or its operations must be passed to the Marketing
Department. No one is authorized to make statements or release information on behalf of the Bank
unless it is part of the employee’s assigned job duties or express permission has been granted by
the Marketing Department.

###### Conﬂict of Interest
Home Bank expects you to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards. Remember,
at Home Bank we do the right thing (always). Business dealings that create, or appear to create,
conﬂicts of interest either for Home Bank or you are unacceptable. Home Bank recognizes your right
to engage in private activities that are unrelated to our work. However, you must disclose any
possible conﬂicts so that Home Bank may assess and prevent potential conﬂicts from arising. A
conﬂict of interest occurs whenever you are in a position to inﬂuence a decision that may result in a
personal gain for yourself, a family member, or anyone else with whom you have a close personal
relationship. This may include making loans, waiving NSF fees or late charges, waiving document
requirements such as ﬁnancial statements, collateral documents or any other similar matter.

**Outside Employment**
In general, outside work activities are not allowed if it:

- Prevents the employee from fully performing the work for which they were employed byHome Bank, including overtime assignments.

- Involves organizations that are doing or seek to do business with Home Bank, includingexisting or potential vendors.

- Involves organizations that are in direct competition with Home Bank.
- Violates provisions of law or Home Bank’s policies or procedures.
**Acceptance of Gifts**
You should not accept entertainment, gifts, services, or other valuables from a third party seeking a
ﬁnancial relationship with Home Bank. Nominal items that are a mere token of the relationship and
not connected to or a suggestion of any business activity or transaction are acceptable (valued
under $200, cash is never acceptable), including Christmas gifts or awards from charitable
organizations. Nominal items must be within your ability to reciprocate on a personal basis, or with
legitimate claim to Home Bank for reimbursement under similar circumstances.

Although it is not possible to specify every action that might create a conﬂict of interest, this policy
sets forth those which frequently present problems. If you have any question whether an action or
proposed course of conduct would create a conﬂict of interest, you should immediately contact HR
to obtain advice on the issue to avoid potentially engaging in an undisclosed conﬂict of interest.

---

###### Code of Ethics
Everyone at Home Bank is required to maintain a consistently high standard of business conduct,
ethics and social responsibility. It is imperative that we behave in a manner that inspires public trust
and conﬁdence. Each of us must strive to avoid situations that might cause a conﬂict of interest
between Home Bank, our customers, and ourselves. Our code of ethics provides guidelines that set
general directions for our conduct. We sincerely believe that the personal growth and development
of our employees and our organization depend on continued demonstration of high levels of
integrity, ethics and social responsibility.

In addition, the ﬁnancial institution business is regulated to such an extent that many actions
considered unethical in another business may be illegal in our work environment. Criminal penalties
as well as civil money penalties can be incurred for such violations. In the event you are in doubt
about whether some action would violate a law or regulation or this policy, you should ask your
supervisor or the Internal Audit Director beforehand. We believe that living up to our standards
requires a continuing exchange of ideas and opinions; therefore, management is available to assist
you when conﬂicts arise.

Detailed policy information can be viewed on ONENET>Knowledge>Policies>Human
Resources>Code of Ethics.

###### Pay Transparency Nondiscrimination
Home Bank will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants
because they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another
employee or applicant. However, employees who have access to the compensation information of
other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of
other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation
information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in
furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted
by the employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor’s legal duty to furnish information. 41 CFR
60-1.35(c)

###### Employee Classiﬁcation
To determine eligibility for beneﬁts and overtime pay, Home Bank classiﬁes its employees as listed
below. Home Bank may review or change employee classiﬁcations at any time.

**FLSA Status – Exempt vs. Nonexempt**

- Exempt: Exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis and are not eligible to receive
overtime pay.

- Nonexempt: Nonexempt employees are paid on an hourly basis and are eligible to receive
overtime pay for overtime hours worked.

**Full-Time**
If you are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week and maintain continuous
employment status, you are considered to be full-time. Generally, as a full-time employee, you are
eligible for our full-time beneﬁts package and are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of
each program.

**Part-Time**
If you work a regular schedule of 10 hours or more but less than 30 hours per week, then you are
considered part-time. As part-time, you may be eligible for some beneﬁts and are subject to the
terms, condition and limitations for each program. Some part-time employees may also be classiﬁed
as “seasonal” and work hours during holiday seasons and college breaks.

**Temporary Employees.**
If you are hired for a speciﬁed project or time frame and may work an irregular schedule, you are
considered temporary. Temporary employees are not eligible for beneﬁts provided by Home Bank,
except those required by law, regardless of the number of hours worked.

###### We Are Invested in Your Career at Home Bank
We like to promote from within the organization. What does this mean to you? It means we
developed a job-posting program that allows you an easy way to apply for diﬀerent positions within
Home Bank. All you need to do is watch ADP (Myself, Talent, Career Center) for postings. We do
have some guidelines around these promotions and job transfers though. You need the knowledge,
skills, abilities and minimum qualiﬁcations required by that position and we recommend that you
work in your current position for approximately one year.

###### How Do I Access My Personnel File?
Personnel ﬁles are maintained by HR and are considered conﬁdential. Managers and supervisors
may only have access to personnel ﬁle information on a need-to-know basis. If you wish to review
your personnel ﬁle, please contact the Human Resource Department. Employee ﬁles may not be
taken outside of the department. Certain documents may not be eligible for review.

Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources are limited. However, we must comply with
certain requests, including but not limited to subpoenas from authorized law enforcement agencies,
or local, state, or federal courts or agencies conducting litigation, oﬃcial investigations or audits.

---

Home Bank takes seriously its duty to protect the conﬁdential information it maintains on employees,
such as social security numbers, dates of birth, direct deposit banking information, and all medical
information. In addition to its own rigorous policies to protect this information, Home Bank complies
with all legal obligations concerning the use and storage of this information.

**Important Note**
We need your help making sure your information is up to date in our ﬁles. If you have a life-changing
event, log into ADP and update your record. This could include something as simple as changing
phones to having a child.

###### Payment of Wages & Overtime
Home Bank’s pay period for all employees is biweekly and will be paid every other Friday. If payday
falls on a federal holiday, you will receive your paycheck one workday prior to the holiday.

You will be paid through direct deposit to either a savings or checking account at Home Bank or at a
bank of your choosing. You are required to activate direct deposit through ADP prior to your ﬁrst
paycheck. You can view your detailed pay information including gross pay, statutory deductions, and
voluntary deductions through ADP. In the event of an error in funds deposited, or if there are any
other discrepancies, HR must be notiﬁed immediately. You are responsible for conﬁrming your
paycheck funds are in your bank account prior to using them.

Due to the needs of the business, occasionally you may be required to work overtime. Overtime is
actual hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. Nonexempt employees will be paid time and
one-half their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40. Paid leave such as holiday,
PTO, bereavement time, sick, extended leave and jury duty do not apply towards hours worked. All
overtime must be approved by your immediate supervisor. Any unapproved overtime hours worked,
may result in disciplinary action up to possible termination. Pursuant to wage and hour laws,
nonexempt employees must be paid for all hours worked and may not “bank” time oﬀ in lieu of
receiving overtime pay.

Business needs may require employees to work on a holiday. Should this be the case Home Bank
will pay time and one-half for working on a holiday or will allow the employee to take another day oﬀ
within the calendar year following the scheduled holiday.

###### Time Records
Whether you are an exempt or nonexempt employee, you are required to record hours in ADP.
Nonexempt employees will use the timeclock and the Time Oﬀ Request feature in ADP, while
Exempt employees will use the Time Oﬀ Request feature. These records may be required by
governmental regulations and are used to calculate regular and overtime pay when applicable. If you
forget a time punch, you must immediately notify your supervisor in order to correct your time.
Under no circumstances are you allowed to clock in or out for another employee or clock yourself
out and continue working. You are also not allowed to use the ADP phone app to clock in/out unless
speciﬁcally approved by HR. In addition, clocking in/out for work should always be on a work
computer, never on a mobile device.

---

Paid time oﬀ, tardiness, absences and early departures must be recorded on the ADP time system
and approved by your supervisor. Managers are required to review and approve employee time in
ADP. Any violations of these guidelines may be subject to disciplinary action including termination.
While all hours worked will be compensated appropriately, an employee’s failure to report hours
accurately in ADP, whether too low or too high, may result in disciplinary action.

Nonexempt employees are NOT permitted to work “oﬀ the clock,” which includes after-hours
company email or cell usage on a personal device. No supervisor or manager shall participate in,
encourage or even permit a nonexempt employee to work oﬀ the clock in violation of this policy.
Employees should immediately report any violation of this policy to HR.

###### Work Hours & Breaks
Work hours are established by each department manager based on Home Bank and customer
needs. Generally, you are permitted one hour unpaid meal break each day. However, staﬃng and
coverage concerns may require you to limit your break to 30 minutes. If a nonexempt employee is
required to work through a meal break, they will be paid for the time period. You may also be
allowed up to two 10-minute rest periods each day, but know that all breaks should be approved
and scheduled by your manager to ensure proper coverage in the facility.

During any unpaid break period, nonexempt employees are not permitted to perform any work for
or on behalf of Home Bank.

Generally, employees may not combine break periods or shorten or skip their meal break to oﬀset a
late arrival or early departure. Occasional exceptions may be made with manager approval.

**Lactation Breaks**
In accordance with applicable law, Home Bank will provide reasonable break time for an employee
to express breast milk for their nursing child for the period of time prescribed in applicable law.
Employees should check with their supervisor for speciﬁc information, including the location where
the break may occur and how to account for the break time.

###### Payroll Deductions & Corrections
The government requires us to make certain deductions from employee paychecks. These include
the Federal Income Tax (FIT), Federal Social Security (FICA), Medicare Tax, and State Income Tax
(SIT). Other deductions may be made when required to comply with a court order, such as child
support. The amount of these deductions is summarized on your paystub in ADP and your W-2.

We oﬀer beneﬁt programs beyond those required by law. If eligible (please refer to summary plan
descriptions for details), you may voluntarily authorize deductions from your paycheck to cover the
cost of participation in these programs.

*The homes represent the people in the communities where we*
*serve and live. Together, we make these communities stronger.*

---

While every measure is taken to ensure your paycheck is processed correctly, payroll errors may
occur. To help us verify our payroll accuracy, you are expected to review each paycheck carefully,
and immediately report suspected errors to HR.

If we discover that you have been overpaid, we reserve the right to make appropriate payroll
deductions or make arrangements for repayment of the overage. If you leave before the overage is
repaid, the balance due may be deducted from your ﬁnal paycheck to the extent permitted by law.

**Deductions in Salary for Exempt Employees**
Exempt employees are paid on a salary basis and are generally paid their full salary for any week in
which they perform work. However, their salary may be reduced at the discretion of Home Bank in
the following circumstances:

- Employees who are absent for at least a full day because of sickness, disability, or personalreasons may not be paid for that day unless they have accrued beneﬁts under the Bank’s paid
leave policies. Their pay will not be reduced if they are absent for less than a full day for these
reasons, but an employee’s leave balance may be reduced by the amount of time the employee is
absent from work, even if the time absent is less than a full day.

- Employees who are absent from work for jury duty, attendance as a witness at a trial, or temporarymilitary leave may have their pay reduced by the amount of payment they receive in the form of
jury fees, witness fees, or military pay. Their pay will not be reduced by the number of hours or
days they are absent from work unless they perform no work in a given week.

- Employees may be suspended without pay if they are found to have violated one of the Bank’spolicies regarding proper workplace conduct, but only in full-day increments.

- Employees who work less than a full week during their ﬁrst or last week of employment will be paida proportionate part of their salary for the time actually worked.

- Actual time taken oﬀ for Family and Medical Leave (FMLA).
###### Complaints or Questions Regarding Wages or Deductions
Any employee who believes that amounts have been wrongfully deducted or withheld from his/her
pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal, state, or local law should report
the deduction to HR.

In addition, employees are required to immediately notify HR in the event they believe they have
been improperly classiﬁed as exempt from the FLSA requirements, have not properly recorded all
time worked, have not been properly paid wages or overtime due to them, or if there is a mistake in
their paycheck or any expense reimbursement, regardless of whether the mistake is to the beneﬁt of
the employee or Home Bank.

Home Bank prohibits retaliation or reprisal against any employee, who in good-faith, raises
questions or concerns regarding their pay.

As an employee of Home Bank, you may become eligible for a variety of beneﬁt programs designed
to assist you and your eligible dependents in meeting the ﬁnancial burdens that can result from
illness and disability and to help you plan for retirement. This section contains a general description
of the beneﬁts to which you may be entitled as an employee of the Bank. Please understand that this
general explanation is not intended to, and does not provide you with all the details of these
beneﬁts. Therefore, this book does not change or otherwise interpret the terms of the oﬃcial plan
documents. Your rights can be determined only by referring to the oﬃcial summary plan documents,
which were provided to you upon hire and are available from the HR Department or online through
ADP. To the extent that any of the information contained in this book is inconsistent with the oﬃcial
plan documents, the provisions of the oﬃcial documents will govern in all cases. Home Bank
reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend, modify or terminate, in whole or in
part, any or all of the provisions of the beneﬁt plans described herein, including eligibility
requirements and employee contribution amounts.

###### Health, Dental & Vision Insurance
Home Bank provides group insurance beneﬁts for you and your qualiﬁed dependents. All full-time
employees working 30 hours or more per week are eligible for insurance on the ﬁrst day of the
month following the date of employment. Home Bank will issue you a summary plan document upon
hire which will describe the beneﬁts to which you may be entitled and the provisions of the Plan.

###### Flexible Spending Account (Medical & Dependent)
Home Bank oﬀers you the opportunity to pay certain types of expenses including health care and
dependent care covered with pretax (before taxes) dollars. This results in saving the excess federal
and state income taxes and social security taxes on these funds, thereby increasing spendable
income. There are strict entrance dates for electing to participate in this plan. The amount you
choose will be transferred from your gross compensation to the FSA, where it will be held to
reimburse you for the payment of covered Plan expenses. As a reminder, any money that you
choose to defer to your FSA plan will be lost at the end of the year if you do not use it, in accordance
with Federal guidelines. Please refer to the Cafeteria Plan document for speciﬁc information.

###### Group Life Insurance
Home Bank provides eligible full-time employees with group term life insurance at no cost to you.
This coverage is subject to maximum coverage amounts and health qualiﬁcation rules of the current
life insurance policy in eﬀect. Employees should refer to the Life Insurance Plan Document for further
details. Employees are eligible for this coverage on the ﬁrst of the month following the date of
employment.

###### Retirement Plan
Home Bank recognizes the importance of saving for retirement and oﬀers eligible employees a
401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Eligibility, vesting and all other matters relating
to these plans are explained in the summary plan description, which was provided upon hire and can
also be obtained from ADP or HR.

---

###### Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
The EAP is a resource designed to provide conﬁdential counseling and referral services that can
help employees successfully deal with life’s challenges.

We want to encourage you to use this valuable service whenever you need, and you can trust that
the Bank is never informed of who uses the service or for what purpose. Detailed information on the
program can be found on ADP or you can contact HR for more information.

###### Paid Time Oﬀ
Time away from work to relax and pursue special interests is important to everyone. We encourage
you to fully enjoy your time away from the oﬃce. While PTO is intended to be used for rest and
relaxation, it may also be used for sick time (when sick time has been exhausted), personal needs,
holidays in which the Bank is open, and any other need for time oﬀ, including leave rights under any
state or federal leave law.

All **full-time employees** are eligible for paid time oﬀ (PTO) in accordance with the schedule below.

When an employee takes time oﬀ for any reason not covered under another paid leave beneﬁt, the
employee must use any accrued PTO before taking the time oﬀ unpaid.

PTO requests must be submitted through ADP and subject to approval by management. Home Bank
will try to accommodate PTO requests; however, all PTO requests are subject to availability and
staﬃng needs. In an eﬀort to accommodate the desires of our employees who would like to take
PTO earlier in the year, employees may be permitted to borrow against the PTO they expect to
accrue over the course of the calendar year. However, if your employment with Home Bank is
terminated for any reason prior to the time that you have accumulated the number of PTO days
taken during that calendar year, you are responsible for reimbursing Home Bank for the amount of
used but unaccrued PTO. A deduction will be processed for employees who have a negative PTO as
of 12/31, annually. These deductions will be made on the ﬁnal payroll, for terminated employees, and
on the last payroll of the year for active employees.

Unused PTO at year-end will be forfeited, unless prohibited by state law. Upon termination, all PTO
accrued as of the previous January 1, and not yet taken will be payable with the employee’s ﬁnal
paycheck.

###### Holidays
Holidays are selected by Home Bank annually and usually follow the federal holiday schedule.
Home Bank may also close locations early or otherwise for various occasions. You can view holiday
updates on ONENET>Bank Calendar.

All full-time employees will receive their regular rate of pay for approved holidays (not to exceed hours). A holiday will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
Part-time employees who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible to receive holiday pay if
that holiday falls on their regularly scheduled day (for example, Sally works 5 hours a day on
Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. Labor Day is scheduled on a Monday, so that means Sally will
receive 5 hours of holiday pay.)

PTO or Time Oﬀ Awards on the day before and/or after a bank paid holiday should always be
scheduled in advance and is subject to management approval. If an employee calls in sick and/or
schedules it as a sick day, a doctor’s note may be required in order to utilize any available sick time.
If an employee calls in for personal reasons (not sick and not pre-approved), then any available
accrued PTO or Time Oﬀ Award would be used, and the employee would be subject to disciplinary
action. Situations beyond the employee’s control such as ﬂight cancellation where proof can be
provided may be considered excused absence.

All part-time employees who are scheduled to work on a day the holiday falls will receive holiday
pay. The employee will receive holiday pay for the hours scheduled to work.

When a scheduled holiday occurs during an employee’s pre-approved PTO, they will receive holiday
pay and will not be charged PTO for the holiday.

---

###### Sick Days
Paid sick days are provided to eligible employees to cover personal illness, necessary doctor’s
appointments or for the care of dependent child or spouse. Sick leave may also be used for the care
of a dependent whose illness exceeds ﬁve consecutive working days and would be covered under
the Family Medical Leave Act. All illnesses must be called in to your immediate supervisor, or if they
are unavailable, you may contact another manager or HR. Additionally, a doctor’s note will be
required when requested by management.

All regular, full-time, non-oﬃcer employees, Bank Oﬃcers, Sr. Bank Oﬃcers and Assistant Vice
Presidents are eligible for six sick days per year, Vice President and above are eligible for 12 sick
days per year. Sick days for existing employees will be awarded at the beginning of each year. New
hire sick days are prorated, and accrue at a rate of half day per month beginning on the employee’s
ﬁrst day of employment. All new hire employees Vice President and above will accrue sick days at a
rate of one day per month. Eligibility for sick leave pay begins after the ﬁrst 60 days of employment.

**Part-time employees:** After completing the ﬁrst sixty (60) days of employment, working an average
of 20 hours or more per week will receive three days of sick time equivalent to their scheduled
hours for the day.

###### Extended Leave
Unused sick leave days, determined at year end, will be carried over into a separate Extended Leave
bank of time up to the max allowed*. If an employee has been granted extended leave for a period
exceeding ﬁve working days, an employee may choose to use the Extended Leave paid at 100% of
pay.

**Extended Leave may be used as follows:**

- For an employee’s personal illness that a doctor has placed them out of work for 3 - 5 consecutivedays (example: ﬂu, covid).

- Doctor’s note for ﬂu/covid or Telemedicine note plus copy of covid in-home test, must beprovide to HR and the employee must request use of Extended Leave.

- For the care of a dependent whose illness exceeds 5 consecutive working days and would becovered under the Family Medical Leave Act.

- For purpose of extended leave, a dependent is deﬁned as the employee’s spouse, childor parent.

**Max allowed: Non-Oﬃcer up to Asst. Vice President may accrue up to a maximum of 30 days in*
*Extended Leave. Vice President to Executive Vice President may accrue up to a maximum of 50*
*days in Extended Leave.*

###### Bereavement Pay
Employees may take up to three days of paid bereavement leave upon the death of a member of
their immediate family. Immediate family members are deﬁned as an employee’s spouse, domestic
partner, parents (including in *loco parentis* (in place of a parent), stepparents, siblings, children,
stepchildren, grandparent, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law,
daughter-in-law, or grandchild.

The company may require veriﬁcation of the need for the leave. Payment for bereavement leave is
computed at the regular hourly rate to a maximum of 8 hours for one day. Time oﬀ granted in
accordance with this policy shall not be credited as time worked for the purpose of computing
overtime.

---

###### Jury Duty - Your Civic Duty
Home Bank supports you in your civic duty to serve on a jury. A leave of absence for jury duty will be
granted to anyone full-time or part-time who has been summoned to serve. You will be paid for jury
duty up to maximum of ﬁve (5) days at your regular rate of pay, or in accordance with applicable state
law, not to exceed the number of hours you would have been scheduled to work that day. You may
use any accrued PTO if required to serve more than ﬁve days on a jury. Upon receipt of the notice to
serve jury duty, you should immediately provide a copy of your summons to your supervisor.

###### Military Leave
Home Bank supports the military obligations of all employees and grants leaves for uniformed
service in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. Any employee who needs time oﬀ for
uniformed service should immediately notify HR and their supervisor. If an employee is unable to
provide notice before leaving for uniformed service, a family member should notify the supervisor as
soon as possible.

Upon return from military leave, you will be granted the same seniority, pay, and beneﬁts as if you
had worked continuously. Failure to report for work within the prescribed time after completion of
military service will be considered a voluntary resignation from Home Bank.

All employees who enter military service may accumulate a total absence of ﬁve years and still retain
employment rights. Employees should also refer to the Leave under the Family and Medical Leave
Act for further rights and responsibilities regarding military leave.

###### Family & Medical Leave (FMLA)
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees the opportunity to
take unpaid, job-protected leave for certain speciﬁed reasons. The maximum amount of leave an
employee may use is either 12 or 26 weeks within a 12-month period, depending on the reasons for
the leave.

To be eligible for family/medical leave, you must have worked for the bank for at least 12 months and
for at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before leave is to begin. Additionally, you must work in a
location where there are at least 50 employees within 75 miles of that location.

*Acorns grow into massive oak trees. Though we start out small, let’s*
*remain rooted in humility together as we grow into our full potential.*

Additional bereavement time oﬀ or time oﬀ for other family relationships, may be requested through
Human Resources and the request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Home Bank understands
that circumstances vary in times of grief and will work with employees seeking additional time oﬀ,
which may include requesting personal leave of absence.

---

Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:

- birth of a child, or to care for a newly-born child (up to 12 weeks);

- placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care (up to 12 weeks);

- to care for an immediate family member (employee’s spouse, child, or parent) with a serious healthcondition (up to 12 weeks);

- because of the employee’s serious health condition that makes the employee unable to performthe employee’s job (up to 12 weeks);

- to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness related to certain types ofmilitary service (up to 26 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or

- to handle certain qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son,daughter, or parent is on duty under a call or order to active duty in the Uniformed Services (up to
12 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details).

The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in a 12-month period for all reasons combined is weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a covered service member, the maximum combined
leave entitlement is 26 weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those
26 weeks.

Note that in cases where the Bank employs spouses, the spouses are limited to a combined total of
12 weeks of FMLA due to the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child or to care for a
parent with a serious health condition. Additional parameters apply for spouses who work for the
Bank, so these employees should work with Human Resources to determine exactly how much time
each spouse is eligible for under FMLA, depending on the circumstances of the leave.

**Deﬁnitions**
A *serious health condition* is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care
provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the
employee’s job, or prevents the qualiﬁed family member from participating in school or other daily
activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement includes an incapacity
of more than three full calendar days and two visits to a health care provider or one visit to a health
care provider and a continuing regimen of care; an incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal
visits, a chronic condition, or permanent or long-term conditions; or absences due to multiple
treatments. Other situations may meet the deﬁnition of continuing treatment.

A *covered service member* is a customer or veteran of the Armed Forces, including the National
Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in
outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness.

The term *serious injury or illness* means an injury or illness incurred by the customer in the line of
duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the customer medically unﬁt to
perform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating or one that existed before the
beginning of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty. With
regard to veterans, the injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed
veteran status.

---

*Qualifying exigencies* include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging
alternative childcare, making ﬁnancial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and
recuperation, counseling, and post-deployment debrieﬁngs.

**Identifying the 12-Month Period**
The 12-month period in which 12 weeks of leave may be taken is a rolling 12-month period measured
backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA leave for the birth or placement
of a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12 months of the birth or placement.

**Using Leave**
Eligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks
of time), or by reducing the normal work schedule when medically necessary for the serious health
condition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a covered service member,
their injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for
military qualifying exigencies. Intermittent leave is not permitted for the birth of a child, to care for a
newly born child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Employees who require
intermittent or reduced-schedule leave must try to schedule their leave so that it will not unduly
disrupt the Bank's operations.

**Use of Accrued Paid Leave**
To the extent you have any accrued PTO and/or sick time, you are required to use it concurrently
with your FMLA leave. Beneﬁts received under other income replacement programs, such as disabil-
ity or workers’ compensation also run concurrently with FMLA and do not extend the period of
FMLA. However, employees may be able to supplement these paid beneﬁts with available vacation
and/or sick, to a maximum of 100% of their regular base pay for the week.

**Maintenance of Health Beneﬁts**
If you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, the Bank will maintain coverage during
your FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. You must make arrangements
to pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave prior to beginning leave, unless the need
for leave in unforeseeable, in which case you must make arrangements as soon as possible. In some
instances, the Bank may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other beneﬁts for
you and your family.

**Notice and Medical Certiﬁcation**
When seeking FMLA leave, you are required to provide:

- suﬃcient information and documentation for us to determine if the requested leave qualiﬁes forFMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. You must also inform the
bank if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certiﬁed;

- if the need for leave is foreseeable, this information must be provided 30 days in advance of theanticipated beginning date of the leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, this information
must be provided as soon as is practicable and in compliance with the bank’s normal call-in
procedures, absent unusual circumstances;

---

- periodic reports as deemed appropriate by the bank during the leave regarding your status andintent to return to work; and

- medical certiﬁcation of ﬁtness for duty before returning to work, if the leave was due to your serioushealth condition. The bank will require this certiﬁcation to address whether you can perform the
essential functions of your position.

Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

**Employer Responsibilities**
To the extent required by law, the bank will inform employees whether they are eligible under FMLA.
Should an employee be eligible for FMLA, the bank will provide them with a notice that speciﬁes any
additional information required as well as the employee’s rights and responsibilities. If employees are
not eligible, the bank will provide a reason for the ineligibility. The bank will also inform employees if
leave will be designated as FMLA and, to the extent possible, note the amount of leave counted
against the employee’s leave entitlement. If the bank determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected,
the bank will notify the employee.

**Job Restoration**
Upon returning from FMLA leave, eligible employees will typically be restored to their original job or to
an equivalent job with equivalent pay, beneﬁts, and other employment terms and conditions.

**Exemption for Key Employees**
Certain key employees may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if
doing so would cause substantial economic injury to the bank. Key employees are salaried and among
the highest paid 10 percent of all employees. The bank will notify you if you qualify as a key employee
and if the bank intends to deny reinstatement and your rights in such instances.

**Failure to Return After FMLA Leave**
Any employee who fails to return to work as scheduled after FMLA leave or exceeds the 12-week
FMLA entitlement (or in the case of military caregiver leave, the 26-week FMLA entitlement), will be
subject to the bank’s standard leave of absence and attendance policies. This will result in
termination if you have no other bank-provided or legally mandated leave available to you that applies
to your continued absence. Likewise, following the conclusion of your FMLA leave, the bank’s
obligation to maintain your group health plan beneﬁts ends (subject to any applicable COBRA rights).

**Fraud**
Providing false or misleading information or omitting material information in connection with an FMLA
leave will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

**Employers’ Compliance with FMLA and Employee’s Enforcement Rights**
FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right
provided under FMLA, or discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice
made unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA.

While the Bank encourages employees to bring any concerns or complaints about compliance with
FMLA to the attention of management, FMLA regulations require employers to advise employees that
they may ﬁle a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or bring a private lawsuit against an
employer.

---

Further, FMLA does not aﬀect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, nor does it
supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or
medical leave rights.

**Limited Nature of This Policy**
This policy should not be construed to confer any express or implied contractual relationship or
rights to any employee not expressly provided for by FMLA. The Bank reserves the right to modify
this or any other policy as necessary, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law. State or
local leave laws may also apply.

**Military-Related Federal FMLA Leave**
FMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related
medical and nonmedical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The ﬁrst is
Military Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is
detailed below.

**Military Caregiver Leave**
Unpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family
members who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty.
The family member must be a “covered service member,” which means: (1) a current customer or
veteran of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Reserves, (2) who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy; or, in the case of a veteran, who was a current customer of the Armed
Forces, National Guard or Reserves within ﬁve years prior to the treatment for which an eligible
employee requests leave; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary disabili-
ty retired list, (3) for a serious injury or illness that may render a current customer medically unﬁt to
perform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating. Military Caregiver Leave is not
available to care for service members on the permanent disability retired list.

To be eligible for Military Caregiver Leave, the employee must be a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or
next of kin of the covered service member. *Next of kin* means the nearest blood relative of the
service member, other than the service member’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following
order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by
court decree or statutory provisions; brothers and sisters; grandparents; aunts and uncles; and ﬁrst
cousins; unless the service member has speciﬁcally designated in writing another blood relative as
his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of Military Caregiver Leave. The employee must also
meet all other eligibility standards as set forth within this FMLA policy.

An eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave to care for a covered
service member in a *single 12-month period* . The *single 12-month period* begins on the ﬁrst day
leave is taken to care for a covered service member and ends 12 months thereafter, regardless of
the method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an employee
does not exhaust his or her 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this *single 12-month*
*period* , the remainder is forfeited.

Military Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each service member. Consequently, an
eligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every covered service
member, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same covered service member. A
total of no more than 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave, however, may be taken within any
“single 12-month period.”

---

Within the *single 12-month period* described above, an eligible employee may take a combined total
of 26 weeks of FMLA leave including up to 12 weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason
(i.e., birth or adoption of a child, serious health condition of the employee or close family member, or
a qualifying exigency). For example, during the *single 12-month period* , an eligible employee may
take up to 16 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered service member when combined with up to
10 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child.

An employee seeking Military Caregiver Leave may be required to provide appropriate certiﬁcation
from the employee and/or covered service member and completed by an authorized health care
provider within 15 days.

Military Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in this FMLA policy (requirements
regarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice, use of accrued paid leave, etc.). Military Caregiver
Leave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations,
and nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations.

**Qualifying Exigency Leave**
Eligible employees may take unpaid *Qualifying Exigency Leave* to tend to certain *exigencies* arising
out of the duty under a call or order to active duty of a *covered military customer* (i.e., the
employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent). Up to 12 weeks of Qualifying Exigency Leave is
available in any 12-month period, as measured by the same method that governs measurement of
other forms of FMLA leave within this FMLA policy (with the exception of Military Caregiver Leave,
which is subject to a maximum of 26 weeks of leave in a *single 12-month period* ). Although
Qualifying Exigency Leave may be combined with leave for other FMLA-qualifying reasons, under no
circumstances may the combined total exceed 12 weeks in any 12-month period (with the exception
of Military Caregiver Leave as set forth above). The employee must meet all other eligibility
standards as set forth within this FMLA policy.

Persons who can be ordered to active duty include active and retired customers of the Regular
Armed Forces, certain customers of the retired Reserve, and various other Reserve customers
including the Ready Reserve, the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve, the National
Guard, state military, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, Air
Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. A call to active duty refers to a federal call to active duty,
and state calls to active duty are not covered unless under order of the CEO of the United States
pursuant to certain laws.

###### Short Term Disability
Home Bank provides eligible employees with a paid short-term disability beneﬁt. Any time taken
under this policy that also qualiﬁes as FMLA or under a state leave law protection, will run concurrent
with STD. While STD runs concurrent with FMLA, an employee may have separate instances where
STD may qualify. This is not to exceed the maximum allowed STD beneﬁt within the rolling 12-month
period. This beneﬁt only applies to disabilities of the employee, not to disabilities of his/her
dependents or family members.

---

**Which Employees Are Eligible?**
Full-time employees who have completed 12 months of uninterrupted full-time employment are
eligible.

**Which Short-Term Disabilities are Eligible?**
Home Bank will grant paid short-term disability leave to eligible employees for disabilities resulting
from personal illness or accidents which preclude the employee from performing the essential
functions of his or her position, produce signiﬁcant physical symptoms and necessitate hospital care
or continuing physician care

Any employee who is seeking a paid short-term disability leave of absence must submit a request in
writing for such leave to HR at least 30 days prior to the beginning of such leave. In the event the
employee has less than 30 days’ notice of an expected short-term disability leave of absence, notice
should be given as soon as possible. Failure to provide complete and timely medical certiﬁcation will
result in delay of beneﬁts under this policy. If the medical certiﬁcation by the employee’s physician is
questionable, Home Bank reserves the right to contact the physician in order to clarify any unclear or
doubtful diagnosis or treatment regimen. If the employee’s physician chooses to remain unavailable
to speak with a representative of Home Bank regarding the medical certiﬁcation, Home Bank
reserves the right to delay the commencement or continuation of paid leave until all questions are
answered to Home Bank’s satisfaction.

There is a ﬁve day waiting period for beneﬁts during which you will be required to use any available
extended leave, sick or paid time oﬀ days. After the ﬁve (5) week period and until the 90th calendar
day of disability, the duration of paid beneﬁts is based on oﬃcer status and years of service as
follows:

Non-oﬃcer, Bank Oﬃcer, Sr. Bank Oﬃcer and Assistant Vice Presidents:
5 years or less of service - 5 weeks at 80% pay
6 or more years of service - 5 weeks + 1 week at 80% of the employee’s regular base salary for each

completed year of service over 5 years with beneﬁts stopping upon the
90th calendar day of the disability

Vice President and above:
80% of regular base pay until 90th calendar day of the disability. An employee who is still disabled
after 90 calendar days may be eligible for long-term disability beneﬁts. Please refer to the section on
and summary plan description for Long-term Disability beneﬁts.

After ﬁve weeks, if medically necessary, an employee can use accrued PTO, sick or extended leave
up until the 90th calendar day in order to stay in a paid status. Employees can also use accrued PTO,
sick or extended leave to cover the 20% of unpaid time.

###### Long-Term Disability
Home Bank oﬀers all full-time employees working at least 40 hours per week a Long-term Disability
(LTD) insurance plan at no cost to the employee. This plan provides monthly LTD beneﬁts equal to
60% of basic monthly earnings up to a maximum beneﬁt of $5,000 per month. Employees are
eligible for this coverage on the ﬁrst of the month following date of hire.

Beneﬁts under the Long-Term Disability Plan are determined at the sole discretion of the insurance
carrier. For speciﬁc information concerning limitations and beneﬁt details, you should refer to your
Long-Term Disability summary plan document.

---

###### Leaves of Absence (Non-FMLA)
We recognize that employees may need to request a leave of absence for medical, family, or
personal reasons when they are not eligible for a federal or state-speciﬁc leave right, or another
Home Bank leave policy.

During any leave, an employee will be required to use any earned time oﬀ beneﬁts before taking the
time as unpaid, unless the employee’s leave is covered under another income replacement beneﬁt,
such as workers’ compensation. In these cases, to the extent the income replacement beneﬁts
permit, the employee may use earned but unused time oﬀ beneﬁts to supplement these other
payments, as long as the employee’s total wages for the week do not exceed 100% of the
employee’s regular base rate of pay.

Leaves fall into one of three categories:

- Medical leave is for any illness or injury of the employee, including pregnancy and childbirth.

- Family leave includes caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or caring for an immediatefamily member with a serious illness or injury. For purposes of this policy, immediate family members
are deﬁned as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner, child, or parent.

- Personal leave is for all other requests not included under medical or family leave or other Bank,federal, or state leave law and is granted under limited circumstances at the sole discretion of Home
Bank’s management, based on various factors, including the general performance record of the
employee and the operating needs of the Bank.

If the leave is for a medical or family related reason, the leave will be considered in accordance with
any legal requirements in addition to this policy. To the extent permitted by law, the need for more
than one type of leave may be combined, and leaves will run concurrently with any other leaves.

Employees must provide their supervisor and Human Resources notice of the need for leave as far
in advance as is practicable. Requests must include documented proof of the need for leave, the
date leave is to begin and the expected date of return. Leave requests for the employee’s or an
immediate family member’s illness or injury must accompany a physician’s documentation and
statement supporting the need for leave. Depending on the nature of the leaves, additional
documentation may be required.

When leave is due to the employee’s own illness or injury, Home Bank reserves the right to have the
employee examined by a physician of the Bank’s choosing and at the Bank’s expense to support the
need for leave. Employees may also be required to provide periodic physician documentation during
their leave to support the need for continued leave in addition to a physician’s certiﬁcation
permitting them to return to work at the completion of the leave period. Employees may also be
required to maintain contact with their supervisor during a leave at designated intervals about their
status and tentative return to work plans.

While on leave, Home Bank will pay for its portion of the employee’s insurance premiums for the
length of time of approved leave. The employee is required to make payment arrangements with the
Bank for their portion. Continuation of beneﬁts beyond this period is at the employee’s expense
through COBRA. Time oﬀ beneﬁts and any other Bank sponsored beneﬁts do not accrue during
unpaid leaves.

---

We recognize that circumstances may occasionally prevent an employee from returning to work as
planned. These situations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the law, to
determine if approval of additional leave time can be granted.

We will attempt to reinstate employees returning from a leave to their same or similar position;
however, depending on the nature and length of the leave, there may not be a guarantee that we
will be able to return an employee to any position upon completion of their leave. In making these
decisions, Home Bank complies with all applicable laws regarding reinstatement.

Employees who fail to return to work the day after an approved leave ends will be deemed to have
voluntarily resigned from their employment.

For complete information about leaves of absence, please contact Human Resources.

###### Additional Leaves
###### The leave rights outlined in this handbook are applicable to all employees, provided they meet
###### the eligibility requirements for a particular leave (which may include the requirement that the
###### employee be full-time). States, however, may have additional leave protections that certain
###### employees may be entitled to receive. If you have the need for time oﬀ that is not covered under
###### a policy listed in this Handbook, please discuss your need with Human Resources so that we can
###### determine if your request is protected under any additional state law. General examples include
###### state-speciﬁc family, medical, and/or military leave rights.

###### Please note that unless speciﬁcally prohibited by law, when an employee’s need for leave is
###### covered under more than one leave law, leave time under the laws runs concurrently.

###### Accrual of PTO During Leave
###### Home Bank awards accrual time based on time worked; therefore, when an employee is out on
###### any approved leave of absence (Short Term Disability, Workers’ Compensation or any other
###### approved leave), the accrual of PTO time will cease. PTO accruals will continue upon return from
###### leave.

*The hearts represent the connection and bonds we form*
*as a team. We strive to support and care for one another.*

###### Attendance
Everyone is expected to arrive on time and ready to work. If you are unable to arrive at work on time,
or will be absent for an entire day, you must contact your supervisor as soon as possible, but no later
than your scheduled start time.

Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
If an employee fails to report to work or call in to inform the supervisor of the absence for three
consecutive days or more, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned from Home
Bank.

For security and professional reasons, we do not allow our employees to bring their children to work.
Exceptions may be made during emergency situations.

###### General Standards of Conduct
Every employee is expected to observe certain standards of conduct. This is critical for the safety,
well-being and productivity of our employees, customers, and the bank as a whole.

When an employee has not met the bank’s standards, the action taken, which may include verbal
counseling, a written warning, suspension with or without pay, and/or termination of employment,
will be determined based on the individual circumstances. The bank does not guarantee that one
form of action will precede another.

Certain conduct is of such a serious nature that immediate termination may be warranted. Examples
include, but are not limited to:

- Violation of the bank’s policies or procedures
- Unauthorized or illegal possession, use or sale of alcohol or illegal or controlled substances onwork premises, during work hours, or while engaged in bank activities

- Unauthorized possession, use or sale of weapons, ﬁrearms or explosives on work premises orwhile engaged in bank activities

---

The legal use of prescribed or over-the-counter drugs is permitted on-the-job only if it does not
impair an employee’s ability to perform their job eﬀectively and in a safe manner that does not
endanger the employee or other individuals in the workplace. Employees must inform their
supervisor and Human Resources if they are taking medication that could impact their ability to
safely perform their duties.

**Drug Testing**
Home Bank reserves the right to conduct alcohol and drug testing at any time and may include the
following tests, in accordance with applicable state law.

- Pre-employment: All candidates oﬀered employment must pass a drug test before beginning work.

- Reasonable suspicion: Employees are subject to testing based on observations by a supervisor of
apparent workplace use, possession or impairment. HR must be consulted before sending an
employee for reasonable suspicion testing.

- Post-accident: Employees are subject to testing when they cause or contribute to accidents that
seriously damage a company vehicle, machinery, equipment or property and/or result in an injury to
themselves or another employee requiring medical attention. In any of these instances, the
investigation and subsequent testing must take place within two (2) hours following the accident, if
not sooner.

- Follow-up: Employees who have tested positive, or otherwise violated this policy, are subject to
discipline including immediate termination. Depending on the circumstances and the employee’s
work history/record, Home Bank may oﬀer an employee who violates this policy or tests positive
the opportunity to return to work on a last-chance basis pursuant to mutually agreeable terms,
which could include mandatory rehabilitation services as well as follow-up drug testing at times and
frequencies for a minimum of one (1) year but not more than two (2) years. If the employee either
does not complete their required rehabilitation program or tests positive after completing the
rehabilitation program, they will be subject to immediate termination of employment.

**Inspections**
Home Bank reserves the right to inspect all portions of its premises, including personal property
brought on to the premises, for drugs, alcohol or other contraband. Employees who refuse to
cooperate in such inspections or, after an inspection has been determined to have violated this or
any other bank policy, are subject to appropriate discipline up to and including termination.

**Crimes Involving Drugs**
Home Bank prohibits all employees from manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing or
using an illegal drug in or on company premises or while conducting company business. Employees
are also prohibited from misusing legally prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Law
enforcement personnel shall be notiﬁed, as appropriate, when criminal activity is suspected.

---

Although our policy against substance abuse in the workplace is strict, we recognize that substance
abuse can be a condition that can be successfully treated. If you believe that substance abuse is a
problem for you, you are encouraged to get conﬁdential professional help. An employee with a
substance abuse problem is required to maintain the same standards of conduct and performance
as all other employees but will not be disciplined solely for admitting the need to seek help. Home
Bank may provide an unpaid leave for an employee to enroll in an appropriate rehabilitation
program, consistent with the Bank’s leaves of absence policies.

To the extent permitted by applicable state law, all aspects of this policy apply fully to the use of
marijuana and CBD products, even when used for medicinal purposes. Employees seeking
accommodation for lawful and prescribed use should contact Human Resources to determine what,
if any, accommodations are available. In making these determinations, safety in the workplace and
adherence to applicable laws will always be Home Bank’s priority.

###### Dress For Success
At Home Bank, we pride ourselves on our professional image and that includes our dress code. We
expect all our employees to be dressed in appropriate business attire.

Everyone is expected to be well-groomed, exhibit acceptable personal hygeine, wear clean clothing,
free of holes, tears, or other signs of wear. Clothing should not be revealing and should be
conservative. Managers are expected to make sure employees dress appropriately
and professionally.

If you report to work inappropriately groomed or attired you may be asked to leave and change into
acceptable clothing. In such instances, time away from work will be without pay. Any questions or
problems concerning the uniforms should be directed to your manager or HR.

If you require an exception to accepted attire due to, for example, a medical condition or religious
observance, please contact HR.

For further guidance please refer to the Dress Code guidelines found under the Human Resources
homepage of OneNet.

###### Employment of Relatives
For proper security and to eliminate conﬂicts of interest, members of an employee's immediate
family will need to be reviewed and approved by Human Resources prior to being employed by
Home Bank including temporary or seasonal employment. Immediate family includes the
employee’s spouse/domestic partner, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, in-laws, aunts,
uncles, or nieces.

Current employees who marry each other or become involved in a domestic partnership may be
permitted to continue employment with the company provided they do not work in a direct
supervisory relationship with each other, create adverse impact on work performance, create morale
issues or otherwise pose potential conﬂicts of interest. If issues arise, Home Bank reserves the right
to take any steps it deems appropriate, including reassignment or termination of one or both
employees in order to protect the Bank’s interests and the integrity of working relationships.
Employees who establish such a relationship must promptly report it to Human Resources.

In all situations, employees are expected to exercise good judgment with respect to evaluating the
potential for conﬂicts relationships can bring to the workplace and to ensure relationship issues do
not interfere in any way with their work or the work of others.

---

###### Public Relations
**Articles, Letters, and Other Public Forums**
When writing personal letters, articles, or testimonials to be published or when using applications
such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., you are cautioned to use discretion. You should avoid situations that
may be misinterpreted as a public endorsement by Home Bank. You are expected to maintain a
professional image at all times when dealing with the public or communicating in public forums.
Your communications may be personal in nature, however, if in a public forum, they are a reﬂection
of Home Bank.

**Media and Press Releases**
No Home Bank employee is authorized to act as a spokesperson on behalf of Home Bank. All
requests for advertisements, interviews, sponsorships or promotional items should be directed to the
Marketing Department. All advertising copy, press releases, sales collateral and customer
communication (such as sales ﬂyers, printed materials or handouts) must be created or approved by
the Marketing Department. You are required to contact the Marketing Department for authorization
before using the Home Bank logo on any item.

###### OneNet
All employees are expected to check news updates and policies posted on OneNet or ADP for new
and/or updated information and to follow the guidance set forth in all posted notices.

###### Acceptable Use of Technology Resources
We have an established set of policies to help protect our bank resources, as well as nonpublic bank
and customer information. Speciﬁc details are included in the Home Bank Acceptable Use Policy
that can be located on OneNet>Knowledge>Policies>Information Security or by contacting the
Information Security Department. This policy is also provided to all new employees on our new hire
web portal. It is extremely important you familiarize yourself with all the information contained in this
policy because failure to comply with these policies may lead to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.

**Social Media Policy**
When you are participating in social networking, you are representing both yourself personally and
Home Bank. The same principles and guidelines that apply to Home Bank’s employee activities in
general, apply to employee activities online. This includes forms of online publishing and discussion,
including blogs, wikis, ﬁle-sharing, user-generated video and audio, virtual worlds and social
networks, etc.

Home Bank fully respects the legal rights of our employees in all areas in which we operate. As an
employee of Home Bank, be aware that you are responsible for the content you post and that
information remains in cyberspace forever. Use privacy settings when appropriate. Remember, the
Internet is immediate and nothing posted is ever truly private nor does it expire.

Be respectful of others. Think of what you say online in the same way as statements you might make
to the media, or e-mails you might send to people you do not know. Always be fair and courteous to
fellow employees, customers, suppliers or people who work on behalf of Home Bank.

Home Bank prohibits taking negative action against any employee for reporting a possible deviation
from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation. Any employee who retaliates against another
employee for reporting a possible deviation from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will
be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

---

Users who violate this policy may be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of
employment. If you have any questions about the policy or a speciﬁc posting out on the web,
please contact HR.

###### Internal Investigations & Searches
Home Bank may conduct internal investigations pertaining to security, auditing or work-related
matters. Work areas (i.e. desk, ﬁle cabinets, computer, Home Bank email accounts etc.) may be
subject to a search without prior notice, as may any personal possessions or articles brought onto
the property (packages, purses, backpacks, briefcases, etc.). That means you should not have
expectations of privacy and are required to cooperate fully with and assist in these investigations.

Home Bank also makes use of surveillance cameras throughout the property, excluding restrooms
and similar areas. The bank monitors these cameras for a number of reasons to promote the safety
and security of the property and all individuals on the property, and employees should expect that
any of their activities may be captured on these cameras and viewed by management without notice
to the employee. When appropriate, camera activity may be turned over to law enforcement.

###### Reference Checks
All inquiries regarding a current or former Home Bank employee must be referred to HR.

###### Smoking Policy
Smoking is not allowed in company buildings or work areas at any time. *Smoking* includes the use of
any tobacco products, electronic smoking devices, and e-cigarettes.

Smoking is only permitted during break times in designated outdoor areas. Employees using these
areas are expected to dispose of any smoking debris safely and properly and keep the property
clean.

###### Expense Reimbursement
Home Bank shall reimburse employees for ordinary and necessary business expenses directly
related to company activities. Reimbursement will be limited to the actual cost of allowable
employee business expense incurred and requires the timely completion, approval, and submission
of an expense report accompanied by adequate supporting documentation. You are encouraged to
submit reimbursable expenses on a monthly basis. Expenses not submitted within 60 days may not
be reimbursed.

**Travel**
All expenditures regarding travel require advance approval from management. Travel
expenses must be listed in detail and receipts should accompany an expense report. Authorized
travel by employees will be reimbursed at the current IRS rate per mile when the use of a personal
car is involved.

###### Overdraft(s) on Your Home Bank Account(s)
We encourage you to bank with us. Banking with us means you get to really know our products and
services. We do expect everyone to manage their personal accounts accordingly and avoid
overdrafts and late loan payments. Any overdraft charges for Directors or Executive Oﬃcers will not
be waived and are ineligible for our Overdraft Privilege Service. Other employees may be eligible for
one overdraft fee waiver per year and are eligible for our Overdraft Privilege Service. After ﬁve (5)
days overdrawn in excess of the Overdraft Privilege service in a calendar year, the unsatisfactory
account will be reported to HR and the employee may be subject to disciplinary action including but
not limited to lost checking account privileges and possible termination of employment.

###### Our Commitment to Safety
```

Protecting the safety of our employees and customers is one of our most important duties.
Everyone has the opportunity and responsibility to contribute to a safe work environment by using
commonsense rules and safe practices and by notifying Facilities when health or safety issues are
present. Everyone is encouraged to partner with Facilities to ensure maximum safety for all.

Everyone is scheduled to receive safety and robbery training and is required to attend any training
session provided by Home Bank that is related to workplace safety and security.

In the event of an emergency, notify the appropriate emergency personnel by dialing 9 for an
outside line, then dial 911 to activate the medical emergency services. All accidents must be reported
to Facilities and HR. You can report accidents through OneNet>Knowledge>Forms>Facilities>
Accident/Incident Report Form. Failure to report any accidents may lead to disciplinary action up to
termination. Additionally, notify management of any emergency situation, including accidents,
medical situations, threats of violence, etc., as well as any accident or injury of a visitor on the
property.

###### Workplace Violence
We are committed to providing a safe workplace. We do not tolerate violent behavior whether com-
mitted by or against an employee. Violent or threating behavior may take many forms, including
physical acts, oral or written statements, email messages, phone calls, or gestures and expressions.
Examples include, but are not limited to, intimidation, bullying, threats, physical attacks, property
damage, or other direct or indirect conduct that threatens personal safety or property or could be
interpreted as an intent to cause harm to person(s) or property. Even casual remarks, joking,
horseplay, and unintentional conduct may violate this policy and will be taken seriously.

If you receive or overhear any threatening communications from an employee, customer or any
other individual, or you have reason to believe a threat may exist, immediately report it to an
available member of management or HR. Contact 911 for threats of immediate harm. Do not
attempt to intervene with a potentially violent individual.

Home Bank as the property owner reserves the right to prohibit employees from carrying any
weapons on the premises. The CEO and/or Security Oﬃcer may grant the authorization to carry a
weapon in cases where job descriptions or circumstances warrant. Additionally, in accordance with
our Internal Investigations and Searches procedures, Home Bank reserves the right to conduct
searches for weapons on bank property at any time. Any violations may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination.

###### Workers’ Compensation
We provide workers’ compensation insurance for all employees in accordance with applicable law.
Since workers’ compensation wage beneﬁts generally do not cover full salary, accrued paid time oﬀ
may be used to make up the diﬀerence between your beneﬁts and your regular base rate of pay.
Once all paid time oﬀ is used up, you will receive only workers’ compensation beneﬁts. Workers’
compensation beneﬁts will run concurrently with FMLA leave, if applicable.

---

**Reporting Work Related Injury/Illness**
In the event of a work-related injury or illness, you must notify your supervisor and/or HR
immediately. This notiﬁcation is required even if the injury/illness seems minor and/or no time is lost
from work. This is necessary to ensure that any subsequent claim is handled correctly and to comply
```python
from work. This is necessary to ensure that any subsequent claim is handled correctly and to comply
with legal reporting and record maintenance requirements. An accident and injury form is available
on OneNet>Knowledge> Forms>Facilities>Accident/Incident Report. Failure to report injuries or
```

illnesses could result in disciplinary action, and may also result in a claim being denied by our
insurance carrier.

###### Emergency Closing
We normally operate Monday through Saturday on a variety of schedules. In the event of
emergencies that aﬀect normal business operations, the Emergency Response Management Team
(ERMT) will make a determination whether the oﬃce will be open or closed, and will notify
employees by phone, text, email, website, or other possible means.

###### Business Continuity
Home Bank recognizes the need to protect employees during an emergency and to have detailed
recovery plans to provide for the continuity of operations of the Bank in an emergency or disaster
situation. Details on the plan can be found on OneNet>Knowledge>Policies>Operations. Home Bank
will maintain communications with all employees, keep in mind it is the employee’s responsibility to
be in communication with their manager/department during any emergency situation.

###### Tidying Up Our Spaces
Good housekeeping by all of us is important to maintain a safe and healthy work environment. It
means better and more pleasant working conditions, helps reduce accidents, adds to the eﬃciency
of our operations, and contributes to the quality of our work and the services we provide. Everyone
is expected to keep areas neat and clean at all times.

*Your internal compass guides you to do the right thing.*
*When you know your path, you can lead others too. It’s a*
*small, but powerful tool to keep us on track in all situations.*

We hope that employment with us will be a mutually rewarding experience; however, we also
understand that there are varying circumstances that may cause you to voluntarily resign from Home
Bank. Should you make that decision we ask you to provide us with a Notice of Resignation in

interview with HR, please contact HR to make arrangements. Employees are required to return all
Home Bank property upon termination of employment, including but not limited to: oﬃce keys,
badges, Home Bank manuals, uniforms, cell phone, laptop, company records or documents,
including electronic ﬁles or e-mails, and any other Home Bank owned or issued property. Home
Bank reserves the right to take action through appropriate legal recourse to recoup any replacement
costs and/or seek the return of the property.
