Introduction

This handbook is designed to acquaint you with Buchheit and provide you with information about working
conditions, team member benefits, and some of the policies that affect you.

You should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. The Handbook describes
many of your responsibilities as a team member and outlines the programs we have developed to benefit our
team members. One of our objectives at Buchheit is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both
personal and professional growth.

No team member handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about every one of our policies.
Further, there may be situations where the need arises for us to revise, add, or cancel policies. Therefore,
Buchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The
only exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-at-
will policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will
notify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur.

                           Purpose of Handbook

The contents of this handbook are not intended to create a contract between Buchheit and any or all of its
team members. Rather, this handbook is provided only for the purpose of providing general information
about the company and its policies.

Buchheit reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change any or all such plans, policies or
procedures, in whole or in part, anytime with or without notice. Nothing herein is intended to create any type
of contract or guarantee of continued employment. Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be
discontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice.

                         The Buchheit Story

In 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local
farmers. No superhighways, no GPS units – just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family.

To make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back
home had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy’s efforts were an immediate hit, and
Buchheit Trucking was born.

Several million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with
a network connecting continents around the globe.

The Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores
offer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest.

Yet in spite of our success, we’ve never forgotten the simple principles that drove Rudy back in 1934: get it
there on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it “Rudy’s way.” And no
matter how much farther down the road we go, we’ll never lose sight of it.

                                                                           7 | P a g e

Customer Relations

Customers are Buchheit's most valuable assets. Each team member represents Buchheit to our Customers
and the public. The way we do our jobs presents an image of our entire organization. Customers judge us by
how they are treated each time they have contact with us. Therefore, one of our top business priorities is to
assist any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,
and prompt in the attention you give to customers. This applies to internal, as well as external, customers.

Buchheit will provide customer relations and services training to all team members who have extensive
customer contact. If a customer wishes to make a specific comment or complaint, you should direct that
person to the Manager on Duty for appropriate action. Remember that your contacts with the public in
person, over the telephone, and through all your communications reflect, not only on you, but on Buchheit as
a whole. Positive customer relations will not only enhance the public's image of Buchheit, but also pay off in
greater customer loyalty and increased sales and profit.

                       Buchheit Logistics, Our Promise

At Buchheit, we understand our customers have a choice when it comes to a logistics partner. And we
understand just how much they have riding on their decision. That’s why we make this promise to our
customers: Each and every day we commit to their success. From the first mile to the last, we will stand
with them to ensure that their products are cared for and delivered to their intended destination on time,
as promised. And, if for any reason they are ever dissatisfied, we will spare no effort to make it right.
Thanks for allowing us to serve our customers.


Sincerely,
The Buchheit Logistics Team





                                                                           8 | P a g e

make it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself
have taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today.
I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the
depression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant
loading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education
during these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to
buy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I
did not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25.
My father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first
inventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of
salt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk.
Later, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they
would use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me.
They would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy. In return, they would fill their baskets with goods they bought from me.
Back then, personalized service meant a lot to my customers, as it still does today. Since there was no advertising, the quality of
service was the best way to keep my customers loyal. By word of mouth, people began to learn of my business here.
In the beginning, I lived in the top of the store. In winter, it would get so cold, the soda bottles would freeze. In the summer, we would
open the doors to the stores for a breeze. However, outside was a dirt road, and the dust was so bad, it was almost better to leave the
doors shut.
I didn't have many employees - one or two. Many days, I would run the cash register, load customers in the yard, and talk to
salespeople. Things would get kind of hectic. During the evenings, I would still haul livestock to St. Louis, rent a bed in a rooming
house to sleep for a few hours, and come back home. I worked many 24-hour days.
A salesperson would call me every two weeks. I would order my supplies and would have to pay cash for what I needed right then.
When people would ask for an item, I would try to get it in stock. By filling my customers' needs, I built my inventory up to a business
with a reputation that, "we have everything you need."
If you have noticed, our emblem is a wagon wheel. This represents how teamwork is necessary for progress. The hub, or the center of
the wheel, can be viewed as team members pulling together to get things done, just as the hub holds the spokes together so the wheel
can be put into motion. If one spoke is missing, the wheel cannot work. The same is true for our business. If someone does not
contribute as a team member, our business cannot work. With teamwork, it is difficult to run a business today; however, without
teamwork, it is IMPOSSIBLE and will surely fail. The 11 spokes in this wheel represent each of my children.
Until the early 1960s, I never took a salary: all the profits went back into the business. I have 11 children. Putting food on the table
often meant using the outdated groceries from the store. When I think back, it seemed to be pretty hard work at times, and you didn't
have much time for yourself. But, I would not have done it if I didn't enjoy it.
When my children were big enough to start helping out, they were a big help! With their new ideas, things just seemed to keep
growing. We began to buy a little grain and things in other areas. Our trucking operation expanded to meet our needs, and today, we
are still servicing our customers with a fleet. The feed division has come a long way from the floral print bags. We now manufacture
Premium Brand feeds for the surrounding communities and other custom feeds for a distribution network.
In running this business, I have learned many things. One is that mistakes will be made. I feel that it is important to correct these
mistakes as they arise and to take care of our customers.
Our family has worked by this motto, which has turned into our business motto:
    Rule #1: The customer is always right.
    Rule #2: When in doubt, refer to rule #1.
No matter what your job is here at Buchheit, it is very important that you are honest, have a positive attitude, respect the company, and
respect the inventory, equipment, and the company's customers. These are the main contributions that make your paycheck possible.
I am proud of the history of our company and of the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire Buchheit team. I want you to
take pride in your job and enjoy being part of this team.

Corporate Policies

The ultimate goal of Buchheit is the profitable sale of merchandise and services to our customers. Not all of
you will be engaged in the sale of merchandise, but the following guidelines should be recognized as the
responsibilities of each team member in doing your part to maintain this goal.

1. Do everything possible to make working with Buchheit Logistics easy for our customer.
2.  Recognize the need for a good attendance. You have a job to do and are needed to work your designated
    schedule. Your work is important for you and to Buchheit. When you miss your schedule, the customer
   misses a load, truck maintenance falls behind, customer paperwork suffers, depending on your
   department. A heavier burden is placed on others who work with you.
3.  Whatever your assigned tasks, do them well and contribute to the overall teamwork of your fellow team
   members.  The cooperation of each team member in his or her working relation with other team
   members is a vital contribution to the success of the company.
4. Our image is both friendly and courteous. Generate this atmosphere through your contacts with both
   team members and customers on a day-to-day basis, while on and off duty.
5.  Approach your responsibilities enthusiastically. Your enthusiasm will be a quality to which others
   around you will react. This will create a happier atmosphere for our customers, fellow team members,
   and ultimately for you.
6. Keep your work area clean. This includes your tractor interior, your shop work area, and your desk area.
  Do not walk by a piece of trash or a fallen item. Please stop and pick it up. Help your working team
   members and our customer. With this attitude, you will clearly indicate to those around you that you
    take pride in your job, your company and yourself.
7. Be aware of potential safety hazards. Drive defensively, follow local motor vehicle laws, wear seatbelts.
   Make your area a safer place to work. Help prevent accidents.
8.  Report all accidents to management. Remember, state law requires that you report injuries within 24
    hours. Do not leave work without reporting your injury to your supervisor, or to another manager, if
   needed.
9. Do your best! Each job plays an important role in the overall operation of Buchheit.

Employment Categories
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Understanding the definitions of the employment classifications at Buchheit is important because your
classification is one of the factors that determines your employment status and benefit eligibility. These
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Since employment with
Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment
relationship at will at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. All team members are in an
introductory period during their first 90 days of employment with us.

Depending on your position, you are designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state
wage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT team members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific
provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT team members are excluded from specific provisions of
federal and state wage and hour laws. Your EXEMPT and NONEXEMPT classification may be changed
only with written notification by Buchheit management. In addition to the Exempt and Nonexempt
categories, you also belong to one of the following employment categories:

FULL-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are regularly
scheduled to work the full-time schedule at Buchheit. Generally, regular full-time team members are eligible
for all Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.
Full-time team members need to work 1,560 hours in a calendar year to maintain their full-time status and
retain their benefits.

REGULAR PART-TIME team members are team members who are not in a temporary status AND who are
regularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule, but at least 1,040 hours in a year. Regular
part-time team members are eligible for some Buchheit benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions,
and limitations of each benefit program. Part-time team members who work more than 1,560 hours in a
calendar year will be considered full-time and will be eligible for full-time benefits.

PART-TIME team members are team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per
week. These team members may be employed in a temporary status. While part-time team members receive
all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are
ineligible for the other Buchheit benefit programs.

TEMPORARY team members are team members who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily
supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in
this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond the initially stated period does not in any way
imply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain that status unless, and until, they are
notified of a change. While temporary team members receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social
Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are ineligible for all other Buchheit benefit programs.

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR team members under contract or lease agreement with the company and
are not actual employees of the company. Independent contractors are ineligible for all Buchheit benefit
programs.

                                                                           12 | P a g e

If you have a question or concern about any type of discrimination in the workplace, you are encouraged to
bring the issue to the attention of your supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager. At Buchheit, be assured
that you can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Further, anyone found to be engaging
in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, termination
of employment.

| The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law on July 26, 1990. Its overall purpose is |
| --- |
| to make American Society more accessible to people with disabilities. In 2008, the ADA Amendments |
| Act (ADAAA) was passed, broadening the definition of disability. The ADA's protection applies |
| primarily, but not exclusively, to individuals who meet the ADA's definition of disability. |

Disability Accommodation
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring
equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities.

All employment practices and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Our hiring procedures
have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful employment opportunities. Pre-
employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's ability to perform the duties of the position.

We require post-offer medical examinations for positions that have bona fide job-related physical
requirements. An examination will be given to any person who enters the position but only after being given
a conditional job offer. Medical records are kept separate and confidential.

Reasonable accommodation is available to a team member with a disability if the disability affects the
performance of job functions. We make all employment decisions based on the merits of the situation in
accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual.

Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes
in compensation) as well as job assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions,
lines of progression, and seniority lists. We make leaves of all types available to all team members on an
equal basis.

Buchheit is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified team member or applicant because the
person is related to or associated with a person with a disability. Buchheit will follow any state or local law
that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA.

This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Buchheit is committed to taking all other actions necessary
to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the ADA and all
other applicable federal, state, and local laws.

Essential Job Functions: The Human Resources Department must identify the essential functions of the
position and prepare a job description that lists theses essential functions. The Human Resource Department
is responsible for keeping these job descriptions up-to-date and accessible.

Safety Issues: All employees must comply with safety rules at all times. The company makes every effort
to place applicants and employees in positions for which they are qualified. However, employees and job
applicants are not placed in positions where, with or without a reasonable accommodation, they would create
a direct threat to the safety or health or themselves or others.

The determination that an individual poses a direct safety or health threat must be confirmed by an opinion
in writing from a physician or other appropriate professional.

Drug and Alcohol Use
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit wants to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To meet this goal, we expect you to
report to work in a mental and physical condition that enables you to perform your job in a satisfactory
manner.

While on Buchheit premises or while conducting business-related activities off Buchheit premises, you may
not use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of illegal drugs. We permit the legal use of
prescribed drugs on the job only if they do not impair your ability to perform the essential functions of your
job effectively and safely without endangering others. You must report to your location manager if you have
been prescribed a prescription drug that may impair your ability to perform the essential functions of your
job, and you will not be allowed to operate a forklift, company vehicle, or any motorized equipment.

If you violate this policy, it may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of
your employment. Buchheit has a zero-tolerance policy for any positive drug or alcohol screen results while
conducting business on Buchheit property. If you violate this policy, your employment will be terminated. If
you violate this policy, there could also be legal consequences. Additionally, if you inform your location
manager of an issue with drugs or alcohol before a screening is requested, we may require you to participate
in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program.

If you have questions about substance dependency or abuse, we strongly encourage you to use the resources
of the Employee Assistance Program. You may also wish to discuss these matters with your supervisor or the
Loss Prevention Manager to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate community resources.

A team member with a drug or alcohol problem may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate
in a rehabilitation or treatment program through our health insurance benefit coverage, if the team member's
substance abuse problem has not already resulted in disciplinary action and the team member is not currently
subject to immediate disciplinary action. The time off may be granted if the team member agrees to abstain
from using the problem substance; abides by all Buchheit policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct
in the workplace; and if granting the time off will not cause Buchheit any undue hardship.

A team member must notify Buchheit of a criminal conviction for drug-related activity. The report must be
made within five days of the conviction.

If you have questions about this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use at work, you can raise your
concerns with your supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager without fear of reprisal.

Drug Testing
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all team members.
Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health risks.
To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and team members may be asked to
provide body substance samples (such as urine, breath, and/or blood) to check for the illicit or illegal use of
drugs and alcohol.

Drug testing is required as part of the post-offer, pre-employment process. Drug and alcohol testing
is required for "safety-sensitive" positions under DOT/FMCSA regulations, and for all team members
upon reasonable suspicion. A pending positive test result will result in a suspension until final results
are received. Test results for alcohol or drugs that are positive, or have been tampered with, will
result  in immediate termination of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing will also result in
termination of employment. The cost of any positive drug or alcohol screen will be the responsibility of
the team member and will be deducted from the team member's paycheck.

Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) can provide confidential counseling and referral services to
team members who request assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. We
consider  it the team member's personal responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP before a
disciplinary action is necessitated by problems with the team member's judgment, performance, or
behavior. While we support team members, using the EAP to get assistance, that may not prevent
Buchheit from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all team members. Also, team members will be asked
to sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy.

Team Member Medical Examinations
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

To help us make sure that you are able to perform your duties, Buchheit may require medical
examinations or WorkSTEPS testing of all team members. After we extend an offer to an applicant
entering a designated job, a medical examination or WorkSTEPS test will be performed at our expense by
a health professional of our choice; the offer of employment and assignment to duties is contingent upon
satisfactory completion

Current team members may be required to take medical examinations or WorkSTEPS tests to determine
their fitness for work. If an exam or test is needed, it will be scheduled at a reasonable time and interval and
at our expense. Such testing may be required before a change in work position or upon returning to
work after illness or injury. Refer to Section 6 for further information regarding our return to work
policy.

We consider information about medical conditions or history to be highly confidential and keep  it
separate from other personnel information. Access to  this information  is limited only to persons
who have a legitimate need to know.                                                                           16 | P a g e

As a condition of employment, applicants (and current team members) agree to submit to alcohol and
controlled substance testing upon the request of employer with the following conditions to apply:

1.  All DOT alcohol and controlled substance tests will be completed at a Buchheit Logistics approved
    collection site.
2. When the physician and/or Medical Review Officer (MRO) receives the results of the alcohol/controlled
   substance test, the results will be forwarded to Buchheit Logistics, who may review the results with any
   persons directly involved with the hiring process, officers of the corporation and the corporate attorney.
3.  Applicants testing positive for controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol that are not prescribed by a
    physician will not be considered further for employment or will be dismissed immediately from
   employment. If applicable, the cost of the alcohol/controlled substance test will be deducted from any
   monies that may be owed to the individual.
4. Team members testing positive for any controlled substance, narcotics and/or alcohol will be
   immediately removed from safety-sensitive activities and disciplined up to and including termination of
   employment.

In  addition,  all persons applying  for employment with Buchheit  Logistics  will be  required  to
successfully complete a functional employment test (WorkSTEPS). The cost of this procedure will be paid
by Buchheit Logistics. Below is the process that will be followed:

1.  Applicants should report to the Recruiting Department to complete the necessary application forms.
2.  Authorized team member will interview applicants.
3.  Authorized team member will offer employment to those candidates deemed to be the most qualified and
    suitable for the positions sought. The offers of employment will be contingent upon the successful
   completion of a post offer drug/alcohol screen, functional employment test, and DOT mandated
   background checks.
4. Upon receiving conditional offers of employment, applicants will be given written job descriptions and
    additional written information regarding the post-offer/pre-placement test. After carefully reviewing
    this information and/or consulting with their personal physicians, applicants must complete a
    release authorizing Buchheit and WorkSTEPS to conduct the post-offer functional employment
    tests. Requests for accommodations should be noted on the release.  Depending on the nature
    of the accommodation sought, further discussions and/or medical documentation may be needed to
    identify an appropriate accommodation. Testing will be delayed until the interactive process aimed at
    identifying appropriate and necessary reasonable accommodations is completed.
5. Once the company receives a fully completed release and any requests for reasonable accommodations
    are resolved, the WorkSTEPS post-offer/pre-placement test will be scheduled.
6. Upon reporting to the licensed WorkSTEPS testing facility, applicants will be examined by a licensed
    occupational or physical therapist and their staff.
7.  Applicants who successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be informed of start date
   and time to report for new hire orientation in Scott City, MO.
8.  Applicants who fail to successfully complete the post-offer/pre-placement test will be notified.
   Because Buchheit Logistics seeks to make employment decisions based on the best available objective
   medical evidence, applicants who fail tests should provide any additional information they believe
   Buchheit Logistics should consider before withdrawing its conditional offer of employment.

Additional Points: The cost of the post-offer WorkSTEPS test is paid by Buchheit Logistics.

The introductory period for all new and rehired team members is the first 90 calendar days after the date of
hire. If there is a significant period of absence during the introductory period, the period will automatically
be extended by the length of the absence. Either during the introductory period, or at the end of the period,
we may extend the introductory period if we determine there was not adequate time to evaluate performance.

When the introductory period is satisfactorily completed, team members enter the "regular" employment
classification.

During the introduction period, new team members are eligible for legally required benefits, such as workers'
compensation insurance and Social Security.

After becoming regular team members, they may also be eligible for other Buchheit benefit programs,
subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Be sure to review the information for each
benefits program for the exact eligibility requirements.

Business Ethics and Conduct

Revision Date: 09/01/2016

The successful business operation and reputation of Buchheit is built upon the principles of fair dealing and
ethical conduct of our team members. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance
of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest
standards of conduct and personal integrity.

Our continued success is dependent upon our customers' trust, and we are dedicated to preserving that trust.
Team members owe a duty to Buchheit and our customers to act in ways that will merit the continued trust
and confidence of the public.

As an organization, Buchheit will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and we expect our
directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of
all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.

In general, you should find that using good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you to act
appropriately. If you are unsure about the proper course of action, you should discuss the matter openly with
your supervisor. If necessary, you may also contact the Human Resources Department for advice and
consultation.

It is the responsibility of every Buchheit team member to comply with our policy of business ethics and
conduct.

The introductory period for all new and rehired team members is the first 90 calendar days after the date of
hire. If there is a significant period of absence during the introductory period, the period will automatically
be extended by the length of the absence. Either during the introductory period, or at the end of the period,
we may extend the introductory period if we determine there was not adequate time to evaluate performance.

When the introductory period is satisfactorily completed, team members enter the "regular" employment
classification.

During the introduction period, new team members are eligible for legally required benefits, such as workers'
compensation insurance and Social Security.

After becoming regular team members, they may also be eligible for other Buchheit benefit programs,
subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Be sure to review the information for each
benefits program for the exact eligibility requirements.

Business Ethics and Conduct
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

The successful business operation and reputation of Buchheit is built upon the principles of fair dealing and
ethical conduct of our team members. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance
of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest
standards of conduct and personal integrity.

Our continued success is dependent upon our customers' trust, and we are dedicated to preserving that trust.
Team members owe a duty to Buchheit and our customers to act in ways that will merit the continued trust
and confidence of the public.

As an organization, Buchheit will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and we expect our
directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of
all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.

In general, you should find that using good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you to act
appropriately. If you are unsure about the proper course of action, you should discuss the matter openly with
your supervisor. If necessary, you may also contact the Human Resources Department for advice and
consultation.

It is the responsibility of every Buchheit team member to comply with our policy of business ethics and
conduct.

Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary
action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

Team Member Relations
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 04/05/2013

We believe that the work conditions, wages, and benefits we offer to Buchheit team members are
competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If you have concerns
about work conditions or compensations, you are strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and
directly to your supervisor.

Our experience has shown that when team members deal openly and directly with management, the work
environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that
Buchheit amply demonstrates its commitment to team members by responding effectively to team member
concerns. Because we want to maintain direct employer/team member communications, we do not believe
our team members need an outside party to speak for them and will continue to protect your right to speak
for yourself.

Personal Relationships in the Workplace
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

The employment of relatives of individuals involved in a dating relationship in the same area of an
organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and team member morale. In addition
to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be
carried over into day-to-day working relationships. This policy applies to all team members regardless of
their gender or sexual orientation.

For purposes of this policy, a relative is defined as any person who is related to you by blood or marriage, or
whose relationship with you is similar to that of a relative. A dating relationship is defined as a relationship
that may be reasonably expected to lead to the formation of a consensual "romantic" or sexual relationship.

You may not be involved in a dating relationship with a team member who either works directly for you or
supervises you. Buchheit reserves the right to take prompt action if an actual or potential conflict of interest
arises involving relatives or individuals involved in a dating relationship who occupy positions at any level
(higher or lower) in the same line of authority that might affect the review of employment decisions.

If two people who are in a reporting situation described above subsequently develop a dating relationship,
the person in the relationship who is the supervisor is responsible and obligated to disclose the existence of
the relationship to management. We will decide which one of them is to be transferred to another available
location. If the team member is not willing to be transferred to another location, they may be terminated.

If there is a situation where a conflict, or the potential for conflict, arises because of the relationship between
team members, even if there is no line of authority or reporting involved, the team members may be
separated by reassignment or termination of employment. If in a close personal relationship with another
team member, we ask that you refrain from displays of affection or excessive personal conversation at work.

Conflicts of Interest
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

As a team member of Buchheit, you have the obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit
actual or potential conflicts of interest. In this policy, Buchheit is establishing the framework within which
we operate. These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further
clarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the
Company President or the Chief Executive Officer.

An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision
that may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with
Buchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or
marriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood
or marriage.

There is no "presumption of guilt" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.
However, if you have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative
that you disclose this fact to an officer of Buchheit as soon as possible. By alerting us to the existence of any
actual or even a potential conflict of interest, we can establish safeguards to protect all parties.

The potential for personal gain is not limited to situations where a team member or relative has a significant
ownership in a firm with which Buchheit does business. Personal gains can also result from situations where
a team member or relative receives a kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of a
transaction or business dealings involving Buchheit.

Company drivers are not allowed to have direct ownership in over-the-road equipment and are not
allowed to invest in a company which operates in motor carrier transportation, where the employee has
any direct or indirect involvement in the operations of such company.

Outside Employment
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit team members may hold outside jobs as long as they can satisfactorily perform their Buchheit job
and there is no interference with our scheduling demands.

All team members will be held to the same standards of performance and scheduling expectations, regardless
of any outside job. If we determine that outside work is impacting your performance or the ability to meet
our requirements, which may change over time, you will be asked to terminate the outside job in order to
stay employed at Buchheit.

We prohibit outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest. Further, you may not receive any
income or material gain from individuals outside Buchheit for materials produced or services rendered while
performing your job.

To help us keep records and benefit program information accurate, we need mailing address, telephone
numbers, your marital status, changes to your dependents' information, who to contact in case of an
emergency, educational accomplishments, and other possibly relevant information.

The employee or independent contractor is responsible for updating their personal information via the
current HR/Payroll system online (currently www.workforcenow.adp.com) for any change in status,
such as name, address, phone number, marital status, etc. Contact the Payroll or Human Resources

The best communications about job performance happen on an informal, day-to-day basis. You and your
supervisor are strongly encouraged to talk about performance regularly.

Formal written performance evaluations will be conducted at the end of the initial period of hire, known as
the introductory period. In addition, Buchheit wants to ensure that you and your supervisor have scheduled,
formal performance evaluations. These discussions give you both the opportunity to discuss job
responsibilities and goals, encourage and recognize strengths, identify and correct any weaknesses, develop
plans for dealing with any obstacles, and plan for the future.

Personal Appearance
Effective Date: 03/23/2009

you dress, your grooming, and personal cleanliness standards all contribute to that image and also to the
morale of your co-workers.

During business hours or whenever representing Buchheit, you are expected to present a clean, neat, and
tasteful appearance. You should always dress and groom yourself according to the requirements of your
position and accepted social standards. This is particularly true if your job involves dealing in person with
customers or visitors.

Your supervisor or department head is responsible for establishing a reasonable dress code appropriate to the
job you perform. If your supervisor feels your personal appearance is inappropriate, you may be asked to
leave work until you can return properly dressed or groomed.

If this happens, you will not be paid for the time away from work. Be sure to consult your supervisor if you
have questions as to what constitutes appropriate appearance. Because personal style can be important to
people, we do not want to restrict individual tastes unnecessarily.

Wage Administration
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 04/05/2013

The wage administration program at Buchheit was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with
federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive
wages within our labor market. Because we believe that recruiting and retaining talented team members is
critical to our success, we are committed to paying our team members equitable wages that reflect the
requirements and responsibilities of their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly
situated team members at the same performance level in other organizations in the area.

Compensation for every position is determined by several factors including the essential duties and
responsibilities of the job, the team member's performance, and wage survey data on pay practices of other
employers. We periodically review our wage administration program and restructure it as necessary.

Timekeeping
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Nonexempt team members are responsible for accurately recording the hours they work. This information
also helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of "time worked" in order
to correctly calculate team members pay and benefits.

"Time worked" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties.

If you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as
well as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for
personal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours.

Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special
circumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device.

We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following
actions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with
time records, or recording another team member's time record.

If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your
scheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled
ending time.

Wage Administration

Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 04/05/2013

The wage administration program at Buchheit was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with
federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive
wages within our labor market. Because we believe that recruiting and retaining talented team members is
critical to our success, we are committed to paying our team members equitable wages that reflect the
requirements and responsibilities of their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly
situated team members at the same performance level in other organizations in the area.

Compensation for every position is determined by several factors including the essential duties and
responsibilities of the job, the team member's performance, and wage survey data on pay practices of other
employers. We periodically review our wage administration program and restructure it as necessary.

Timekeeping
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Nonexempt team members are responsible for accurately recording the hours they work. This information
also helps Buchheit comply with the laws that require us to keep accurate records of "time worked" in order
to correctly calculate team members pay and benefits.

"Time worked" is defined as all the time nonexempt staff spend performing assigned duties.

Tf you are a nonexempt team member, you must accurately record the time you begin and end your work, as
well as the beginning and ending time of any meal periods, split shifts, or if you leave the workplace for
personal reasons. Also, you always need to receive advance approval before working any overtime hours.

Team members are required to clock-in/out on-site via Paycom. Only team members with special
circumstance are authorized by management to clock-in/out remotely via mobile device.

We consider attempts to falsify timekeeping records a very serious matter. Therefore, any of the following
actions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination: altering, falsifying, tampering with
time records, or recording another team member's time record.

If you are a nonexempt team member, you should not start working more than five minutes before your
scheduled starting time. You should also not continue working more than five minutes after your scheduled

ending time.

The only time you can start earlier or work later than your scheduled hours is with prior authorization from
your supervisor.

Tf corrections or revisions are made to the time record, both the team member and supervisor must approve
the changes on the time record as being accurate.

Paydays
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

All team members are paid biweekly. Each paycheck includes earnings for all work performed through the
end of the previous payroll period.

If you are going to be on vacation on a payday, your paycheck will be available upon your return.

We also offer the option of having your pay directly deposited into your bank account once you provide
the required  information  (account number  and  bank’s  routing  number)  to  your ADP  profile
at www.workforcenow.adp.com.

When you select direct deposit, you receive an itemized electronic statement of wages on paydays instead of
a paycheck. Direct deposit is required, unless exempt by law under your state of residence. Buchheit will not
be responsible for any delays in delivery of paychecks to locations.

Administrative Pay Corrections
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit takes all reasonable steps to ensure that you receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and
that you are paid on the scheduled payday.

In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay you receive, you should promptly advise the
Payroll Department so that the discrepancy can be corrected as quickly as possible.

Pay Deductions and Setoffs
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is legally required to make certain deductions from every team member's compensation. Among
these deductions are federal, state, and local taxes as appropriate. We are also legally required to deduct
Social Security taxes on your earnings up to a maximum amount, which is called the Social Security "wage
base". Buchheit contributes to your Social Security by matching the amount of Social Security taxes
deducted from your compensation.

Buchheit offers programs and benefits to eligible team members beyond those required by law. You may
voluntarily authorize deductions from your paycheck to cover your portion of the cost of these programs.

We may be legally required to take "pay setoffs" from your paycheck. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken
by Buchheit, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to us or to others.

If you have questions concerning why a deduction was made from your paycheck or how your paycheck is
calculated, consult with your supervisor.

Work Schedules
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Work schedules for team members vary throughout Buchheit. Your supervisor will advise you of your
specific work schedule. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and
ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week.

Break and Meal Periods
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Break periods will be allowed according to the schedule below. To the extent possible, break periods will be
in the middle of work periods. Meal periods are required according to the schedule below.

Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. During meal periods, you
will be relieved of all work responsibilities and restrictions and will not be compensated for that time.

• Team members scheduled 5 hours or less - One 15-minute break
• Team members scheduled between 5 1/2 and 6 1/2 hours - One 30-minute lunch
• Team members scheduled between 7 and 8 1/2 hours - One 15-minute break and one 30-minute lunch
• Team members scheduled 9 hours or more - One 15-minute break and one 60-minute lunch

Retail delivery drivers are required to take a 30-minute lunch each day, and OTR drivers are required a
minimum of a 30-minute rest/break period per DOT regulations which should serve as lunch.

There may be exceptions to the above lunch schedule during certain situations such as store inventories,
special promotions or special business needs, according to manager's discretion.

Overtime
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

There may be times when Buchheit cannot meet its operating requirements or other needs during regular
working hours. If this happens, we may give team members the opportunity to volunteer for overtime work
assignments. Overtime is considered over 40-hours in the work week, however; drivers who transport
“interstate” freight may be excepted from overtime requirements.

It is our policy that no overtime can be worked without the approval and authorization of the supervisor. We
try to distribute overtime among all team members who are qualified to perform the required work.

All nonexempt team members will be paid overtime compensation in accordance with federal and state wage
and hour restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. For this reason, time off for sick leave,
vacation, and other paid or unpaid leaves of absence is not considered hours worked for the purpose of
calculating overtime pay.

If you work overtime without receiving your supervisor's prior authorization, you may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

Attendance and Punctuality
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 11/01/2012

As a team member of Buchheit, we expect you to be reliable and punctual by reporting for work on time and
as scheduled. When you are absent or late, it places a burden on other team members and can impact
productivity and service.

In the rare instances when you cannot avoid being late or are unable to work as scheduled, be sure to notify
the location manager on duty, verbally, as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
You as a team member of Buchheit are responsible to make the notification. Buchheit will in turn have the
team members’ schedules posted in the team member break room for the current week and the upcoming
week.

Because unplanned absences can be disruptive to work, a poor attendance record or excessive lateness may
lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. As stated in the Attendance Point
system below, you as a team member, may have the following points deducted from your yearly (based on a
calendar year) total of 8-points for absences that are unapproved.

The Attendance Point system is effective for all scheduled hourly team members in all retail store locations
and the Corporate Offices.

Attendance Point System Chart:
•  Each Absence = 1 point (Absence is defined as arriving to work two hours past your scheduled shift or
   your entire shift without a doctor’s note.)
•  Each late in (tardy) or early out = ½ point (Late in is defined as 10 minutes past scheduled shift and early
    out is defined as leaving before the entire shift is completed and is unapproved by management.)
•  Each Weekend Day Absence = 2-points per day (Each weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) absences is
    defined by missing your entire shift without a doctor’s note. And any absence of three scheduled days or
   more without a doctor’s note.)
•  Each Holiday Absence = 2-points per day. Holidays are defined in policy Holidays, and also include
    business holidays such as Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving).
•  Each no call/no show for work = 4-points (No call/no show is defined as a team member not calling or
   showing up for a scheduled shift.)

If a team member reaches accumulated point according to the Disciplinary Action chart below, defined
action will take place. All accumulated points will be reviewed on a weekly basis. Disciplinary Action:
   •  3 points = verbal counseling w/Personal Assistance Service Information (PAS)
   •  4 points = written counseling
   •  6 points = written counseling
   •  7 points = written counseling including final notice
   •  8 points = termination of employment

activities during working time. (Working time excludes lunch periods, work breaks, or any other time when

Workplace Etiquette
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit strives to maintain a positive work environment where team members treat each other with respect
and courtesy. Sometimes, issues can arise when team members may be unaware that their behavior at work
may be disruptive or annoying to others.

Very often you can address these day-to-day issues by politely talking with your co-worker to bring the
perceived problem to his or her attention.

In most cases, common sense will dictate an appropriate resolution. Buchheit encourages all team members
to keep an open mind and graciously accept constructive feedback or another team member's request for you
to change your behavior because it may be affecting that person's ability to concentrate and be productive.

The following are some workplace etiquette guidelines and suggestions to help you be more conscientious
and considerate of your co-workers and the work environment. These are not necessarily intended to be hard
and fast work rules with disciplinary consequences.

• Avoid public accusations or criticisms of other team members.
•  Address issues privately with those involved or your supervisor.
•  Try to minimize unscheduled interruptions of other team members while they are working.
• Communicate by email or phone whenever possible, instead of walking unexpectedly into someone's
   office or workspace.
• Be conscious of how your voice travels and try to lower the volume of your voice when talking on the
  phone or to others in open areas.
• Keep socializing to a minimum and try to conduct conversations in areas where the noise will not be
   distracting to others.
•  Minimize talking between workspaces or over cubicle walls. Instead, conduct conversations with others
   in their workspace.
•  Try not to block walkways while carrying on conversations.
•  Refrain from using inappropriate language (swearing) that others may overhear.
• Avoid discussions of your personal life/issues in public conversations that can be easily overheard.
•  Monitor the volume when listening to music, voice mail, or a speakerphone that others can hear.
•  Clean up after yourself and do not leave behind waste of discarded papers.
•  Return copy machine and printer settings to their default settings after changing them.
•  Replace paper in the copy machine and printer trays when they are empty.
•  Retrieve print jobs in a timely manner and be sure to collect all your pages.
• Keep the area around the copy machine and printers’ orderly and picked up.
• Be careful not to take or discard others' print jobs or faxes when collecting your own.

If you have comments, concerns, or suggestions about workplace etiquette, contact a local Manager.

Buchheit provides cellular telephones to some team members as business tools. The phones are provided to
assist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other
business-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,
brief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit
issued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality.

Company provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the
team member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for
replacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being
eligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility
window, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also
responsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services.

Buchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list
accessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded
applications to company provided cell phones.

While driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that
reason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You
should utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or
talk on the phone.

If you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your
conversations private and non-disruptive to others.

The use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited.

    1.  First and Last name
    2.  Address
    3. Work telephone number
    4. Work e-mail address
    5. Home telephone number
    6.  General educational credentials

Employees are reminded that safeguarding sensitive information is a critical responsibility that must be
taken seriously at all times. Company policy specifies the following security policies for the protection
of PII and other sensitive data:
    •    It is the responsibility of the individual user to protect data to which they have access.
    •  Employees having access to personal information shall respect the confidentiality of such
       information, and refrain from any conduct that would indicate a careless or negligent attitude
      toward such information. Employees also shall avoid office gossip and should not permit any
       unauthorized viewing of records. Only individuals who have a "need to know" in their official
       capacity shall have access to such records.

The loss of PII can result in substantial harm to individuals, including identity theft or other fraudulent
use of the information. Because employees may have access to personal identifiable information
concerning individuals and other sensitive data, we have a special responsibility to protect that
information from loss and misuse. With these responsibilities employees should:
    •  Safeguard information to which the employee has access at all times.
    •  Obtain management's written approval prior to taking any sensitive information away from the
        office. The manager's approval must identify the business necessity for removing such

Problem Solving Process
We encourage team members to work out any problems they have with their peers and their immediate
supervisors on a one-to-one basis. If you believe your problem is not adequately addressed, you may take the
problem to any supervisor/manager in your line of authority.

If you are unable to work out problems informally, you may briefly describe the problem in writing and
submit it to the corporate loss prevention department. Appropriate personnel will be assigned to look into
the problem and attempt to resolve it completely. Management will respond to the problem by the team
member’s next workday (Mon.-Fri.). If you are not satisfied with the resolution, you may discuss the
problem with senior corporate management.

You must call the attention of management to the problem within 30 calendar days of its occurrence. If you
believe you are experiencing sexual harassment, you may raise this problem in the same manner as for any
other problem, except that you have 180 calendar days.

When attempting to resolve a problem in person, two company representatives or members of management
must be present.

Open Door Policy
Any applicant or employee who believes that there has been a violation of company policy or any applicable
law relating to accommodating a person with a disability should immediately contact the Human Resource

We also believe that it is in the best interests of Buchheit to ensure fair treatment of all team members and
make certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any
disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the team member for
satisfactory performance in the future.

Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to
terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive
discipline at its discretion.

Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or
without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of
occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.

Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be
followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;
another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of
employment.

Buchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify
either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual
progressive discipline steps.

While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee
Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or
termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be
examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline.

By using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early
stage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit.

Problem Resolution

Buchheit is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for our team members. Part of this
commitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or
question receives a timely response from Buchheit supervisors and management.

Buchheit strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members. We expect supervisors, managers,
and team members to treat each other with mutual respect. We encourage team members to offer positive
and constructive criticism to each other.

If you disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, you can express your concern
through the problem resolution procedure. You will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a
complaint with Buchheit in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution
procedure.

Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to
terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive
discipline at its discretion.

Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or
without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of
occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.

Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be
followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;
another offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of
employment.

Buchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify
either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual
progressive discipline steps.

While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee
Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or
termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be
examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline.

By using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early
stage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit.

Problem Resolution

Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for our team members. Part of this
commitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or
question receives a timely response from Buchheit supervisors and management.

Buchheit strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members. We expect supervisors, managers,
and team members to treat each other with mutual respect. We encourage team members to offer positive
and constructive criticism to each other.

If you disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, you can express your concern
through the problem resolution procedure. You will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a
complaint with Buchheit in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution
procedure.

If a situation occurs when you believe that a condition of employment or a decision affecting you is unjust or
inequitable, you are encouraged to make use of the following steps. You may discontinue the procedure at
any step.
1. You present the problem to your supervisor within 30 calendar days after the incident occurs. If your
    supervisor is unavailable or you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, you may present
    the problem to the Loss Prevention Manager or any other member of management.
2. The supervisor responds to the problem during discussion or within 30 calendar days after consulting
   with appropriate management, when necessary. The supervisor documents the discussion.
3. You present the problem to the Loss Prevention Manager within 30 calendar days if the problem is
    unresolved.
4. The Loss Prevention Manager counsels and advises you, assists you in putting the problem in writing,
    visits with your supervisor/managers, if necessary, and directs you to the Director of Stores for a review
    of the problem.
5. You present the problem to the Director of Stores in writing.
6. The Director of Stores reviews and considers the problem. The Director of Stores informs you of the

    appropriate to resolve the problem.

Not every problem can be resolved to everyone's total satisfaction, but only through understanding and
discussion of mutual problems can team members and management develop confidence in each other. This
confidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment and helps to
ensure everyone's job security.

Workplace Violence Prevention
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. We
have adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual)
violence that might occur during business hours or on our premises.

All team members, including supervisors and temporary team members, should be treated with courtesy and
respect at all times. Team members are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay", or other conduct that
may be dangerous to others. We prohibit firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices and
substances from the premises of Buchheit without proper authorization.

Buchheit will not tolerate conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer,
or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods. This includes all acts of harassment,
including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, national origin, disability, religion, or
any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

All threats of (or actual) violence, either direct or indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your
supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by team members as well as threats by
customers, vendors, solicitors, or anyone else. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific
and detailed as possible.

Be sure to report any suspicious person or activities as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place
yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work area, do not try to intercede
or see what is happening.

We will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats (or actual), bullying or violence and of
suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the person who made the report will be protected to the
extent practical. To maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Buchheit may suspend a
team member, either with or without pay, pending investigation.

Any person who violates these guidelines will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment. Violations include making a threat of violence or actually committing a violent
act.

Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Buchheit is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of harassment and
discrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual
harassment. This policy applies to all employees of the company, including supervisors and non-supervisory
employees, and independent contractors.

In keeping with this commitment, the company maintains a strict policy prohibiting harassment or
discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental and/or physical
disability, national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law. This includes any form of verbal,
non-verbal, physical, and visual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an
individual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other
legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. We provide ongoing sexual harassment training to
ensure you the opportunity to work in an environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment.

Moreover, it is the policy of the company to prevent and prohibit misconduct on the job, including
sexual harassment or any other type of harassment or discrimination by co-workers, other employees,
including supervisors, and persons doing business with or for the company.

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other offensive conduct of a sexual nature do not
belong in the workplace. In addition, a hostile or offensive work environment caused by remarks or actions
based on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, gender, age, marital status, veteran status, sexual
orientation, any physical or mental disability or any other classification that is protected under applicable
law, will not be condoned or permitted. Such conduct could constitute harassment, which is not only a
violation of Company policy, but also violate the law.

It is important to remember that actions or comments you may consider to be innocent or harmless may be
considered offensive physical or verbal harassment by another employee, driver, or contractor. In addition,
under some circumstances, a violation of the Company’s E-Mail, Internet, and Mobilecomm Policy may also
constitute harassment.

If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical
harassment, or there are other interpersonal issues which compromise the working environment, or which
create discord or distractions that interfere with your safety and productivity, the driver should immediately
notify his or her supervisor, or contact the Human Resources Department, so that the company may
investigate the situation. If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to
verbal or physical harassment during training, the employee should immediately contact his or her supervisor
to inform them of the situation.

Harassment and/or discrimination may take many forms including but not limited to:
A) Any discriminatory or harassing action based on one’s protected characteristic (race, citizenship,
    color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, and/or disability) that has the purpose or effect of
   unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or adversely effecting an
    individual’s employment opportunities.
B) Such verbal, non-verbal, discriminatory, or harassing actions that create a hostile work environment.
    These may include but are not limited to:
   o  Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual advances,
        invitations, or comments.
   o  Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings, or gestures.
   o  Physical conduct such as assault, blocking normal movement, or interference with work, when

Although sexual harassment typically involves co-workers, it can also include third parties, such as
customers or suppliers.  It is imperative that you immediately report any behavior, which you deem to be
sexually harassing so the company can take immediate action and investigate the complaint.

Team Member Responsibilities:
If employee or independent contractor believes that they have been subject to sexual harassment or any

•  Make a written record of the date, time, and nature of the incident (s) and the names of any witness;
   and
•  Report the incident to their supervisor or directly to the Human Resources Department.

Resignation
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 03/18/2011

Resignation is defined as a voluntary act initiated by a team member to terminate employment with
Buchheit. Although there is no requirement that you give advance notice, doing so can reduce the impact on
your co-workers and productivity. We request a resigning team member submit a written notice of
resignation at least two weeks in advance. Vacation pay may be withheld without two-weeks’ notice, subject
to state law. Vacation time may not be included as part of the two-week notice.

Before a team member leaves, we will schedule an off-site exit interview to better understand the reasons for
resignation and to go over any resulting benefit changes.

Employment Termination
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of
the reasons for termination are routine. These are some of the most common circumstances for employment
terminations:
• FMLA leave expires - failure to perform active work for more than twelve weeks.
•  Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by a team member.
•  Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization.
•  Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for non-disciplinary reasons.
•  Retirement - voluntary employment termination initiated by the team member meeting age, length of
   service, and any other criteria for retirement from the organization.

We will generally schedule an exit interview at the time of employment termination. The exit interview is an
opportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of any outstanding
debt to Buchheit, or return of Buchheit-owned property. It is also a time for you to voice any suggestions,
complaints, and questions you may have. Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent,
either you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause
or advance notice, at any time.

Your benefits are affected by termination in several ways. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and
payable at termination will be paid out. Some benefits may be continued at your expense if you choose. You
will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations
for continuing them.

Termination Date
If an employee or independent contractor fails to report to work at the normally scheduled time, or a
driver abandons a truck, their termination date is the last day they worked.  If an employee is on
Worker’s Compensation, short-term disability, military leave or Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and
is released to return to work and fails to report, their termination date is the date they were released to
return to work.

Vacation Benefits
 Effective Date: 03/23/2009
 Revision Date: 03/18/2011

 Buchheit offers vacation time off with pay to eligible team members for rest, relaxation, and personal
 pursuits. Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:
 •  Full-time team members
 •  Regular part-time team members

 Full-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in
 the following schedule:
•  After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year.
•  After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year.
•  After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year.

 Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be
 eligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the
 preceding two calendar years.

The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a "calendar year". A " calendar year" is defined as
 the 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended
 for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the
 benefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information.

Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the
 schedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued.

You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should
 request the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will
 be reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements.

 Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations
 are granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may
 apply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence.

 Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any
 special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers
 vacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years’ earnings.

We encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the
 event that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused
 time.

 If your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through
 your last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements.

                                                                           53 | P a g e

Unpaid Time Off Policy
Effective 12/08/2020

All team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment. When unpaid time
off is requested for personal reasons, a team member’s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid
time off can be requested.

Unpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number
of consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than
three (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave
of absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence.

Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as
the benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit
Retirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and
employer contributions to the plan.

Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)
weeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to
properly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be
waived in emergency situations.

Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and
communicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks
prior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing
and budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar
year. If request is considered excessive more than 10 days in a calendar year the request maybe denied.
Requests may be approved or denied on the basis of these or other reasonable considerations.

Team members who are absent from work without approval of their supervisor may be subject to disciplinary
action accordance with Attendance and Punctuality Policy.

Also, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday
immediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday.

If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or
vacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have
applied.

If eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday
pay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday.

A holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team
members. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday.

Paid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime.
Payment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday.

It is critical that you inform your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless
of how minor it might appear at the time. Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for
workers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly.
Failure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.

You must report any injury to the Workers’ Compensation Department within 8 hours.

No action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees’ behalf until the Safety Department has been
notified.

Drivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties
required of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and
performing pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal
vehicle to and from work.

Workers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither
Buchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for
injuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activities that we may sponsor.

The Safety Department must be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The
Company will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for
emergency situations).  If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the
medical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the
United States.

Each Workers’ Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed
compensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired.
Your weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage. This means the weekly
benefits may be significantly less than your net pay. You should also note there is a minimum waiting
period of 3 days (depending on the state Workers’ Compensation laws) before the weekly benefits goes
into effect. This translates into a week or two without income. The calculation of your weekly benefit
and the waiting period is not a policy set by the company but rather by state laws.

Your claim may be administered, and benefits paid to you by a third-party administrator.

The Company will offer modified duty work to drivers who sustain work injuries if the treating
physician feels the driver is capable of modified duty work. Injured drivers will be offered modified
duty work that will meet their physical capabilities. Modified duty work is intended as rehabilitation and
should be temporary only.

If your claim is investigated and found to be fraudulent, benefits will be denied, and internal disciplinary
actions will be taken.  If deemed appropriate, legal action may also be taken. A preventable on the job

MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS

It is critical that you inform your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless
of how minor it might appear at the time. Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for
workers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly.
Failure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.

You must report any injury to the Workers’ Compensation Department within 8 hours.

No action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees’ behalf until the Safety Department has been
notified.

Drivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties
required of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and
performing pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal
vehicle to and from work.

Workers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither
Buchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for
injuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activities that we may sponsor.

The Safety Department must be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The
Company will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for
emergency situations). If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the
medical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the
United States.

Each Workers’ Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed
compensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired.
Your weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage. This means the weekly
benefits may be significantly less than your net pay. You should also note there is a minimum waiting
period of 3 days (depending on the state Workers’ Compensation laws) before the weekly benefits goes
into effect. This translates into a week or two without income. The calculation of your weekly benefit
and the waiting period is not a policy set by the company but rather by state laws.

Your claim may be administered, and benefits paid to you by a third-party administrator.

The Company will offer modified duty work to drivers who sustain work injuries if the treating
physician feels the driver is capable of modified duty work. Injured drivers will be offered modified
duty work that will meet their physical capabilities. Modified duty work is intended as rehabilitation and
should be temporary only.

Tf your claim is investigated and found to be fraudulent, benefits will be denied, and internal disciplinary

actions will be taken. If deemed appropriate, legal action may also be taken. A preventable on the job
injury may disqualify a driver from the Safety Award program.

In the event an injury results in time away from work, drivers will be responsible for making regular
contact regarding their status with their supervisor and the Safety Department.  It is very critical to the
handling of a claim that the driver keeps the Safety Department informed of his/her medical status.

It is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on Worker’s
Compensation that would normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or
before the first day of the coverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the
attention of the Corporate Payroll Department. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage.

While the company cannot guarantee it will hold open an employee’s regular job during an extended
period of leave, or while an employee is performing modified duty work, the Company will consider the
physicians estimated length of absence from the employee’s regular job in determining whether the
employee will be permitted to return to work.

In accordance with the provisions of Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Workers’
Compensation time off is applied toward FMLA leave allowance, if eligible for FMLA. If not eligible
for FMLA, then a request for a Leave of Absence may be considered.

Time Off to Vote
Effective Date: 03/23/2009

we will grant up to three hours of unpaid time off to vote.

Illinois team members will receive two hours of paid time off to vote if their scheduled work day starts less
than two hours after voting time begins and ends less than two hours before voting time ends. The team
member will be required to submit a voter's receipt.

In order to accommodate your absence, you should request the time off from your supervisor at least two
working days prior to an election day.

Bereavement Leave

In the event that you need to take time off in the event of the death of a family member, Buchheit
provides bereavement leave. To request bereavement leave, see your supervisor for the proper form.
Documentation is required to be submitted with the form. We grant up to three days of paid bereavement
leave to all team members.

During paid bereavement leave, your pay will be calculated based on your pay rate at the time of
absence, excluding any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or
shift differentials. Bereavement leave will only be paid for those days that you are scheduled to work.

                                                                           57 | P a g e

leave policy defines "immediate family" as your spouse, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, brother,
sister, step-brother, step-sister, spouse's parent or spouse's step-parent.

We grant up to one day of paid leave for the death of an extended family member. The bereavement

leave. If you remain on jury duty beyond the period of paid jury duty leave, you may use any available paid
time off, such as vacation time, or request an unpaid jury duty leave of absence.

If you receive a jury duty summons, show it to your supervisor as soon as possible so that arrangements can

Military Reserve Leave
An employee who remains in the active military reserve will be allowed time off work for the required
reserve training. This time will be without company compensation but will not be in place of earned

The employee may use vacation time for military duty. The Company will pay the normal company
group insurance contributions during the leave of absence for military reserve training.

Sickness
An employee who misses work due to illness may be required to provide a doctor’s note. After an

of other disabilities, we will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal requirements, to
allow qualified team members with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs.

Medical information on individual team members is treated confidentially. Buchheit will take reasonable
precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure.

Supervisor/managers and other team members have a responsibility to respect and maintain the

Family and Medical Leave Policy

I.  Purpose: To outline the conditions under which an employee may request time off without pay for a
    limited period with job protection and no loss of accumulated service if the employee returns to work.

II. Definition: A family or medical leave of absence is defined as an approved absence available to eligible
   employees for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year under particular circumstances that are critical to
    the life of a family.

Leave may be taken:
   •  on the birth of an employee’s child;
   •  on the placement of a child for adoption or foster care with an employee;
   •  when an employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;
       or
   •  when an employee is unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of his or her position
       because of the employee’s own serious health condition.

A “serious health condition” is one that requires inpatient or residential care or continuing treatment by a
health care provider. “Continuing treatment” includes two or more treatments by a health care provider
followed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider.  It also
includes treatment of pregnancy or prenatal care, treatment of a chronic health condition of a serious nature,
treatment of a long-term or permanent health condition for which the family member must be under
continuing supervision of a health care provider, or any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a
health care provider either for restorative surgery or a condition, which if untreated, would result in an
incapacity of more than three days.

For the purpose of this policy, a "serious health condition" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:
• Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
   hospice, or residential medical care facility; or
• A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or any other
   regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health
   care provider; or
• Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care; or
• A period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma,
   diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); or
• Any absences to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by, or on
   referral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three
   consecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).

For the purpose of this policy, health care providers who may provide certification of a serious health
condition include:
•  Doctor of Medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State
   in which the doctor practices
•  Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists and chiropractors (limited to treatment consisting

A team member's spouse, children (son or daughter), and parents are immediate family member for purposes
of FMLA. The term "parent" does not include a parent "in-law". The terms son or daughter do not include
individuals age 18 or over unless they are "incapable of self-care" because of a mental or physical disability
that limits one or more of the "major life activities" as those terms are defined in regulations issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

III. Scope: This policy applies to all family and medical leaves of absence except leaves covered under paid
   employment benefit plans or polices for any part of the 12 weeks’ leave to which the employees may be
    entitled under this policy. In other words, if an employee is entitled to both FMLA (Family and Medical
   Leave Act) and paid leave under another benefit plan or policy, the employee must take the paid leave
     first.

IV. Eligibility: To be eligible for leave under this policy, an employee must have been employed here for at
    least 12 months and must have worked at least 1250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the
   beginning of the leave. While on leave your time vested is protected, and you will not lose any benefits
   accrued prior to the date the leave began (except any accrued paid leave that you are required to exhaust).

Exception:  If an employee on leave is salaried and among the highest paid 10% of Company employees
within 75 surface miles and keeping the job open for the employee would result in substantial and serious
economic injury to the Company, the employee can be denied job restoration after leave. In this situation,
however, the employee will be given an opportunity to return to work during leave.

V. Basic Regulations and Conditions of Leave:  Medical certification. The Company will require
   medical certification to support a claim for leave for an employee’s own serious health condition or to
    care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. For the employee’s own medical leave, the certification
   must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform at least one of the functions of his or her
    position. For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certification must include an
    estimate of the amount of time that the employee is needed to provide one.

Covered employers must take the following steps to provide information to team members about FMLA:
•  Post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining rights and responsibilities under FMLA
•  Include information about team member rights and obligations under FMLA in team member handbooks
   or other written material, including Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs)
•  If handbooks or other written materials do not exist, provide general written guidance about team member
   rights and obligation under FMLA whenever a team member requests leave

•  Provide a written notice designating the leave as FMLA leave and detailing specific expectations and
   obligations of a team member who is exercising his/her FMLA entitlements. The team member may use
   the "Employer Response to Employee Request for Family or Medical Leave" to meet this requirement.
   This employer notice should be provided to the team member within one or two business days after
   receiving the team members notice of need for leave and include the following:
   o  That the leave will be counted against the team member's annual FMLA leave entitlement
   o  Any requirements for the team member to furnish medical certification and the consequences of
        failing to do so
   o  The team member's right to elect to use accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave and whether the
      employer will require the use of paid leave, and the conditions related to using paid leave
   o  Any requirement of the team member to make co-premium payments for maintaining group
       insurance and the arrangements for making such payments
   o  Any requirements to present fitness-for-duty certification before being restored to his/her job
   o  Rights to job restoration upon return from leave
   o  Team member's potential liability for reimbursement of health insurance premiums paid by the
      employer during the leave if the team member fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave
   o  Whether the team member qualifies as a "key" team member and the circumstances under which the
      team member may not be restored to his or her job following leave

Eligible team members seeking to use FMLA leave may be required to provide:
•  30-day advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable
•  notice "as soon as practical" when the need to take FMLA is not foreseeable (at least verbal notice to the
   employer within 1-2 business days of learning of the need to take FMLA leave)
•  sufficient information for the employer to understand that the team member needs leave for FMLA-
   qualifying reasons (the team member need not mention FMLA when requesting leave to meet this
   requirement, but may only explain why the leave is needed)
•  where the employer was not made aware that a team member was absent for FMLA reasons and the team
  member wants the leave counted as FMLA leave, timely notice (generally within two business days of
   returning to work) that leave was taking for FMLA-qualifying reason

In addition to the information required by the FLSA, a covered employer's records must show the following:
•  dates FMLA leave is taken, or hours of leave taken if FMLA leave is in increments of less than a day
•  copies of FMLA notices given to and by team members
•  documents describing team member benefits and leave policies
• premium payments of team member benefits, and record of any dispute over FMLA leave

The records must comply with confidentiality requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The
company may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first
and second opinions differ, the company may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider,
approved jointly by the company and the employee and paid for by the company.

Intermittent or reduced leave. Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule if it is
medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent. If
leave is requested on this basis, however, the company may require the employee to transfer temporarily to a
part-time schedule or an alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits.

Spouses combined leave. Spouses who are both employed by the company are entitled to a total of 12
weeks’ leave (rather than 12 weeks each) for the birth or placement in adoption or foster care of a child for
the care of a sick parent.

Restoration to employment rights. After a leave, an employee will be restored to the position he or she held
when the leave began, or to an equivalent position. However, if upon the expiration of the leave the
employee is unable to perform the essential function of his or her former position because of a physical or
medical condition, the employee has no right to restoration to another position. Except as to employees who
are taking an intermittent leave, as a condition of being restored to their former position, the company may
require the employee to receive certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee be
able to resume work.

VI. Notification and Reporting Requirements: When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth
    of a child, the placement in adoption or foster care of a child, or planned medical treatment, the
   employee must provide reasonable prior notice (thirty days) and make an effort to schedule leave so that
     it does not unduly disrupt Company operations.  Employees who are ill will be required to report
    periodically on their status and their intention to return to work.

VII.   Status of Employee Benefits During Leave of Absence: Health insurance. Group health care
   coverage will continue for employees on leave as if they were still working.

It is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on leave that
would normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or before the first day of the
coverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the Corporate Payroll
Department. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage.  If the leave is paid, premiums will
continue to be paid through payroll deductions.

The Corporate Payroll Department will provide a schedule of payment amounts and due dates at the
beginning of any unpaid leave of absence. (After 12 weeks of leave the team member is then responsible for
100% of the premium.)

Recovery of premiums. If an employee chooses to return to work (meaning: stay for 30 calendar days) after
an approved unpaid leave of absence, the Company may recover from the employee the cost of any payments
made to maintain the employee’s health insurance, unless the failure to return is because of a serious health
condition or reasons beyond the employee’s control.

Benefit entitlement based on length of service will be calculated as of the last paid workday before the start
of the unpaid absence.

If the employee fails to return to work at the conclusion of the leave, the Company may require the employee
to reimburse the full cost of the health care coverage during any period of unpaid leave.

VIII.  Procedures: Employees must contact Corporate Payroll to have FMLA paperwork sent to them.
   Employees must complete the employee portion of the paperwork including signature and date, and have
    their physician complete the Physician portion of the paperwork including signature and date.

                                                                           64 | P a g e

Request form. The employee must fill out a “Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence” Form in
duplicate. This form must be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate
supervisor for proper approvals, and forwarded to the Human Resources Department (see attached copy of
‘Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence’ form).  If possible, the form should be submitted 30
days before the effective date of the leave.

All requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness must include sufficient medical
certification stating:
    (1) the date on which the serious health condition began;
    (2) the probable duration of the condition; and
    (3) the appropriate medical facts that the health care provider knows about the condition.

In addition, for leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the
amount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care.

For leave for an employee illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform at least
one of the functions of his or her position. For certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave
schedule for planned medical treatment, the certificate must state the dates on which such treatment is
expected to be given and the duration of the treatment.

A team member who expects or anticipates taking a family or medical leave is required to notify the
Corporate Payroll Department of the date of commencement and the expected duration of the leave at least
30 days in advance of the leave, or, if the need for the leave is not foreseeable, as soon as practicable. In
cases where the need for leave is foreseeable, a team member's failure to provide 30 days’ notice prior to
taking leave may result in denial or delay of leave. A team member requesting leave under this policy should
submit a complete application for leave form to the Corporate Payroll Department.

Certain "key employees" may not be eligible to be restored to the same or an equivalent position at the
conclusion of their leave. Buchheit will notify such team members of their "key employee" status and the
conditions under which job restoration may be denied, if applicable. "Key employee", as defined by law, is
typically a management position.

An eligible team member may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period
without loss of seniority or benefits. The amount of leave available to a team member at any given time will
be calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the 12-month period immediately
preceding the requested leave. A team member who fails to return to work immediately following expiration
of the authorized leave period will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. All leave taken under this
policy and leave for any other reason which would qualify under FMLA (e.g. worker's compensation leave)
will be counted against the team members leave entitlement under FMLA.

During a family or medical leave provided under this policy, team members shall first exhaust all unused
vacation before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. During a leave related to the team member's
serious health condition, the team member should also exhaust any available vacation or short-term
disability before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. Team members will not receive vacation pay in
addition to compensation from disability or worker's compensation insurance.

                                                                           65 | P a g e

If a team member takes a leave of absence because of the serious health condition of the team member or the
team member's family member, the team member must submit to the Corporate Payroll Department written
medical certification from a health care provider of the serious health condition. Failure to provide such
certification upon request may result in a denial or delay of leave. Buchheit reserves the right to require that
the team member receive a second (and possibly a third) opinion from another health care provider (at
Buchheit's expense) certifying the serious health condition of the team member or the team member's family
member. Buchheit reserves the right to require that a team member provide the company with a
recertification of the medical condition for which leave is taken.

Before being able to return to work, a team member who is on leave of absence as a result of his or her own
serious health condition must submit a health care provider's written certification that the team member is
able to return to work. Failure to provide such certification may result in the delay or denial of job
restoration. During the team member's leave, Buchheit may also periodically inquire as to the team member's
intent to return to work.

Leave taken because of the team member's or family member's serious health condition may be taken on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary. If a team member seeks leave on an
intermittent or reduced schedule basis, the team member must submit medical certification, as discussed
above, and additional certification from the health care provider that the intermittent or reduced schedule
leave is medically necessary.

Buchheit may require a team member taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave to transfer temporarily to
an alternative available position for which the team member is qualified or may modify the team member's
current position to better accommodate the team member's recurring periods of leave.

During the team member's family or medical leave of absence, team members have the option to stop
coverage or stop premium payments during the FMLA leave. If the team member elects to continue
coverage, Buchheit will continue to provide health insurance coverage; however, the team member will
remain personally responsible for paying the team member's portion of the insurance premium. Such
payments may be paid prior to the leave or paid during the leave. Payments must be submitted directly to the
Corporate Payroll Department. The team member must make similar payments for all other benefits in full
during the period leave. A team member who does not return may be required to repay any insurance
premiums paid by Buchheit during the leave. Team members will be eligible for COBRA benefits at the end
of their 12-week FMLA leave of absence or the last day payment was received.

Upon return from family or medical leave in accordance with this policy, the team member will be returned
to the same or equivalent position with no loss in benefits, which accrued prior to the leave of absence. A
team member who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave will be considered to have
voluntarily resigned.

If you anticipate the possibility of taking family or medical leave, or if you have any questions about the
application of this policy to your particular situation, contact the Payroll Office or Chief Financial Officer.

Additional details on The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 may be obtained by contacting the

to the same or equivalent position with no loss in benefits, which accrued prior to the leave of absence. A
team member who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave will be considered to have
voluntarily resigned.

If you anticipate the possibility of taking family or medical leave, or if you have any questions about the
application of this policy to your particular situation, contact the Payroll Office or Chief Financial Officer.

Return to Work Post-Employment Testing
Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 01/01/2010

Post-employment examinations are successful tools utilized to create a more safe and secure working
environment for team members. With the advent of sports technology applied to the industrial worker,
comprehensive stress tests monitor heart and musculoskeletal function to detect disease processes, wear and
tear syndromes, and many other problems that lead to injuries and disability.

Computerized testing and stress evaluations by licensed professionals in a medical setting typically cost over
$1,000, but Buchheit is willing to pay for such services to help their team members remain safe in the
workplace and to reduce costs associated with injuries. Training provided during the examination increases
body awareness during work activities to prevent cumulative trauma and to successfully reduce injuries.
Furthermore, team member turnover and operating expenses are reduced by maintaining properly qualified
personnel in each position.

Post-employment tests may be conducted:
•  as part of team member's participation in a voluntary wellness program
•  to determine a team member's fitness for duty
•  in response to a team member's request for reasonable accommodation

Effective June 1st, 2004, all team members employed by Buchheit will be eligible to participate in voluntary
testing once every 12 months if the team member feels that he/she is physically unable to perform their
essential job functions. Team members are not required to participate in voluntary testing and team members
who elect not to participate will not be penalized for failing to participate.

Fit-for-duty testing may be required on an as-needed basis should a team member demonstrate difficulty
performing any essential function of their position, or if there is some other reasonable basis, for belief that
an individual's ability to perform essential job functions is limited or impaired by a medical condition.
Fit-for-duty testing will be required:
•  any time a team member is transferred, either permanently or temporarily, to a position which has a
   physical demand level which is higher than the position that they are currently working
•  any time a team member is absent from work for 3 or more days due to illness, medical procedure, or
   injury. Exclusion from fit-for-duty testing if the team member misses more than 3 scheduled days due to
   cold or flu symptoms provided you have a doctor’s note.
•  any time a team member has been put on restricted or limited duty due to illness, medical procedure, or
   injury, no matter how many days the team member was absent.
•  any time a team member has been to the emergency room due to illness or injury, no matter how many
   days the team member was absent

Team members must notify their location manager if they have been put on restrictive duty by their
physician. Team members who are put on restricted or limited duty due to a personal illness or injury (not
worker's compensation) may not be allowed to return to work until they have been released to full duty and
have passed the required fit-for-duty testing. Exceptions to this policy are handled on a case-by-case basis
after discussion with the Chief Financial Officer, Loss Prevention Manager, and Location Management.

                                                                           67 | P a g e

Post-employment testing may be required when a team member requests a reasonable accommodation for a
medical condition that is not known or obvious. The cost of all post-employment testing is paid by Buchheit.

Medical information collected in connection with such tests will be maintained in confidential files in
accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the information
collected will not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the ADA.

When necessary to enable an otherwise qualified applicant with a "disability" to participate in testing,
Buchheit will provide reasonable accommodations provided such accommodations do not cause an undue
hardship. Applicants who believe they need an accommodation to participate in the testing program must
request such accommodations. To minimize or avoid delays, Buchheit asks applicants to advise of the need
for any accommodation as soon as possible after receiving a conditional offer of employment.

Buchheit has established a 401(k) savings plan to provide team members with the potential for future

Buchheit team member. You may join the plan at any time. Eligible team members may participate in the
401(k)-plan subject to all terms and conditions of the plan.

The 401(k) savings plan allows you to elect how much salary you want to contribute and direct the
investment of your plan account, so you can tailor your own retirement package to meet your individual
needs. Buchheit also contributes an additional matching amount  to each team member's 401(k)
contribution, equal to one half of the contribution up to 2% of your gross wages, after the 1st year.

Because your contribution to a 401(k) plan is automatically deducted from your pay before federal and state
tax withholdings are calculated, you save tax dollars now by having your current taxable amount reduced.
While the amounts deducted generally will be taxed when they are finally distributed, favorable tax rules
typically apply to 401(k) distributions. Complete details are described in the Summary Plan Description

The Buchheit team member discount program has been designed to benefit you for all of your hard work and
dedication as a vital part of the Buchheit team. We want your business and personal buying to stay here at
Buchheit. This benefit is just another way of making it more convenient for you. If you buy merchandise
elsewhere that we do not handle or can order, let a Store Manager or Buyer know. This will enable us to
recognize your needs and to better accommodate them.

of making it more convenient for you. If you buy merchandise elsewhere that we do not handle or can

The Buchheit Team Member Discount Program includes discounts for yourself, your spouse, all children
under 18 years of age living in the same household or the parents supporting a dependent Team Member
living in the same household. Those not included in the discount program are: friends and family
members living outside the household and friends of the Team Member living in the same household.
This program is for personal family consumption, not for commercial, contracting or resale use.

We feel this is an excellent benefit offered to all Team Members, and we ask that you abide by the
guidelines. If it should be determined that you are abusing the privilege of the Buchheit Team Member
discount card, such as conducting personal "shopping" for unqualified parties with the intent of receiving
your discount, you will lose the benefit and may be subject to corrective action from the company.

Purchases must be made during off-duty hours. The merchandise must be removed from the store at the
time of the purchase. Team Members must sign an invoice for these purchases. Purchases of sodas or
snacks to be consumed while on lunch/break are to be made during the break periods, the receipt should
remain with the item.

then available to you for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Since the amounts that remain in the
account at the end of the plan year are forfeited, you should take care not to over-fund your account.

Details of the Flexible Spending Account program are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD).
Contact the Payroll Department for more information on the FSA program and to obtain enrollment and
reimbursement forms and worksheets with examples of reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses.

Team Member Discounts

Effective Date: 03/23/2009
Revision Date: 09/01/2016

The Buchheit Team Member Discount Program was developed as a way to say, "Thank You" and
show our appreciation to our Team Members for their hard work and dedication.

The Buchheit team member discount program has been designed to benefit you for all of your hard work and
dedication as a vital part of the Buchheit team. We want your business and personal buying to stay here at
Buchheit. This benefit is just another way of making it more convenient for you. If you buy merchandise
elsewhere that we do not handle or can order, let a Store Manager or Buyer know. This will enable us to
recognize your needs and to better accommodate them.

‘We want your business and personal buying to stay here at Buchheit and this benefit is just another way
of making it more convenient for you. If you buy merchandise elsewhere that we do not handle or can
order, let a Manager/Buyer know. This will enable us to recognize and better accommodate your needs.

The Buchheit Team Member Discount Program includes discounts for yourself, your spouse, all children
under 18 years of age living in the same household or the parents supporting a dependent Team Member
living in the same household. Those not included in the discount program are: friends and family
members living outside the household and friends of the Team Member living in the same household.
This program is for personal family consumption, not for commercial, contracting or resale use.

We feel this is an excellent benefit offered to all Team Members, and we ask that you abide by the
guidelines. If it should be determined that you are abusing the privilege of the Buchheit Team Member
discount card, such as conducting personal "shopping" for unqualified parties with the intent of receiving
your discount, you will lose the benefit and may be subject to corrective action from the company.

Purchases must be made during off-duty hours. The merchandise must be removed from the store at the
time of the purchase. Team Members must sign an invoice for these purchases. Purchases of sodas or
snacks to be consumed while on lunch/break are to be made during the break periods, the receipt should
remain with the item.

To qualify for the everyday Buchheit Team Member Discount you must be currently employed by or
have retired status from Buchheit Inc. or any one of its affiliates, including but not limited to Buchheit
Retails Stores, Buchheit Agricultural, Buchheit Logistics, Central States Wholesale Distribution,
Carriage House Cabinets or Central States Repair.

Retired Status is defined as Team members who retire after the age of 62 and have completed 10 (ten)
years of service. These individuals will receive a Good Will Ambassador Discount Card, which will
enable them to continue to receive the Team Member Discount.

A Team Member Discount Card with the cash sales account number will be issued to you to be used
when making a cash purchase. Cards will be issued and become effective after a Team Member has
completed all pre-employment requirements and has submitted all employment information to the
Payroll Office.

The discount amount will be 10%, with the exception of farm chemicals, some power equipment, and sale
and/or clearance items, which are already discounted. Discounts do not apply to in-house accounts. Buchheit
has the right to change the discount amount and departments without notice.

Team members who retire after the age of 62 and have completed ten years of service will receive a Good
Will Ambassador Discount Card, which will enable them to receive the same discount as above.

Team member purchases of soda/snacks to be consumed while on lunch or break are to be made at the
Customer Service Desk. All other purchases must be made during off-duty hours. The merchandise must be
removed from the store at the time of the purchase. Team members must sign an invoice for these purchases.

Special Order items are those that are not normally stocked and have not been assigned a Buchheit SKU
number. Items that have a total delivered cost of $100 or more will receive an additional 15% mark-up on
the cost. Those that have a cost under $100 will receive a 25% mark-up.

Retail Store Discount Program
The Buchheit Retail Store Team Member Discount Program is available to all Team Members of
Buchheit, Inc., on purchases at all Buchheit Retail Store Locations & Central States Repair Shop. This
discount structure is not available at the Buchheit Agri-Center which has a separate Team Member
Discount Program. See below for details of the Buchheit Agri-Center Team Member Discount Program.

The Buchheit Retail Store Team Member Discount program is available on all in store purchases of
stocked merchandise. Over 53,000 items will receive the maximum discount of 10% off the regular
price.

The remaining items will receive a 5% discount off the regular price.

Competitive Price Match
We work hard to make sure our everyday prices are competitive in the market but if by chance after
applying the Team Member Discount a Team Member is able to buy an item cheaper at another retailer
we will match the net price from the other retailer. We want your business to stay here at Buchheit!

Special Orders
Special Order items are those items that have not been assigned a Buchheit SKU number. When a Team
Member purchases a Special-Order item the Team Member Retail on that item will be calculated as a
15% margin percentage over Delivered Landed Cost (Delivered Landed Cost is defined as the cost of the
item + Freight + Adders + any additional cost associated with the order) to the store. To calculate the
Team Member Special Order retail, take the total delivered landed cost divided by .85. (Delivered
Landed Cost / .85 = Team Member Retail). Everyday stocked items cannot be treated as special-order
items.

Items transferred from Buchheit Agri-Center to the stores under a SKU number will be discounted at the
normal Retail Store Team Member Discount Schedule. Items that are transferred from the Buchheit
Agri-Center that do not have a SKU number will be priced as a special order.

Non-Stocked SKUs
Items that are assigned a SKU number but not stocked in the store will be discounted the same as a
stocked item.

Team Member Project Bid Pricing
We want to bid your building projects such as deck projects, kitchen cabinet projects, pole building
projects, house projects, fencing projects, etc. To qualify for Team Member Project Bid Pricing, the
total value of the material list must equal or exceed $1000 (before tax) at the normal Team Member
Price Discount. Projects must be submitted to the corporate estimator to be priced.

Our corporate estimator will review the materials list and, in some cases, will discount items beyond the
normal Team Member Discount program. Because the items involved in these projects are subject to
price fluctuation each project will be treated on a case by case basis. (How to: Team Member Project
Bid Pricing).
