We hope that each employee's period of employment at TNT Construction/Kerkhoff, Inc. can be a
rewarding experience. However, we recognize that circumstances change with the passage of time
and that some employees may seek opportunities elsewhere or choose to leave the company for
other reasons. Other employees may not fulfill the operational needs of the company or changed
circumstances may reduce available employment opportunities, which may result in involuntary
terminations. We sincerely hope that none of these situations occur, but realistically we have to
acknowledge that the possibility does exist. Therefore, the right of the employee or the company to

1.21 EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES

Finding the best employees to work for the Company is of the utmost importance, and on
occasion, a relative of a current employee may be the best-qualified candidate for a position. In the
event that a relative of an employee is hired, the Company may:
    •   Limit the supervisory/subordinate relationships of the relatives;
    •   Limit the situations whereby one checks or verifies the work of the other; and
    •  May limit the situations in which a conflict of interest is likely to exist;

The intent of these guidelines is to protect the Company and rights of other employees, not to put a
potential employee at a disadvantage due to his or her relationship with a current employee. When
appropriate, the Company may determine if alternative methods of organizing work are to be
considered to avoid disqualifying qualified candidates who are related to current employees.

In the event that two existing employees become related while employed, the Company also
reserves the right to alter job assignments to minimize the impact of the reporting relationship. In
extreme cases termination may be necessary.

favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature:

    •  Where giving in to or rejecting the behavior is used as the basis for employment decisions
        affecting the  individual  (e.g.  getting hired  if one submits  to the sexual behavior;
        continuing employment depends on “going along” with harassing conduct, or “giving in”
        to sexual demands such as dates, ‘late night meetings’, or a sexual relationship, to name a
       few)

        (heterosexual or gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender) including harassment motivated by
       a belief that a co-worker does not conform to the stereotypes of his or her gender.

offended employee should inform her/his supervisor/manager, human resources, or any member of
management including the General Manager.

detail as possible, including: the nature of the incident(s); dates, times, and places it has occurred;
name of the offender; witnesses; their response to the incident(s); the effect/impact of the behavior
on them. A form is provided for this purpose. The offended person who contacts management with
a complaint  is encouraged to submit this documentation; however, complaints may be filed
verbally.  Alternate methods of filing complaints shall be made available to individuals with
disabilities who need accommodation.

SECTION 7
       WORK RULES OF GENERAL CONDUCT

7.1 ORDER OF CORRECTIVE ACTION

These rules are guidelines only and are not all inclusive.

The Company holds each of its employees to abide by certain work rules of general conduct and
performance at all times. The regulations governing employee conduct and responsibilities have
been established in the best interest of the company, its employees, and its customers.

The usual sequence of corrective actions includes a verbal warning, a written warning, disciplinary
suspension and or probation from work without pay and benefits, and finally termination of
employment.  In deciding which initial corrective action would be appropriate, management will
consider the seriousness of  the  action, the circumstances surrounding the matter, and the
employee’s previous record.

       Step No. 1: Verbal Warning
Inform the employee that he/she must correct his/her actions or further disciplinary action will be
taken; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the employee sign
the form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days.

       Step No. 2: Written Warning
When the performance or the policy violation does not improve or change, management will
explain to the employee that through observations, it appears that he/she is knowingly not meeting
the job requirement; explain that if the employee does not correct his/her actions he/she will be
subject to discipline; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the
employee sign the form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days.

       Step No.3: Disciplinary Suspension and Probation
If the employee's performance continues to be below standard or the policy violation is continually
violated, the management will: discuss the situation; inform the employee of his/her continued
deficiency; inform the employee of a suspension without compensation, benefits will not
accrue nor will benefits be recoverable during the suspension period; record the result of
discussion; have employee sign the appropriate form and suspend the employee. The employee
will also be notified that they will be on probation when s/he returns to work. Length of probation
will be determined on a case by case situation. This form will remain in the employees personnel
file.

       Step No. 4: Termination
This is the final step involved in the process and the Company is hopeful  it does not have to
employ  this  step. In the event of Theft, Sexual Harassment and/or other types of actions
PROHIBITED by policy, this step may, in fact, be the "first" step because of the serious offenses
involved. In this step management will: discuss the situation, record the termination action on the
appropriate form; inform the employee of the decision; show the employee the discipline form;
collect all Company materials and equipment; escort the employee from Company premises.
This form will remain in the employees personnel file.

Management reserves the right to terminate or discipline any employee as the Company, in its sole
discretion, considers necessary in individual circumstances

by all employees at all times.

The most important part of safety is YOU. It is your responsibility to abide by the safety rules -
these rules are made for your protection and to help you do your job correctly and safely.

seems apparent, please ask or notify management immediately. Always remember  that the

        of any member of management at any time
       Employees' decisions should always be guided by the company's commitment to safety
       Should a hazardous situation or condition exist and a decision has to be made on safety or
        production, safety concerns should always take precedence over production.

It is management's responsibility to see that every employee at the Company is provided with safe
working conditions, all safety regulations are observed and employees use good common sense to
protect themselves as well as others. Management will periodically inspect working conditions
and may suspend all work activity until an unsafe condition is corrected.

RULES, THAT EMPLOYEE WILL  RECEIVE AN "EMPLOYMENT  VIOLATION".
REPEATED VIOLATIONS MAY BE CAUSE FOR TERMINATION.

> Employees’ decisions should always be guided by the company's commitment to safety

> Should a hazardous situation or condition exist and a decision has to be made on safety or
production, safety concerns should always take precedence over production.

It is management's responsibility to see that every employee at the Company is provided with safe
working conditions, all safety regulations are observed and employees use good common sense to
protect themselves as well as others. Management will periodically inspect working conditions
and may suspend all work activity until an unsafe condition is corrected.

As you know, safety often involves using common sense. Therefore, when a hazardous condition
seems apparent, please ask or notify your supervisor immediately. Always remember that the
common sense — safe way is the best way to do every job. Discuss your concerns with your
immediate supervisor when in doubt.

Most successful projects take more than one person. Safety and production is a team effort.
Therefore, focus on production with safety.

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE SAFETY

RULES, THAT EMPLOYEE WILL RECEIVE AN "EMPLOYMENT VIOLATION".
REPEATED VIOLATIONS MAY BE CAUSE FOR TERMINATION.

10.1 A WORKPLACE ACCIDENT & INJURY REDUCTION (AWAIR)

The Company promotes a safe and healthful working condition for all employees. To do so,
management and employees will strive to reduce to extent and severity of work related injuries
and illnesses. The Company specifically proposes the following steps to meet that objective.
        All persons employed by the Company will become keenly AWAIR that reducing injuries
          is everyone’s business. Continued discussions, toolbox meetings, job site inspections by
       management, and an annual safety meeting are avenues we will use to become even more
     AWAIR of avoiding jobsite hazards.
        All employees of the Company will attend training sessions to enhance job skills. Any
        accident involving injury will be reported immediately so we can learn how to avoid that
        injury in the future. At the annual safety meeting, all employees will be asked their input
        in discussions where together we can identify, analyze, and control new and existing
        hazards, conditions, and operations. The issues raised at this meeting become priority
        items in our risk management.
      Our plan of action will be by verbal discussion at the safety meeting and followed up on
        issues that were raised and the appropriate way to minimize the risk of injury for each
         situation.
      Management will investigate the accident involving injury to see what caused the injury
       and what will be done to reduce future risk of that injury. This will be communicated to all
       employees.

10.2 GENERAL EMPLOYEE SAFETY RULES:

       Employees will be required to know the Company’s Safety & Health policy.
       Employees of the Company are required to attend tool box meetings and annual "Right to
      Know" training and "Injury & Illness Prevention (AWAIR) Program".
       Informal tool box meetings will be held to air any safety or hazard issues that may be
        discovered while working.
     Know the location of all safety equipment and how to use them. Put safety equipment
       back where they belong so the next person can find them.
       Employees must be familiar with safe operating procedures for each piece of equipment
        before operating it. Do not attempt to operate special machinery or equipment without
       permission and instructions.
       Employees must be familiar with OSHA'S safety regulations for jobs performed before
         starting.
       Employees are encouraged to suggest in person or anonymously, to Management of any
       equipment or procedure that is discovered to be a hazard, unsanitary, or dangerous to your
        health. Do not operate any equipment which in your opinion is unsafe or is in need of
         repair.
       Employees are required to report any injuries, accidents, or "near misses" to the office
       immediately so proper first aid or medical treatment can be given.
       Maintain and inspect all tools and equipment prior to their use.
      Use tools only for their intended purposes. Do not use broken or dangerously dull tools.
        All switches or drives on machinery shall be shut off and locked-out before cleaning,
        greasing, oiling, or making adjustments or repairs.
       Maintain and operate all equipment and vehicles in a clean and safe condition.
       Maintain good housekeeping in all your work areas. This is a reflection of the quality of
       your work. Disorder wastes time and energy and often results in injury.
      Use of seatbelts is mandatory while operating all company vehicles and equipment.
     BUCKLE UP!!!!!!
       Only authorized personnel should access equipment. No unauthorized passengers.

10.4 HAZARDOUS WASTES

The Environmental Protection Agency has grouped certain chemicals and chemical groups into
categories which have been defined as toxic.  This means that in concentrated forms or by
accumulating and combining with other chemicals (even the  air), these chemicals can be
hazardous to human health if exposure occurs.

From time to time in the normal course of their jobs, employees may handle materials which have
been classified as hazardous by the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
regulations.

Hazardous materials that are received from our suppliers should have Safety Date Sheets (SDS) or
labels which state the chemical ingredients of the contents, precautions to take, and what to do if
exposure occurs.

Moving loads through doorways and aisles can cause hand injuries.
       Guards must always be in place. Always disconnect the power and lockout machines
        before repairing.
     Do not wear gloves around moving machinery.
      Always use the correct tool for the job. For example, do not use a screwdriver as a chisel.
      Make sure the tools are in good working order and follow instructions. Store tools
        properly - one in the wrong place could cause an accident.
      Always cut away from your body.
     Do not put hands for feeding materials into machinery.
     Do not put hands near moving machinery parts.
      Read instructions on chemical container labels and SDS before working with chemicals.
      Make sure you wear the correct gloves for the chemical being used.
       Report any injuries to the office.

10.12 HARD HAT POLICY

Hard hats must be worn at all times on all hard hat designated jobs. Hard hats must be worn at
all times on all jobs with exposure to overhead loads such as excavators, backhoes, loaders,
cranes, etc.

The only exceptions to this policy are people involved protected by cab enclosures.

10.13 EYE PROTECTION POLICY

Any person operating hand tools such as chop saws, chipping hammers, jack hammers, breaking
malls, hydraulic breaker, etc. or any other tool that could produce an eye injury hazard without
using proper safety equipment will be given one warning.

10.14 MACHINE GUARDING

It is the responsibility of all supervisors to train employees of safe work practices while working
with guards. Severe injury may result when there is improper safeguarding. Safeguarding is a
method of eliminating a hazard.
     No safeguard, barrier, or enclosure shall be adjusted or removed for any reason by anyone
        unless that person has specific permission from the supervisor, the employee has been
        specifically trained to do the work, and machine adjustment is considered a normal part of
         their job.
       Before safeguarding or other guarding devices are removed for repair, or adjustments or
        servicing are done, the power to the equipment must be turned off and the main switch
       locked out and tagged.
     No equipment or machine will be started unless the safeguards are in place and in good
        condition.
        Defective or missing safeguards must be immediately reported to the supervisor.
     No employee shall reach around a safeguard, barrier, or enclosure. The primary benefit of
        safeguarding is that  it helps improve production. By safeguarding, employees are not
        afraid of the machine and they pay more attention to their production responsibilities.

10.15 LOCKOUT PROCEDURES

Purpose: To prevent injury from the unexpected energization, start-up or stored energy that
could cause injury.

Safety Rules for Lockout
       Never remove guards or reach around guards while any machine is operating.
        Prior to starting work on a piece of equipment, shut off the main power switch and place a
        lockout device on the switch.
      Make sure all movement has stopped before entering or servicing any machine.
          If more than one person is working at the same time, EVERY individual on that machine
       must have a lock on the lockout device. No lockout will be permitted to be cut off without
        authority from your supervisor.
      Any time you are working on presses, changing dies, or removing rules, the operator must
        lockout the machine and safety block must be in place.
       Lockouts must be placed when changing blade or adjusting blade.
      Make sure machine is clear, prior to restarting the machine.
    NO Machine down-time is worth LIFE, LIMB, or JOB!!!!

Lockout Procedures
It  is the responsibility of  all supervisors to train employees on lockout procedures. This  is
essentially due to the grave threat to life and limb. Lockout procedures must be documented on the
supervisor's safety training checklist. Enforcement of lockout  shall be the responsibility of
supervisors and management.
          If equipment needs repair, alterations, inspections, clearing of jams, or cleaning, the
       equipment must be shut down and locked out.
      The machine operator and others must be notified that the equipment cannot be set into
       motion without supervisor's permission.
        All sources of power are to be identified, turned off, and locked out. All stored energy
        sources must be removed. All personnel must be clear of the equipment. The equipment
       must be turned on to be sure the equipment power source is locked out, and then turned off
        again. Your padlocks must be placed on the control switch, lever or valve, even though
      someone has locked the controls before you. You will not be protected unless you put your
      own padlock on it.
      Once lockout is completed, you must hang a "danger tag" on the controls showing the date
       and the employee's signature. Pad-lock and tags must be in place before any work can be
       performed.
     When work is done, you must replace all guards and remove your own padlock and tag.
       Never permit someone else to remove it for you. Be sure you are not exposing another
       person to danger by removing your padlock or sign.
     When power has to be continued in order to perform a job, the area supervisor must be
         notified. A maintenance employee or supervisor will stand by while work  is being
       performed. When the job is completed, padlocks will be reinstalled.
          If work is not completed by the end of the shift or day, the person locking out the
       equipment must notify their supervisor. The supervisor will make sure locks and tags are
       changed to those that will continue the work.

10.16 BACK INJURY PREVENTION

It  is the  responsibility of  all supervisors  to  train employees on proper  lifting techniques.
Supervisors must correct employees when using incorrect lifting techniques.
Approximately fifty percent of all personal injuries are caused by overexertion and most of these
injuries are back injuries. Everyone should follow these proper lifting techniques.

The two-hand squat and stoop method as follows:
       Get close to the load and grasp it firmly, hugging it.
        Set your stomach muscles as if you were doing a pelvic tilt. This helps prepare them to
        support the load.
      Keep your back upright with a slight backward arch as you use your leg muscles to lift the
        load.
        Set the load down smoothly.

The assisted one-hand lift method is as follows:
As you bend over into a container, rest your free hand on the edge of the container for support, and
use the other hand and to lift the object or part. As you come out of the lift, push down with your
free hand on the container edge to push your back and object up. When there is no container to rest
your free hand on, use the area right above your knee as an anchor point.

The assisted one-hand lift method is a way of lifting that is shared by the shoulder muscles, which
are more developed than lower back muscles. This method does have limitations. This is the best
method when the weight to be lifted does not exceed 15-25 pounds.

In addition, these are back injury prevention safety tips:
1. Lift comfortably.
2. Avoid unnecessary bending, twisting, and reaching.
3. Lift gradually and slowly.
4. Keep in good physical shape.

If at all possible use a skidloader or get help!!! Don’t think you’re Superman.

10.17 WASTE CONTAINMENT

All waste fluids (oil and other fluids) drained from any equipment will be collected, stored in
proper containers, labeled and disposed of in an approved manner. Waste oil must be recovered at
all times.
       Waste oil from the jobsite may be brought to the shop facility and stored for future
       consumption or disposal.
        All disposal filters to be placed in 50 gallon barrel for proper disposal.

10.18 GARBAGE

All garbage is to be cleaned out of vehicles & equipment daily (no exceptions).
        Place garbage in brown receptacle east side of shop.
        Recyclable material  (plastic,  glass,  steel & aluminum, paper & cardboard) in blue
         receptacle east side of shop.
If you are in doubt about what’s recyclable the list is on the bulletin board.
