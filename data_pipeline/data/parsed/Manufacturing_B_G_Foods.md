Louisiana.

We are very proud to be a part of Yum! Brands Inc., the parent company of Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried

This employee handbook has been prepared as a general guide to inform you about the human resources
policies and procedures of B & G Food Enterprises, LLC. It outlines many of the company’s employment
practices, as well as the benefits available to you. This handbook and the policies in it replace any prior
editions of this handbook, policies, and memos that are hereby retracted, withdrawn, and canceled.

Throughout this handbook, any reference to “company” refers to B & G Food Enterprises, LLC and all its
locations.

**New employees are expected to read this handbook along with their new hire packet. The most**
**current version of this handbook will be posted on the Company’s Internet. If you have a question**
**about any of the company’s policies or procedures, you should ask your General Manager to help**
**clear up any questions you may have. The** ***Statement of Acknowledgement and Agreement*** **form at the**
**end of this handbook must be signed with your digital signature signifying that you have read and**
**agree to abide by company policies. Your digital signature is required in order to upload your**
**information into the company’s payroll system.**

**AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT STATUS**

Employment with the company is on an at-will basis. This means that you and the company are each free
to terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.

The company has no employment contract, assurances, or guarantee of continued employment by the
employee. Likewise, employees have no employment contract, assurances, or guarantee of continued
employment with the company. No verbal communication or written document will provide such a
contract, assurance, or guarantee unless specified in writing and signed by a company official who is
authorized to enter into such an agreement.

**MODIFICATION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

Your compensation, hours of employment, work location, and all other terms and conditions of employment
are subject to modification by the company at management’s discretion. In addition, management may
determine that a transfer or other reassignment of any employee is necessary in order to fulfill business
needs and requirements.

**HANDBOOK IS NOT A CONTRACT**

The policies and procedures presented within this handbook are for information and illustrative purposes
and are in no way meant to be a contract of employment or guarantee of continued employment for any
specific period of time. The work rules contained in the policies and procedures are for illustrative purposes
and are not considered to be all inclusive.

Company management reserves the right to unilaterally amend or withdraw any policy, procedure, or
benefit at any time with or without notice, for any reason it deems appropriate. Amendments or
modifications are effective upon announcement.

In the event that any contradiction arises between the policies and information contained in this handbook

---

and specific federal, state, or local laws or requirements, the latter will govern in all cases. Nothing in this
handbook or any company policy is intended to interfere with employees’ rights to discuss their terms and
conditions of employment including, but not limited to compensation, benefits, work hours and working
conditions, etc.

**MISREPRESENTATIONS**

Any misrepresentation made or falsification of information provided by an individual when completing the
employment application or at any time during the employment process and/or during his/her employment
will be considered grounds for dismissal without advance notice.

**ENFORCEMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF POLICIES**

Violation of any policies and procedures, or reasonable suspicion of any such violations, may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Additionally, acts that violate policies
may also violate civil or criminal laws and may result in possible prosecution and/or assessment of civil
and/or criminal penalties. If company management decides to make an exception to a policy or practice in
a certain instance, this does not restrict management’s right to adhere to the policy or practice in the future.

No provision of any policy contained within this document will be interpreted to interfere with or chill
employees’ rights to engage in concerted activity for their mutual aid and protection.

**REPORTING OF POLICY VIOLATIONS**

You are required to immediately report any observed or known violations of any policy or law, including
incidents of discrimination or harassment. Reports should immediately be made to the Manager, VP, Senior
Staff, Human Resources Department, or Human Resources at (985) 384-3333.

Complaints of policy violations will be promptly and carefully investigated, including interviews with all
relevant persons. Investigators will conduct an objective investigation that strikes a balance between the
need to conduct a thorough investigation and an employee’s desire for privacy; no employee is guaranteed
complete confidentiality and/or anonymity during an investigation.

Employees who utilize this procedure in good faith are assured that they will be free from any and all
reprisal or retaliation from reporting such violations or cooperating in an investigation. The company will
not tolerate complaints that are abusive or made in bad faith.

You are expected to fully cooperate in any investigation involving issues relating to the company’s policies,
procedures, property, or any other aspect of the company’s business affairs.

It is the policy of B & G Food Enterprises, LLC. to support and promote the concepts of equal employment
opportunity and nondiscrimination in all areas of employment, without regard to race, color, religion,
national origin, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), age, disability, genetic
information, or veteran status. The Company will comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws
regarding the employment of individuals. Employment decisions are based solely on employees’
qualifications, merit, and performance, subject to the business requirements of the company. Requests for
accommodations will be reviewed for qualified individuals. Reasonable accommodations will be made in
accordance with applicable law.

This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to the following:
recruitment, hiring, placement, transfer, promotion and demotion, training, development and educational
assistance programs, compensation and benefits, social and recreational programs, discipline, and
termination of employment.

The company also maintains a policy prohibiting discrimination and retaliation for those who are a past or
present member of the uniformed service, have applied for membership in the uniformed service; or are
obligated to serve in the uniformed service. This policy applies to initial employment, reemployment,
retention in employment, promotion, and any benefit of employment.

Your cooperation and support are expected in order to maintain a working environment free from
discrimination. If you feel as though you have been subjected to any type of prohibited discrimination,

complaint must include the specific nature of the incident and the date(s) and place(s) such alleged
discrimination or retaliation took place, as well as the name of the individual(s) known to be involved. If
the company receives a report of prohibited discrimination, it is the company’s practice to investigate.

conduct or any instance of discrimination or harassment, you are encouraged to report this business abuse
to B&G Employee Hotline (985) 518-7903. Callers may remain anonymous. A cash reward of up to $may be presented to an individual who provides B&G with detailed information of theft or other
improprieties.

**EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES**

**In Louisiana** Employees under the age of eighteen are required to have an employment certificate or work
permit before they may work. The minor to be employed must obtain the required employment certificate
(Minor Work Permit) from the school board, and the Store Manager is to have a copy of the employment
certificate in the files of the Morgan City office with the electronic hiring packet. The employment
certificate is to be maintained until the minor reaches the age of eighteen or until the minor is no longer
employed by B & G Food.

**YOUR PERSONNEL FILE**

The information contained in the personnel files is the property of the Company. Personnel files are kept
at the Restaurant Support Center and may not be removed from the premises. If you want to review your
file, you may do so in the presence of Area Coach / Human Resources Manager during regular business
hours.

It is your responsibility to inform the Company of any changes to your personal status that may alter payroll
or benefits status. Such information may include, but is not limited to:

--- Last Name - Gain or Loss of Dependents
--- Marital Status - W-4 Deductions
--- Beneficiaries - Telephone Number
--- Address - Emergency Contact
--- Direct Deposit Updates

Former employees and other individuals who are not employed by the company will not be permitted access
to the personnel files, except in particular instances such as during a review by a government agency.
Additionally, requests by former employees for copies of documents in the personnel files generally will
not be honored.

**HEALTH CERTIFICATION**

Company policy calls for strict adherence to all state and local health codes. In locations where a health
permit or health certification is required, you must provide such documents to your manager on your first
day of employment. These documents will be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager. Failure to
comply with this requirement will necessitate suspension from employment until the documents are
received, with no guarantee of recall.

---

**CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS**

The company reserves the right to conduct credit investigations on applicants for and employees in certain
cash handling positions and other fiduciary positions as deemed appropriate.

The company also retains the express right to conduct background investigations on prospective and current
employees. Background investigations may include review of criminal conviction records. Conviction of
a crime is not an absolute bar to employment and will not automatically eliminate an individual from
consideration for or continuation of employment. All relevant circumstances, such as how long ago the
conviction occurred and the crime involved, will be considered in relation to specific job requirements.
Conviction of a crime that is related to the job the individual is expected to perform may be cause for denial
of employment. Arrest records alone will generally not be considered in determining an individual’s
eligibility for employment, although the underlying behavior may be considered.

The company will comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all applicable
amendments when conducting any type of background investigation (e.g., criminal, credit, motor vehicle
record, etc.). Particularly, the Human Resources Representative will ensure the correct disclosure of rights
has been made, authorization has been received before a background investigation is conducted, appropriate
adverse action notices have been provided in instances in which an adverse action is taken due to the results
of a background investigation, and the safeguarding of personally identifiable financial information has
been maintained. Also, the company will comply with laws governing the proper disposal of any
documents (paper, electronic, or other format) that contain consumer information derived from a credit
report. Reasonable measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive
consumer-related information.

The company reserves the right not to employ or retain in employment anyone who has been convicted of
any felony or misdemeanor offense that relates to the duties and responsibilities of the position.

You must report any conviction occurring during the course of your employment to the Human Resources
Representative immediately.

**HIRING YOUR RELATIVES**

Approval for hiring relatives must be received from the President of the Company. Relatives may be
allowed to work in the same restaurant; however, relatives may not work in direct reporting relationships
or supervise each other in any way. Relatives may not work on the same shift. For the purpose of this
policy “relatives” include an employee’s spouse, children, parents, brothers/sisters, grandparents,
grandchildren, aunts/uncles, cousins, and corresponding step and/or in-law relations.

**DIVERSITY**

Our company is committed to acknowledging and valuing employee differences and to creating an
environment in which every individual's unique strengths and abilities are developed and valued. All
employees share in the responsibility for creating this environment and are expected to demonstrate mutual
respect and acceptance in the workplace. We believe that utilizing our employees' uniqueness enhances
communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills, thereby improving our company’s
productivity and performance. We also believe that if our employees mirror the diverse make-up of our
communities and our customers, we will be able to better understand, and more effectively respond to,
market changes. We strive for excellence in our ability to create an inclusive, respectful, and equitable
environment for our employees through leadership, policies, and practices.

---

**RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**

The company will consider all requests for religious accommodations. Such requests may include time off
for attendance at religious services, an absence for observance of a religious holiday, or an employee’s
attire.

Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s religious beliefs, unless such an
accommodation results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition.

**DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION**

The company will consider all requests for disability accommodations to individuals who are otherwise
qualified to perform the essential functions of a job. When an employee has a need for an accommodation,
the employee must let the Human Resources Manager know that an adjustment or a change at work is
needed for a reason related to a medical condition. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first
step in an informal, interactive process between the employee and the company. The company will make
an attempt to accommodate the employee’s need for workplace changes with the company’s need to
maintain an efficient, productive workplace.

Before addressing the merits of the accommodation request, the company will determine if the employee’s
medical condition meets the definition of a disability, a prerequisite for the employee to be entitled to a
reasonable accommodation. The term disability means, with respect to an individual:

- A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of theindividual

- A record of such an impairment; or
- Being regarded as having such an impairment
Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,
concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of a
major bodily function, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth,
digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive
functions.

The company may require documentation showing that the employee has a covered disability and stating
any functional limitations. The documentation must be sufficient to substantiate that the employee has a
covered disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested.

Reasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s disability, unless such an accommodation
results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. An undue hardship
will be based upon an individualized assessment of current circumstances.

#### TRAINING

**THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS**

At each of our restaurants, you will hear repeatedly: Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance,
Product Quality and Speed with Service. These are the principles that our brands were built on and are the
standards for our daily operation. If we can provide our guests with great service, we can keep their loyalty
and they will come back.

We want to provide our guests with an atmosphere that is fun, casual, and comfortable. Each of our
restaurants has been designed with the guest in mind, in order to make our guests’ stay a truly enjoyable
one. Great service begins and ends with you----we want to have Customer Maniacs working for B&G.

**Cleanliness:** To ensure that our guests have a dining experience that is both pleasant and healthy, we
constantly clean and maintain the entire restaurant – the exterior, the dining area, the counter area, the
restrooms, and the kitchen. We really never have a “spare” moment, because whenever business slows
down, we are cleaning.

**Hospitality:** We treat our customers as if they were guests in our own home. We will go that extra step to
make guests feel welcome. We strive to provide good service because it makes our job more pleasant and
also improves our business. Taco Bell along with the other YUM Brands spend millions of dollars each
year on advertising, but the attentiveness, courtesy, and friendliness you display toward our guests is our
most important form of marketing.

**Product Quality and Accuracy:** Our menu items are the product of a great deal of research and
development, but we rely on you to make sure that every one of our guests enjoys a hot, tasty, and perfectly
prepared meal every time they visit one of our restaurants. We are famous for the quality of our food, so
we will insist that you follow specific food preparation procedures that are both efficient and sanitary.

**Speed with Service:** One thing always to keep in mind is that efficient guest service is our number one
priority. Everything we do is for our guest because our guests are our business. Guests come to Taco Bell
expecting fast and friendly service, so we expect you to be efficient, attentive, courteous, and respectful at
all times.

---

#### TEAMWORK

Teamwork plays a big role within each individual restaurant operation. Also, the spirit of teamwork makes
the job a great deal more enjoyable, which in turn is passed along to our guests.

Think of teamwork as you would playing a game. One great star does not necessarily do everything it takes
to help the team win. It is only when all of the players pull together and enjoys the team’s performance
again and again. We accomplish a great team performance through proper training.

**THE TRAINING PROGRAM**

The Company training program is implemented in the stores to ensure that employees build the skills
needed to serve our customers.

- Doing more for and giving more to customers than the competition.

- Learning the processes and procedures required to meet/exceed expectations and standards.

- Improving performance to ensure the Restaurant’s continuous growth and success.

- Developing employees’ self-sufficiency in running the Restaurant.

**Training Systems:** Web-based training systems are designed for trainees who are new to their jobs. The
training systems help trainees develop the skills and knowledge they need to meet and maintain our high
restaurant operating standards. Trainees must be certified in each position that they train for. Your manager
will explain all aspects of the Company’s training programs.

Individuals are constantly encouraged to improve their performance, expand the scope of their
responsibilities, and provide training to other employees who need it. That is the only way that restaurant
employees can become self-sufficient and successful.

Your managers will explain all aspects of the Company’s training program.

---

#### COMPENSATION

**OUR PAY PROCEDURES**

The payroll period is two work weeks (14 days) long. It begins on Wednesday at 12:00 a.m. and ends two
weeks later on Tuesday 11:59 p.m. Payday is on Friday of the week following the end of the payroll period
(every other Friday). Pay will be distributed either through direct deposit or pay card. Consult your
manager for more information. If payday falls on a Company-designated holiday, you will be paid on the
preceding regularly scheduled workday. You should submit any discrepancies in your paycheck, changes
to your pay status or other information affecting your pay to Human Resources.

Pay cards cannot be cashed at the restaurant, nor will it be possible to receive an advance against unpaid
earnings.

**PENALTIES FOR WRONG INFO FROM TEAM MEMBER**

If a deposit is not able to be made into an account because of a Team Member’s error (i.e. gave the wrong
information, closed the account, or used an expired account), any fee assessed to B & G will be charged to
the Team Member. If the manager is responsible for the error, the manager will be responsible for any fee
assessed.

**RECORDING YOUR TIME**

You are responsible for properly recording your time worked. You must clock in and clock out at the
beginning and end of your shift. If you leave work at any time for personal reasons, you must clock out.
You must never clock in or out for another employee or have anyone clock in or out for you.

- **Absolutely no work is to be performed off the clock; notify the Restaurant Support Center if**
**you are asked to do so.**

- **Absolutely no work is to be performed that is not properly accounted for on the Time and**
**Attendance System.**

- Always keep track of the amount of hours worked to confirm that your paycheck is correct. Any
errors should be brought to the immediate attention of your General Manager. If the problem is
not solved to your satisfaction, contact your Area Coach.

- **Never use** the **“BK”** key when clocking in or out. **Using this key can and will lead to your**
**dismissal** .

- Minors in Louisiana must pay strict attention to their recorded time in and out for **35-minute breaks**
**to avoid termination.**

**WHEN OVERTIME BECOMES NECESSARY**

Whenever possible, we will avoid asking you to work overtime; but you may occasionally be requested to
work extra hours. When this occurs, we expect you to cooperate and help out wherever and whenever you
are needed. Overtime occurs when hours worked exceed 40 hours in a workweek (Wednesday – Tuesday).

---

Overtime is authorized and scheduled only by the General Manager and is never scheduled at crew member
discretion. You must receive advance approval from the General Manager prior to working overtime.

Vacation, sick leave, and other paid absences are not considered time worked for the purpose of calculating
overtime pay. You must actually work over 40 hours in a workweek in which a paid absence day occurs
to receive overtime pay.

**EARNING A PAY INCREASE**

**FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE**

**Eligibility** – If you work at a company location with 50 employees within 75 miles and have at least months of service and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the preceding 12 months, you may be eligible
for up to 12 weeks of medical leave of absence for certain family care and medical reasons, during any
rolling 12-month period. Generally, employment periods prior to a break in service of seven years or more
will not be counted in determining whether the employee has completed at least 12 months of service. The
12-month period will be measured backward from the date you use leave and include both paid and unpaid
leaves. Each time you use leave, the remaining leave available will be the balance of the 12 weeks that has
not been used during the immediately preceding 12-month period.

**Description of Qualified Leaves** – You may be entitled for up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave
for the following reasons:

`o` the birth of a son or daughter and to care for the newborn
`o` placement of a son or daughter for adoption or a foster child with you.

(Leave for such purposes must be taken in one consecutive period and must be completed within
12 months following the birth or placement. However, this leave does not have to be taken
immediately following the birth or placement of the child.)
`o` To care for your spouse, son, daughter, or parent (not in-laws) with a serious health condition.

Employees who are not eligible for family and medical leave will not be allowed an unpaid personal
leave of absence for the illness of a parent.
`o` For your own serious health condition that prevents you from performing your job duties and

responsibilities.
`o` For a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that your spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered

military member defined as:

- National Guard or Reserves or retired member of the Regular Armed Forces or Reserves onfederal active duty in a foreign country or is called to federal active duty in a foreign country,
provided that such duty is in support of a contingent operation; or

- Regular Armed Forces deployed to a foreign country or international waters regardless of thenature of the service performed in that foreign country or international waters and regardless
of whether it is in support of a contingent operation.

Absences due to a work-related injury or illness, whether paid or unpaid, which qualify as a serious health
condition will be considered absences under this policy, and time off will be deducted from the maximum
annual 12-week leave entitlement period.

You may be entitled for up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period if you are the spouse, son,
daughter, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember and must care for that
servicemember. A covered servicemember who has a serious illness or injury incurred in the line of duty
on active duty for which he or she is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in outpatient
status, or is on the temporary disability retired list. Coverage also includes a servicemember’s serious
illness or injury that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty which was aggravated
by service in the line of duty on active duty. A covered servicemember includes a member of the Armed
Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves or a member of the Armed Forces, the National Guard or
Reserves who is on the temporary disability retired list. Covered servicemember also includes a veteran
discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable , who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness and who was a member of the Armed Forces within
the five years prior to the time the employee’s military caregiver leave begins.

---

An eligible employee will be entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks of all type of FMLA leave. The
“single 12-month period” referenced above begins on the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave
to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12 months after that date, regardless of the method used to
determine the 12 workweeks for other FMLA qualifying reasons.

**If Both Spouses Work for the Company** - If both spouses are employed by the company, a combined
total of 12 weeks is available for the birth of a son or daughter or to care for the child after birth, placement
of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, or to care for the employee’s parent with a serious
health condition. Spouses employed by the company are limited to a combined total of 26 weeks for leave
during the relevant 12-month period if the leave taken is to care of a covered servicemember and for the
birth or placement of a health child or care for parent with a serious health condition. The military caregiver
leave does not alter the 12-week limitation that applies to leave taken by spouses employed by the same
employer for leave for the birth or placement of a healthy child or to care for a parent with a serious health
condition, even if the spouses combined took fewer than 14 weeks of leave to care for a covered
servicemember.

**Compensation** – All available sick leave must be taken at the commencement of the leave period, prior to
beginning unpaid leave status, if the leave is due to a serious health condition. All available vacation must
be taken at the commencement of a leave of absence, after the use of available sick leave and prior to
beginning unpaid leave status. The maximum amount of leave time available will be 12 weeks, (or weeks for Military Caregiver Leave) including both paid and unpaid leave. An employee who incurs a
work-related illness or injury cannot substitute paid vacation or sick leave for workers’ compensation
payments.

**Requesting Leave** – In the event of foreseeable leaves, you must provide 30 days’ notice, or as much notice
as is practicable, by completing a “Request for Medical Leave of Absence Form” at the Restaurant Support
Center. If 30 days’ notice is not possible, you must provide notification no later than the next business day
after learning of the need for the leave.

**Medical Certification** – When leave is taken due to a serious health condition of either you or a covered
family member, you must provide the certification form completed by a health care provider within 15 days
of the request. If the certification is incomplete or insufficient, the Human Resources Representative will
notify you and allow you up to 7 days to cure the certification deficiency. The Human Resources
Representative may seek clarification from your health care provider regarding the information contained
on the certification form with your written authorization provided to the company and to your health care
provider. The Company reserves the right to request a second and/or third opinion, at the Company’s
expense, from a health care provider chosen by the Company. Additionally, a recertification verifying the
need for leave may be requested by the Company to support a continuing medical leave every 30 days or
at the expiration of the minimum duration of the condition, whichever is later. Such recertification can be
requested at any reasonable interval but not less than every 30 days unless:

◼
You request an extension of leave;

◼
Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly; or

◼
Company management receives information that casts doubt on the continuing validity of the most
recent certification.

In the event that appropriate certification or recertification is not provided, the leave of absence will not be
granted or continued, and you will be subject to the company’s policies regarding unexcused absences.

Fitness-for-duty certification will be required in order to verify that you are able to return to work.
Certification of fitness to return to duty for absences taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave

---

may be required once every 30 days if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee’s ability to
perform his or her duties. No second or third opinions will apply for fitness-for-duty certifications.

**Qualifying Exigency Certification –** When leave is taken due to a qualifying exigency (e.g., short-notice
deployment, military events, financial and legal arrangements, military member’s parental care, etc.) related
to active duty or a call to active duty for the employee’s spouse, son daughter or parent, the employee
should provide a copy of the covered military member’s active-duty orders or other documentation issued
by the appropriate military branch. The Human Resources Representative may contact the appropriate
military unit to request verification that a covered military member is on active duty or call to active-duty
status. No recertification requirements will apply to qualifying exigency leaves.

**Military Caregiver Certification –** When leave is taken due to a servicemember with a serious illness or
injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty who is your spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin,
the employee should provide certification completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered
servicemember or the travel orders issued to the employee on behalf of the servicemember. No
recertification requirements will apply to military caregiver leaves.

**Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave** – Leave taken because of the serious health condition of either
you or a covered family member may be taken on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis if such an
arrangement is certified by the health care provider to be medically necessary or to provide care or
psychological comfort to a covered relation with a serious health condition, as certified by the health care
provider. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may also be taken for a qualifying exigency or for military
caregiver leave of absence. An employee who needs an intermittent or reduced work schedule leave must
attempt to schedule leave so as not to disrupt the Company’s operations. Leave taken due to the birth of a
child or placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care must be taken in one consecutive period
unless approved in advance by the Human Resources Representative. Decisions regarding requests for
intermittent or reduced work schedule leaves in birth, adoption or foster care situations will be based on the
business need of the Company. During any period in which you are on an intermittent or reduced work
schedule, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an alternative position with equivalent pay and
benefits that better accommodates the recurring leave.

**Designation of Leave** – Once the company has acquired enough information to determine whether the
leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason (e.g., after receiving complete and sufficient
certification), the Human Resources Representative will provide a designation notice within five business
days to the employee stating whether or not FMLA leave has been approved. Additionally, the designation
notice will include applicable information regarding amount of leave entitlement, paid/unpaid time off,
fitness-for-duty certification requirements, certification deficiencies, etc. If a FMLA-qualifying reason is
determined by the Company to exist, the Human Resources Representative may designate leave as FMLA
whether the employee specifically requests FMLA designation or not. Employees cannot request that the
Company waive an FMLA leave designation if the leave qualifies as a bona-fide FMLA leave.

**Notification During the Leave** – You must contact the Restaurant Support Center at least weekly in order
for the Company to remain aware of your progress and anticipated longevity of the leave of absence. You
must notify the Restaurant Support Center at least two days prior to your expected date of return, or if you
will not be able to return when expected. Failure to do so may result in denial or delay of the leave or
restoration of employment. If you decide to voluntarily terminate employment, the General Manager
should be notified as soon as possible. If you fail to return to work on the next workday following the
expiration of the leave, you will be deemed to have resigned employment .

**Return From Leave** – When the reason for a family or medical leave ends (for example, a serious health
condition no longer exists), you are no longer eligible for leave under this policy and are expected to return

---

to work promptly. When leave is taken due to your own serious health condition, a release from the health
care provider will be required prior to your return to work, certifying that you are fit to return to work and
can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodations. You are
expected to return to work immediately following the health care provider’s release.

**Reinstatement** – This leave provides that you will be able to return to your former position or an equivalent
position, with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, if you
return to work within the 12-week period (or 26-week period for military caregiver leave), or at the
conclusion of the need for the leave.

There are limited circumstances in which you may not be reinstated from leave (e.g., in the event
of a reduction-in-force.) You have no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and
conditions of employment than if you had not been on FMLA leave.

Additionally, employees who are considered “key employees” under the provisions of the Act may
be denied reinstatement if the reinstatement would result in substantial and grievous economic
injury to company operations and if the employee was provided the appropriate notice, stating
such, at the commencement of his/her leave. A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible
employee who is among the highest paid 10% of the company’s entire workforce within 75 miles
of the employee’s worksite.

If you do not return to work within the 12-week (or 26-week) period or when the reason for the leave ends,
whichever occurs first, your position may be terminated, and you must then follow the normal job
application procedures required of external candidates in order to reapply for the position.

**Employment Benefits** – Taking a leave may not result in the loss of any employment benefit available
before the date that the leave started.

**Paid Time Off** – No sick leave or vacation days are earned during the unpaid leave period.

**Insurance Continuation** – During the leave, you will be permitted to retain your current medical insurance
coverage as specified in the provisions of the Company’s policy, subject to you paying your portion of the
cost of the insurance coverage. You should contact the Human Resources Department to find out when to
submit your payments.

You will be responsible for repayment of any premium costs borne by the Company for continuation of
insurance during the leave should you fail to return to work at the conclusion of the leave period for reasons
other than a serious health condition which qualifies under the leave provisions or other circumstances
beyond your control.

**Termination of Leave** – Leave may not be provided, or you may not be restored to employment if you
advise the Company that you will not return to work, in which case the employment relationship is deemed
terminated and your entitlement to reinstatement, continued leave, and health benefits cease. Likewise, if
an employee fraudulently obtains leave or accepts other employment while on leave without the prior
written approval of the Human Resources Manager, the employee will not be entitled to benefits under this
policy and employment may be terminated.

In the event of a divorce, legal separation, a child losing dependent status under the plan(s), or the
birth or placement of a child with you for adoption, you must inform the Human Resources

---

Representative within 60 days of the occurrence of the qualifying event. Failure to provide written
notification of such a qualifying event within the 60-day period will result in loss of the right to
continuation coverage.

**OUR GROUP INSURANCE PLAN**

The Company offers Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance for eligible managers and employees. The
company may pay a portion of the cost of these benefits. Specific information about coverage and cost is
available through the Human Resources Department.

Optional life insurance is available for spouses and children of covered employees, and you must pay the
cost for this dependent life insurance coverage.

An information booklet and I.D. card will be provided to you upon enrollment in the insurance coverage;
please contact the Human Resources Department for more information.

**CONTINUING INSURANCE COVERAGE (COBRA)**

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provides that you and covered family
members may be eligible to temporarily extend your medical insurance coverage at group rates in certain
instances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end. You may also be eligible for state-mandated
continuation rights after COBRA coverage ends. You will receive information about your rights under
COBRA upon enrollment in the medical insurance plan. For additional information regarding COBRA or
to provide notification of a qualifying event for COBRA coverage, contact the Restaurant Support Center.

**ON-THE-JOB INJURIES – WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE**

Workers’ compensation insurance is maintained by the company to provide compensation to employees for
loss of wages due to injury or illness that occurs in or as a result of employment and also pays necessary
related medical expenses, according to applicable state law.

In the State of Texas, you may elect to decline such coverage if, no later than five days after beginning
employment, you notify the Human Resources Representative in writing that you wish to retain your
common law right of action. In such an instance, you would not be covered by the insurance plan and
would not be able to obtain workers’ compensation income or medical benefits in the event of a job-related
injury or accident. If you decline workers’ compensation insurance coverage, your employment may be
terminated immediately, as coverage under workers’ compensation insurance is a condition of employment
with the company.

**All job-related injuries and accidents, regardless of the need for medical attention or severity of the**
**injury or illness, must be reported immediately to the Manager-In-Charge. Failure to do so may**
**result in non-payment of medical services. The Manager-In-Charge is responsible for reporting any**
**work-related accident, illness, or injury immediately to the GM. Failure to comply with B&G**
**accident reporting procedures can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of**
**employment.**

The Company will require an alcohol or drug test if you are involved in a work-related accident.

It is expected that all employees are truthful in the reporting of work-related injuries. Workers’
compensation fraud occurs when someone willfully makes a false statement or conceals information in
order to receive workers’ compensation benefits or prevents someone from receiving benefits to which they

---

might be entitled. This organization will not tolerate fraud. If you think workers’ compensation fraud is
occurring, notify the Manager, VP, Senior Staff, Human Resources Department, or the Owner at (985) 384-
3333 so that an investigation may occur.

The Company will follow the provisions of its *Family and Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA)* policy when
administering leave due to on-the-job injuries. If you are eligible for such leave and are unable to perform
the duties and responsibilities of your position, you may receive up to 12 weeks of leave as described in the
FMLA policy. If you are injured on-the-job and are unable to perform your regular duties and
responsibilities as a result of an on-the-job injury, and you do not qualify under the policy, the Company
reserves the right to replace you after you have missed seven consecutive days of work. If you are replaced,
you may reapply for employment, following the same job application procedures required of external
candidates, after receiving a full release to return to work from a qualified health care provider.

**BEREAVEMENT LEAVE**

The Company will provide time off without pay for you to attend the funeral of immediate family members
(i.e., your parents, brothers, sisters, spouse, or children and corresponding in-law and/or step relations).
The General Manager may approve up to two (2) consecutive calendar days off, at his or her discretion.
Management employees must receive advance approval from their Director of Operations. If unpaid time
is approved, employees may substitute vacation for unpaid time.

The Company may approve one day off to attend the funeral of non-immediate family members (i.e.,
grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins) or a friend. Vacation leave cannot be substituted to
attend the funeral of a non-immediate family member.

**JURY DUTY**

Employees are permitted the necessary time off for mandatory jury duty, or to appear in court as required
by a valid subpoena or court order. Non-salaried employees will receive one day of paid time off if jury
duty or a valid court appearance occurs during the employee’s regular scheduled work time. Salaried
employees are paid their regular salary for service on a jury for up to ten days without effect on benefits
but must submit any jury duty fees received. You are expected to report for work when it does not conflict
with court requirements. The company will not compensate time off for court appearances as a party to
any civil or criminal litigation, unless required by applicable law. You must arrange for time off without
pay or use available vacation for such appearances.

**MILITARY LEAVE**

**Uniformed Services Covered** – Employees who are members of a uniformed service or who make
application for membership in a uniformed service will be given the required time off for the performance
of duty.

**Compensation** – Military leave is generally considered unpaid leave. However, you may voluntarily use
any available vacation during all or part of this period.

**Required Notification** – You must provide your General Manager with notice of your need for leave and
the Company requests that you do so at least 30 days prior to the need for the leave, or as soon as possible
upon receipt of the orders. Failure to provide adequate notice may result in a denial of reemployment.
Upon receipt of notice of your need for leave, the Company will provide you with additional information
regarding your rights and responsibilities while on leave.

---

Failure to report for work or to submit an application for reemployment within the allotted time, or to advise
your General Manager of a delay due to extenuating circumstances subjects you to the Company’s policies
regarding unauthorized absences.

You should contact your General Manager with any questions you have regarding this policy.

**MISCELLANEOUS LEAVES OF ABSENCE**

Based upon applicable state law requirements, you may be permitted time off of work for qualifying
reasons, including school involvement leave, day care visits, bone marrow donations, additional time off
for pregnancy-related absences, and medical appointments necessary to meet the requirements to obtain
veteran benefits. You should contact your General Manager to inquire as to whether any leave time is
available for you.

If you wish to take such time off, you must request the time off as soon as you know of your need for leave
and must follow the provisions provided to you by your manager.

#### OPERATING

**OUR WORK HOURS**

You are responsible for knowing the work hours of the restaurant where you work. The workday begins
two hours before the restaurant opens and ends approximately one hour after closing. Crew members are
to work the hours determined and scheduled by the General Manager.

**YOUR WORK SCHEDULE**

Work schedules for crew members are made up each week to fit the restaurant’s operating needs. Schedules
are posted a minimum of one week in advance for the following week. You must give the General Manager
advance written notice of any pending changes in your availability or inability to work specific times prior
to the posting of that schedule. Schedules can only be changed in an emergency, at the discretion of the
General Manager.

You are expected to report to work no earlier than 10 minutes before your scheduled work time, uniformed
and ready to begin work. You are expected to leave the restaurant within 15 minutes after clocking out.
You may eat in the restaurant immediately prior to or immediately after your shift.

**WORKSTATIONS**

Each of our workstations encompasses a particular area of our restaurant and includes a wide variety of
jobs. To minimize confusion, each station has been divided into substations where you can concentrate on
smaller groups of job tasks at one time.

You will be assigned a work position based on the immediate needs of your restaurant. Any additional
training will be determined by the business needs of the restaurant and by your performance.

We have found that the closest teamwork is achieved when everyone understands each person’s job. For
that reason, you may eventually be trained at several stations. Your General Manager will follow your
progress at each station. Together you will decide when you are ready to move to the next training step.

**CASH REGISTER POLICY**

Because of the important and sensitive nature of a cashier’s job, you are expected to **READ AND**
**UNDERSTAND** this policy for both your protection and ours.

- Your shift is to be started with a clean cash drawer. You will always start your shift with a minimum
of $50 in coins and bills. The money in your drawer must be counted by the Manager-in-Charge
prior to you using the register. You must agree with the count of the Manager-in-Charge and
document and initial such on the provided register currency form.

- You are to use only the register drawer assigned to you. **Do not permit anyone else to use your**
**drawer.** Perform only one transaction at a time. Close the drawer after each transaction.

- Once a guest’s order is complete, changes to the order may be made only by the Manager-in-
Charge.

---

- Do not make change between register drawers or for guests. This is the responsibility of the
Manager-in-Charge.

- If guests challenge their change, immediately call the Manager-in-Charge. The Manager-in-Charge
will immediately count down the drawer with you.

- All bills larger than $20 must be approved by the Manager-in-Charge before being accepted.

- After you finish your shift, you and the Manager will close, counting and cashing out your drawer
together. You and the manager must both proceed to the safe and drop the money into the time
delay section of the safe. ***Your responsibility for the cash does not end until the cash drop has***
***been made.***

- It is a serious violation of company policy to under-charge or pass food across the counter without
payment. Any such incident is considered willful theft of property and may result in disciplinary
action, up to and including immediate termination.

- If you have more than a $1.00 overage or shortage in your register drawer per shift, this may result
in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination, in addition to possible criminal
action.

- **All $20.00 bills and larger currency are to be placed in the drop safe immediately upon**
**receipt.**

- “Bumping” orders off the order monitor before actual delivery voids the accuracy of delivery
service time data and may result in immediate termination.

- Accepting tips while on duty as a cashier is violation of company policy.

- Any change mistakenly left by a customer must be immediately reported to the Manager-in-Charge.

**LOUISIANA MINOR VIOLATION TERMINATION POLICY:**

- No one under 16 years old can be employed.

- No minor will be allowed to start work or go through orientation without a valid LA work permit.

- 16-year-olds will not be allowed to work past 10:30 pm on school nights. (earlier at parents’ request)

- 17-year-olds will not be allowed to work past 11:30 pm on school nights. (earlier at parents’ request)

- No minor will be allowed to work before 5 am or without 8 hours between shifts.

**The Company’s Louisiana Minor Break Policy is a mandatory uninterrupted break of 35 minutes**
**after no more than 4 hours of work.**

The Company values each employee that works with us to serve our customers. As employees under the
age of 18 comprise a major percentage of our restaurant teams, the Louisiana Minor Break Policy for
employees less than 18 years old will be strictly enforced.

The Company’s policy is above and beyond Louisiana State Law to assure that our minor employees are
given the appropriate amount of rest as required by law.

**Louisiana State Law requires an uninterrupted 30-minute break after no more than 5 hours.**

We cannot accomplish the goal of our Minor Break Policy without each minor employee taking
responsibility to take his or her breaks according to the policy. Because of the importance of complying
with the Company and Louisiana State Minor Break requirements the following disciplinary action will
follow when it comes to our attention that violations have occurred:

- **When it comes to our attention that B & G policy is broken, written documentation will be**
**recorded and placed in the Minor’s file. Repeated offences may lead to disciplinary action up**
**to and including termination.**

- **When it comes to our attention that Louisiana State Minor Policy is broken, the minor will be**
**terminated immediately. The minor will be eligible for rehire after his or her 18** **^th^** **birthday.**

We do not want anyone to be surprised if his/her employment is terminated! Better yet, we do not want
to lose any of our minors because they did not take this policy seriously.

**B & G MINOR VIOLATION POLICY**

MIC’s will also be held responsible for any minor break policy violations taking place when they are in the
store. (1) The **first violation** will result in a formal write up. (2) The **second violation** (within 60 days)
will result in written warning. (3) **The third** violation (within 90 days) will result in 1day suspension with
no pay.

GM’s who might not be present in the restaurant at the time a minor violation takes place will still be held
responsible for his/her stores enforcement of the policy. (1) The GM will be written up. (2) The **second**
**violation** (within 60 days) will also result in a write up. (3) The **third violation** (within 90 days) will also
result in a write up.

**LOUISIANA STATE MINOR VIOLATION POLICY**

Any minor who violates the state’s minor break policy will receive a written warning for his/her first
violation. If a minor commits a second state policy violation, he/she will be suspended for one week with
no pay. If a minor commits a third state policy violation, he/she will be terminated immediately.

**Louisiana State Minor Violation Policy regarding GM’s, AGM’s, and Shift Leaders:** If a state minor
violation is committed the MIC will receive a written warning and a one-day suspension without pay. If a
MIC received his/her second minor violation within 30 days of the first they will receive 1 week suspension
with no pay.

GM’s who are not present at the time a minor violation occurs will receive the following disciplinary action:
(1) A written warning for the first state violation. (2) If a second state policy is broken within 30 days of
the first the GM will be suspended one-day without pay. (3) If a third minor violation is committed within
60 days of the first violation the GM will be suspended one-week without pay.

It is the Area Coach’s’ responsibility to ensure that there are no minor violations in their market. If minor
policies are not followed in a market, and if adequate procedures are not implemented and followed, the
Area Coach will be held responsible. After a written warning, the Area Coach risks being removed for
repeated violation.

Minors represent a vital part of our operations. Without them it would be next to impossible to run our
stores, but if we cannot manage this very important “Human Resource” we will be forced to abandon using
workers under the age of 18 because the financial constraints (fines up to $500 per infraction) will leave us
no alternative.

**TAKING A BREAK**

You are expected to take your breaks in the restaurant lobby only. The Manager-in-Charge will specify the
time for breaks.

If you are paid on an hourly basis, you are to record your time out for breaks and your time back in upon
return to work.

In cases where business volume suddenly increases and the Manager-in-Charge needs help from you while
on break, you are expected to help with the temporary workload. When the increase in volume has been
handled, the Manager-in-Charge will allow you to resume the break. If a meal is interrupted, it will be
replaced at no charge. (This policy does not include Louisiana Minors who must take an uninterrupted
break.)

In cases where business volume suddenly decreases, the Manager-in-Charge may ask you to clock out and
leave the premises.

**MEAL POLICY**

*(Discounted meals can be authorized by the Area Coach.)*

**Employee:** Meals for employees are at full price, unless authorized by the Area Coach. If your restaurant
qualifies for half price meals the following rules apply:

---

- When you are in uniform immediately prior to or immediately after your shift, you may be eligible to
receive discounted meals. This policy also applies to you when you are on your breaks. This does not
apply to spouses, relatives, or friends. Violations to this policy are considered theft and will be reason
for termination and possible criminal action. Discounted meals for crew are allowed at one of the
times, before, during, or after a shift, not at all three occasions in one day.

- All employee orders must be rung up under Manager-in-Charge observation, and orders must be taken
from the lobby. Any discounted or free food must have your legible signatures as well as the signatures
of the Manager-in-Charge.

- The fountain beverages are provided free to you while on duty. Drinking at your workstation is a
violation of Health Department guidelines.

**Salaried Managers:** Managers receive one meal free while on duty. This does not apply to meals at any
other restaurant in the district. This does not apply to spouses, relatives, or friends. Violations to this policy
are considered theft and will be reason for termination and possible criminal action. Managers must sign
all of their food and drink receipts.

**Senior Corporate Management:** Senior management of B&G Food Enterprises and a guest may receive
free meals and drinks at any time. Receipts must be signed by the senior manager on duty.

**Police Officers in Uniform:** Local uniformed police officers & state police, while on duty, may receive
discounts; discounts may vary from store to store. Receipts must have badge numbers as well as signature
of the officer and Manager-in-Charge (These discount sales to uniformed law enforcement personnel are
encouraged, and these sales should be consumed on the premises). ****NOTE:** This does not apply to
firemen, security guards, or ambulance attendants. This privilege does not pertain to the police officer’s
spouse, relatives, or friends.

**Meal Procedures:**

- Employee must have permission of the Manager-in-Charge.

- Discounts will only be allowed immediately before a shift **or** after a shift **or** during a break.

- There will be no orders to go.

- Employee meals are to be consumed in the lobby area only.

- Food must be ordered over the counter, just as with a customer.

- Orders will consist of standard menu items and be prepared by another crew member.

- The employee meal ticket must be signed by the employee and the Manager-in-Charge.

- There will be no eating anywhere behind the front counter.

**ABSENTEEISM AND TARDINESS**

You are expected to be at your work area and ready to begin work at your assigned starting time. If you
are going to be absent or late, you must notify the Manager-in-Charge as soon as possible, but no later than
2 hours before the start of your scheduled shift, as to the reason for and anticipated length of your absence
or tardiness. You must speak directly to the Manager-in-Charge unless prior arrangements have been made

---

with the manager for other acceptable ways to communicate that you will be absent or tardy (i.e., text
message, speaking with another designated person, leaving a voice mail message, etc.). In the event you
must leave work unexpectedly, you are to notify your manager or appropriate designee as soon as the need
arises.

Absences or tardiness occurring more than twice in the same week may be grounds for termination.

**WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD**

Stores will usually be open even during severe weather. If the restaurant is open, you are expected to show
up for scheduled shifts. Failure to come to work results in no pay for scheduled shifts.

The Area Coach will determine whether a Restaurant will open in the event of severe weather. You should
contact your General Manager to verify if the Restaurant will be open. If you do not plan to come to work,
you should contact the General Manager.

Stores may be closed during hurricanes, flooding, extremely low temperatures, and/or snow or ice.

**BUSINESS CONFIDENTIALITY**

Safeguarding the confidential nature of information concerning the company’s financial data, future
business plans, transactions, trade secrets, technology, present and prospective customers, specialized
business processes, suppliers, intellectual property, internal controls, and methods to improve efficiency
and workforce morale and cohesion is essential to the company’s present and future ability to succeed in a
highly competitive business environment. Other people or companies should not unfairly benefit from the
company’s competitive confidential information. The need to protect the company’s competitive
confidential information should not be misinterpreted as chilling the right of employees to communicate
about their wages, hours and working conditions.

The need to protect the company’s competitive confidential information also should not be misinterpreted
as inhibiting the company’s use of its own information. However, caution and discretion are required in
the use of such information and in sharing it only when required in the normal course of business. While
the company’s normal operations require the full flow of information throughout the organization,
confidential information available to one department or division of the company should be communicated
to other departments or divisions only when required in the normal course of business.

Confidential information obtained as a result of employment with the company is not to be used as a means
of obtaining personal gain or for the private use of others. Researching information from company records
about customers for non-business-related reasons is prohibited. Use or disclosure of such knowledge or
information in an inappropriate manner can result in civil and/or criminal penalties, both for the employee
and for the company.

Only authorized company representatives are to communicate with the public on behalf of the company.
Events may occur that will draw immediate attention from the news media. It is imperative that authorized
company representatives communicate on behalf of the company to deliver an appropriate message and to
avoid giving misinformation in any media inquiry. All media inquiries regarding company affairs must be
referred to the Owner. This policy is intended to control the company’s official message and not to restrict
employee communications about wages, hours, and working conditions.

---

**SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEE PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION**

It is the Company’s intent to safeguard employee personal and private information. Examples of personal
information include social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, emergency
contact information, medical information or any other personal or private information to which the public
does not have general access, or which may directly identify an individual. In the course of performing
their job duties, some employees may have access to gain the personal and private information of other
employees (i.e., setting up payroll, medical benefits, etc.). These employees are expected to only use such
information in the course of performing their job. It is expected that all employees maintain confidentiality
of the personal or private information of other employees. Employee personal or private information may
only be released for business-related reasons on a need-to-know basis with approval from the Human
Resources Representative, or as required by applicable law.

**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

You should recognize your responsibility to avoid any conflict between your personal interest and those of
the Company’s business interests. A conflict of interest exists when you, knowingly or unknowingly,
engage in any activity that may compromise you, another employee, or the company in its relationship with
a customer, vendor, or competitor. Also, a conflict of interest occurs when the Company’s interests
interfere, or appear to interfere, with your ability to make sound business decisions on behalf of the
Company. Nothing in this policy is to be interpreted as applying to concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection under the National Labor Relations Act.

You are prohibited from engaging in any activity, practice, or act which conflicts with, or appears to conflict
with, the interests of the Company, its customers, or vendors. Full disclosure should be made to the
Manager-in-Charge of any potential conflict of interest, before it occurs, is required.

You should not have additional employment in a competitive restaurant or other business which could
interfere with your ability to work or to provide your best performance for the Company, and such
employment must never result in a conflict of interest. You should inform you Manager-in-Charge if you
decide to obtain employment in addition to your job with the Company.

Additionally, personal relationships which may result in a conflict of interest are discouraged and, as such,
employees must comply with the following policies:

- **Employees are not permitted to fraternize socially with fellow employees, if such personal**
**relationships would result in conflicts of any type.**

- **It is not permitted for a Manager to fraternize out-side of the workplace with an employee under**
**his or her authority.**

- **It is not permitted for any Manager to give a ride to an employee under his or her authority.**

**EMPLOYEE DATING**

Dating between employees is discouraged by company management. If such relationships occur and create
any type of disruption in the workplace, the company reserves the right to transfer or terminate one or both
employees involved.

Managers and supervisory personnel are prohibited from dating or engaging in intimate personal
relationships with employees reporting to them either directly or indirectly.

---

**GRATUITIES**

You cannot receive gifts in any form from customers, supplies, or servicing organizations. Neither may
you give, pay, promise, or offer to customers anything of value for the purpose of securing or appearing to
secure personal preferential treatment. If offered any type of gratuity, you should politely explain that you
are not allowed to accept gratuities.

Special program offers to vendors, service people, school, and other groups, and offers of discount sales to
uniformed, on-duty law enforcement personnel are not included in the above statement. Only Company
managers may key in discount sales.

**YOUR IMAGE IS OUR IMAGE**

You were hired to work here because of the excellent impression that you made. We feel that you represent
the qualities, motivation, and responsible attitude to become an integral part of our team. We have worked
very hard to establish the positive image that Taco Bell has in this community. Several things have
contributed to that: a high-quality product priced for a good value, comfortable and clean surroundings and
most importantly, top notch people, such as you, providing friendly, efficient service.

Our image is very critical to our success, so we have very high expectations of all our crew members in
terms of appearance, performance, and behavior. We have hired you to represent us to the public. Your
appearance and attitude send a message to our customers and has a major impact on their decisions to dine
at our restaurant.

**Appearance**

You represent our Company image with your appearance. Our guests expect our crew members to have a
clean-cut look whenever they visit us. In order to remain consistent from restaurant to restaurant and from
day to day, no matter when or where our guests visit us, it is important that you follow the Company
guidelines.

**Attire**

- You are to dress in the designated uniform with appropriate undergarments. Undergarments are not to
be visible.

- Uniforms and other clothing articles are to be clean and wrinkle free before arriving for work.

- Clean, well-maintained shoes, socks and belts are to be worn at all times while at work.

- Non-uniform sweaters are not to be worn.

- Uniform hats are to be worn to keep hair away from your face. No bandanas are permitted to be worn.

- REMEMBER…the uniform is never complete without A SMILE!

**Grooming and Personal Hygiene**

- You are expected to have bathed, applied deodorant, and be clean before starting a shift. Remain free
of excessive or distracting odors such as body odor, excessive fragrances, tobacco odor, etc.
Cosmetics, aftershave, and cologne may be worn in conservative amounts and in good taste.

---

- **Exposed cuts, blemishes or lesions are to be bandaged with a blue bandage supplied by the**
**Company and, if on the hands, you are also required to wear plastic surgical-type gloves**
**provided by the Company.**

- No visible body piercing except post earrings that are non-distractive and conservative in nature. Studearrings no bigger than ¼” and no more than 2 per ear, nose ring or studs and backings are also
acceptable.

- Hands are to be washed with soap and hot water before handling food.

- Jewelry that may be hazardous around equipment should not be worn. A wedding band may be worn
while on duty. Dangling earrings are not permitted. Nose rings or any other body jewelry are not
allowed to be worn while at work.

- **Fingernails are to be neat, clean, trimmed, and unpolished. Artificial fingernails are not to be**
**worn.**

- Hair should be clean, combed and neatly trimmed or arranged. Unkempt hair is not permitted. Hair
should be pulled back from the eyes and face.

- Beards are not permitted unless a reasonable accommodation is requested for medical or religious
reasons.

Reasonable accommodations will be made for your religious beliefs consistent with business necessity to
present a conservative, professional appearance to the public. If your religion requires you to wear
particular attire, you should make a request for this accommodation to your manager in writing. The
company will accommodate employees’ religious attire unless such accommodation is not reasonable or
practical, or it causes an undue hardship on company operations or creates an unsafe working condition.

**UNIFORMS**

Uniforms are supplied by the Company. This includes a shirt, hat and visor. B&G offers a payroll advance
plan for you to purchase black “Slip-resistant Shoes” called Shoes for Crews. They are regarded as the best
non-slip shoes in the restaurant industry. If you decide not to take advantage of our Shoes for Crews Payroll
Deduction Program, you cannot start work unless you have slip-resistant soles. Shoes with “Non Slip” on
the soles are not acceptable. For safety reasons, wearing open-toe or cloth shoes is not allowed. If you **lose**
or **damage** any part of your uniform, you will be charged for the cost of the replacement uniform part.
Upon termination, all uniforms parts must be turned in to the office. If all uniform parts are not turned in,
you will be charged for them.

You are responsible for maintaining your uniform and returning it in good condition if you leave. You are
also responsible for providing and maintaining your own black socks, black or dark brown belt and black
pants.

Because of the desire to stay uniform, the following criteria must be followed when purchasing pants:

- An easy-fitting tailored pant is recommended in a woven, cotton/polyester blend.

- Pants must be black and not faded. Dark blue or black jeans are allowed.

---

- Elastic waist or belted pants may be worn. If pants have belt loops, a belt **must** be worn.

- Pants must fit properly, not snuggly, so shirts can be tucked in.

- Baggy pants are not allowed.

- No leggings, tights, or stirrup pants allowed.

- Pants must be full length and reach the top of the shoe worn. Cuffs may be worn if they are sewn in.

Uniforms are wash and wear. Uniform care starts with machine laundering. Use wash and wear, durable
press, or knit/delicate cycle. Set water for warm, not hot, temperature, and do not use bleach. If heavily
soiled, soak the uniform overnight in warm water containing a few tablespoons of detergent. Do not use
hot water, bleach, or spray chemical stain removers on uniforms.

For stains, pour liquid detergent on the spot and rub gently with your hand for a few minutes. Use of a non-
abrasive pre-soak may help with stain removal. Let the garment stand and then rinse with warm water or
wash as above. Uniforms may also be dry cleaned from time to time.

**Dry uniforms at low heat settings.** Remove the uniform immediately from the dryer and place on hangers
to avoid ironing. If an iron must be used, set the temperature to cool. Wash hats by hand or use a machine
setting of cool. Air-dry the hat, rather than drying in a clothes dryer.

**PERSONAL PROPERTY**

The Company is not liable for loss or damage to personal property. Care should be taken in securing your
belongings. Any personal property, including purses, wallets, vehicles, etc. is your responsibility.

**TELEPHONE USE**

In emergency situations, the restaurant telephone may be used by employees and on-duty law enforcement
officers, but only with the permission of management. Calls should be limited to two minutes. Calls to
crew members on duty are not permitted except in case of emergency. Messages for crew members will be
taken by the Manager-in-Charge. Cell phones are not permitted in the restaurant unless provided by B&G
Foods for business-related reasons.

In other cases of emergency where use of the phone is required, the Manager-in-Charge will make the call
needed for the person (s) requiring help, and in no case will anyone else be allowed back area access for
such purposes.

Only individuals who have been “Phone Certified” are permitted to answer the phone.

**BULLETIN BOARDS**

We communicate with you largely through bulletins sent to your Restaurant. Read the bulletin board (or
the areas where bulletins are posted) regularly for important information.

---

**VISITORS**

Personal visits by your friends or family should be kept to a minimum. Although your friends and family
are always welcome to be customers in the restaurant, their presence should not interrupt your work or that
of your co-workers. In no case are visitors to the restaurant permitted in secured areas or behind the counter.

**SPECIAL EVENTS**

Periodically, the Company sponsors special events like annual incentive trips for management and
restaurant management and staff contests to increase sales, promote special or new menu item(s), or
improve customer service, restaurant cleanliness, etc. Sometimes these special events and contests include
awards and prizes which you may be eligible to win. Your Manager will inform you when a special event
begins.

**HARASSMENT**

The Company will not tolerate harassment of individuals for any reason, and particularly harassment on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender
identity), age, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or armed forces status or any other status
protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws will not be permitted or condoned. Comments, conduct,
and innuendoes that might be perceived by others as offensive or harassing are wholly inappropriate and
are prohibited.

In addition, the Company will not tolerate the harassment of Company personnel by non-personnel on
Company premises. Non-personnel include, but are not limited to, customers, vendors, and regulators.

Harassment is considered conduct which is focused on a person or group of persons including, but not
limited to, physical or verbal abuse, unwelcome activity of a sexual nature, retaliation, as well as any
behavior or action which interferes with an employee’s ability to perform assignments or which creates a
hostile or intimidating work environment.

The following are various types of harassment which are prohibited and will not be tolerated and may result
in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

- **Inappropriate Communication** – Involves any language which is unnecessarily loud or degrades or
berates others, including but not limited to, racial, religious, or sexual comments or jokes, sexual
innuendoes, inappropriate personal questions, or threats of any kind, whether communicated verbally,
in writing or electronically. This also involves inappropriate written materials including, but not
limited to, texts, pictures, letters, email messages, social media, texts, graffiti, etc.

- **Physical Contact** – Includes inappropriate touching, hitting, kicking, or threatening another person,
including restraining by force, or blocking the path of another.

- **Interference or Hostile Environment** – Includes any behavior or action which interferes with an
employee’s ability to perform job duties or responsibilities, or which results in or creates a hostile or
intimidating work environment.

- **Sexual Harassment** – Includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
acts or favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

---

- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
individual’s employment;

- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment
decisions affecting such individual; or

- such conduct is severe and pervasive and has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
the individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work
environment.

- **Retaliation** – Includes any adverse action or threat of adverse action taken or made because an
employee has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the employment laws of the United
States or an individual state, or under the policies of the Company.

Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, threats of or actual materially adverse employment actions,
such as withholding or withdrawal of pay, promotions, training, or other employment
opportunities.

Any employee who feels he or she has been subjected to any type or degree of harassment is to immediately
report the incident to the Manager, VP, Senior Staff, or Human Resources Department at (985) 384-3333.
A complaint should include the specific nature of the harassment and the date(s) and place(s) such
harassment took place, as well as the name of the individual(s) involved.

Complaints of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation policy violations will be promptly and
carefully investigated, including interviews with all relevant persons. Investigators will conduct
an objective investigation that strikes a balance between the company’s need to conduct a full
investigation and an employee’s desire for privacy. The company limits its dissemination of
information regarding the complaint(s) and resulting investigation only to individuals with a
legitimate “need to know”.

Any employee found to have violated the harassment policy will be disciplined, up to and including
termination.

Any employee who utilizes this procedure can be assured that he or she will be free from any and all reprisal
or retaliation from filing such complaints. Investigators will make every effort to strike a balance between
the parties’ desires for privacy and the need to conduct a fair and effective investigation; however, no
employee is guaranteed complete confidentiality and/or anonymity during an investigation.

**ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION**

You are prohibited from consuming, possessing, or being under the influence of alcohol on Company
premises, or while engaging in Company business. Intoxication will not be permitted, and if you are
intoxicated or appear to be intoxicated, you will be subject to disciplinary action. In the event you find
yourself in a situation in which alcoholic beverages are being consumed at an event sponsored by the
Company or where your attendance is funded by the Company, you may consume alcohol in moderation
so as not to reflect poorly on the Company’s reputation or expose the Company to legal liability involving
your safety or the safety of others. Alcohol consumption should not lead to impaired performance,
inappropriate behavior, endangerment of the safety of any individual, or violation of any applicable law.
After consuming alcohol at such a function, you should not drive or otherwise engage in any hazardous
activity.

---

**SUBSTANCE ABUSE**

The Company conducts its business with a high regard for the health and safety of its employees, the
protection of its assets, and the maintenance of a productive work environment. Practices which obstruct
or inhibit these objectives are unacceptable. Therefore, the Company requires you to perform your job
duties unimpaired by prohibited substances. You are prohibited from using, being under the influence,
possessing, purchasing, dispensing, distributing, or manufacturing any illegal drug on Company premises,
while performing services for the Company, or during working hours.

“Illegal drug” refers to any drug which (1) cannot be legally obtained; (2) can be legally obtained but was
not legally obtained; or (3) is being used in a manner or for a purpose other than that for which it was
prescribed or manufactured. This definition includes any controlled substances; any other drugs, the
manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, or purchase of which is unlawful under state or
federal law; and inhalants.

Company premises include all of B&G Food’s property, offices, facilities, land, buildings, structures,
fixtures, installations, automobiles, trucks, and all other vehicles and equipment, whether owned, leased, or
used. This policy also includes all customer properties, areas under the Company’s control, and any other
work locations during working time or outside working time while in the course and scope of Company
employment or on Company business.

The use or being under the influence of a legal drug on the Company’s premises, while performing services
for the Company, or during working hours also is prohibited if such use might impair in any manner your
ability to safely, efficiently, and competently perform your job, or might otherwise adversely affect the
Company in the conduct of its business operations. Improper use of legal drugs refers to the use of
prescription medication and/or over-the-counter medication which are legally obtained but which are not
being used solely in a manner and for the purpose for which they were prescribed or manufactured. If using
such a legal drug, you must carry only the reasonable amount which is needed for a work shift and shall not
allow any other person to consume the medication. Additionally, at the time of a drug test, you must reveal
to the testing facility any prescription or nonprescription drug which you may be using.

**DRUG TESTS**

Pursuant to the Alcohol Consumption and Substance Abuse policies outlines above, and in an effort to

basis with an equal probability that any employee will be selected.

Additionally, an employee may be required to undergo follow-up testing pursuant to a rehabilitation

**OUR DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES**

Generally, most discipline problems can be resolved in the early stages. However, depending upon the
nature and severity of the problem, the Company may enact any disciplinary measure (verbal or written
notice, probation, or termination) at any time, without progressing through each stage of the normal
procedures. The following disciplinary actions will generally be used in handling unacceptable
performance or behavior.

- **Verbal Warning** – The Manager-in-Charge may discuss unacceptable performance or behavior
with you. The discussion will indicate the nature of the problem and the action necessary to correct
it.

- **Written Warning** – When a problem continues despite a verbal warning, the Manager-in-Charge
may prepare a written warning to be discussed with you.

- **Probation Period** – A probation period (normally 30 days) may be incorporated in either the first
or a subsequent written warning. You should realize that probation is the final step prior to
termination should improvement in performance or conduct fail to be achieved within the
probationary period.

- **Termination** – If prior disciplinary action fails to resolve the problem, the General Manager will
document a recommendation for termination of employment. You will then be notified of the

---

termination by the General Manager. Certain actions may result in immediate termination of
employment, without prior disciplinary action.

**WHEN SUSPENSION BECOMES NECESSARY**

A suspension without pay may be justified when circumstances reasonably require an investigation of a
serious incident in which you have allegedly been involved. Suspension without pay may be imposed for
such proven misconduct as intentional violation of work or safety rules.

**IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM**

We are committed to treating all employees fairly and honestly. Our success depends upon the results of
individual and team efforts, and each employee’s satisfaction with his or her job. You are encouraged to
talk to the General Manager or the Manager-in-Charge if a problem arises in the work environment.

If the problem is not resolved by the General Manager or Manager-in-Charge, you may ask for a meeting
with the Area Coach and/or Director of Operations and General Manager or Manager-in-Charge in an effort
to work things out. If the problem is still unresolved, you may ask to meet with the President.

#### SAFETY

**SECURITY**

The security of the Company is every employee’s responsibility. The Company takes a very positive
approach when security matters arise. You should discuss with the Manager-in-Charge and/or the Director
of Operations any problem which may arise with regard to security.

The back door of every restaurant should always have its alarm on and be locked. The back door should
never be opened after dark. **Under no circumstances is anyone not working allowed in the restaurant**
**before or after business hours. This includes off-duty crew, family, and friends. Violation of this**
**important safety procedure will needlessly endanger the lives of your co-workers and may result in**
**your immediate termination.**

Security policies and devices should not be discussed with anyone outside the Company. You are
responsible for understanding and following the Company’s established security procedures. A violation
of the safety policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Once the lobby is **closed** at night, **never open the door for anyone, including the owner** or any of B &
G’s Staff, unless they have made prior arrangements. Most robberies occur when employees allow someone
in after the lobby is locked.

**SAFETY IS IMPORTANT**

It is the Company’s policy to provide a safe and healthful workplace. Company safety procedures must be
followed at all times to ensure that crew members and guests enjoy safe restaurant conditions. It is your
responsibility to read and understand the safety policies located in each restaurant. The policies cover
information on restaurant equipment, knives, electrical, material handling, storage, employee
health/sanitation, building exterior, severe wind, fires, robbery, and vehicles and driving.

The safety policies apply to all employees. You are required to observe all safety rules and procedures,
properly use the safety equipment provided as required, practice safety at all times, not create any safety
hazards, and report all safety hazards to the Manager-in-Charge immediately.

You are to observe the safety rules contained in the safety program in every phase of your work. You are
required to participate in the safety effort of the Company by working safely and attending and participating
in safety sessions when offered. Safety sessions are held every quarter. Incidents involving personnel are
reviewed on a regular basis to identify any possible safety hazards. If you should have an incident or injury,
report it to your Manager-in-Charge immediately **no matter how insignificant it may seem.** If you seek
medical attention for a work-related injury, a drug screen is required during the first visit. B&G has
recommended medical facilities and are posted in each location. If you use another facility the General
Manager **MUST** be notified immediately. Your particular job requirement may include additional specific
safety guidelines which you are required to observe and practice, with no exceptions.

In the event of a community health crisis or infectious disease outbreak that impacts working, policies may
be created or adjusted to comply with recommendations of federal, state, and local health officials.

**INJURY CLAIMS**

Submitting fraudulent claims for injuries allegedly suffered on the job is prohibited and may result in
disciplinary action up to an including termination, as well as criminal penalties.

Any employee found to be withholding information regarding an alleged employee injury will be subject
to disciplinary action up to including termination.

**ACCIDENTS INVOLVING NON-EMPLOYEES**

It is the policy of the Company to deal quickly with any accident involving customers, suppliers, or service
personnel. The first and most important step is to care for any personal injury involved, and then
immediately to report all the relevant information, regardless of how minor the incident may seem at the
time to your Area Coach. In all cases, a B & G Incident Reporting Form must be filled out and sent to the
Restaurant Support Center immediately following the incident for immediate processing with the
appropriate agency or company. Do not hesitate to call for emergency assistance when necessary or when
requested by a non-employee involved in an accident. Any video, witness statements or any other valuable
information should be gathered and placed in a safe and secure place. It should then be given to the AC or
sent to the Restaurant Support Center.

**EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

In cases of emergency such as power failure, fire, storm damage or robbery, the Manager-in-Charge will
instruct employees and others present in the restaurant as to the appropriate course of action (see Employee
Safety Program). Reference procedures outlined in the Reference Manual and other emergency procedure
outlines will govern the actions and decisions of the Manager-in-Charge.

#### SEPARATION

**SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE US**

The Company requests that you give two weeks’ notice prior to the effective date of resignation. The
Company may permit you to continue employment during the two-week notice period or accept resignation
immediately. You will be entitled to receive all earned pay. Earned vacation may be paid for voluntary
resignations if two weeks’ notice is given and worked. If you do not provide and work through appropriate
notice of your resignation, or if your employment is terminated for any reason, you may not receive payment
for your accrued vacation. The exception for vacation is for employees in Louisiana who, in accordance
with Louisiana state law, will be paid earned, unused vacation time at separation. Unused sick time is
forfeited.

Generally, you will not be rehired if, when resigning, you fail to give the expected notice or fail to work
out the notice period as agreed upon with your manager. It is the policy of the Company not to rehire a
former employee without prior written approval from the Director of Operations and Human Resources. If
you are terminated for performance reasons or for misconduct, you will not be eligible for rehire.

**JOB ABANDONMENT**

It is the policy of the Company to consider that an employee who abandons his or her job has voluntarily
resigned. If you are absent from work for one day or more without proper notification to the Manager-in-
Charge, you will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. The effective date of terminations will be the
last day in which you were actively at work. If you abandon your job, you will be paid only for each day
actually worked. No earned vacation or sick leave will be paid. The exception regarding vacation pay is
for employees in Louisiana who, in accordance with Louisiana state law, will be paid earned, unused
vacation time at separation. Unused sick leave will not be paid.

**TERMINATION PROCEDURES**

On or before your last day of work, or at any other time when the Company so requests, you must return to
the Company any and all memoranda, notes, manuals, and other documents, including all copies of such
documents, in any way relating to the Company or any of its employees, customers, consultants, or
suppliers. Likewise, you must return to the Company the uniform which was issued to you as well as any
other items issued to you by the Company.

Upon termination of employment, you will receive your final paycheck in accordance with applicable state
law, but no later than the next regularly scheduled payday.
