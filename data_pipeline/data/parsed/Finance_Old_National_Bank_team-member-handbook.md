## Acknowledgment

The information contained in this Team Member Handbook is for your general knowledge and these policies and
practices may be changed by the Company with or without notice at any time. Note, the term "Company" includes all
parents, subsidiaries and other affiliated companies of Old National Bancorp. This handbook supersedes any previous
handbook.

Most of these policies apply to your current employment. However, due to the confidential nature of our business,
some of these policies also apply after you leave the Company. For example, one of the most important policies is to
maintain in strict confidence any information regarding the Company’s customers.

This Team Member Handbook is not an employment contract and is not intended to create contractual obligations of
any kind. Your employment with the Company is on an “at-will” basis. This means that you are free to terminate
employment at any time and the Company equally reserves the right to determine the duration of your service. Only a
Company-approved executive, via a signed, dated, and written document has any authority to enter into any
agreement with you for employment for any specified period of time or to make any agreement with you concerning
ongoing employment with the Company.

The benefit programs described in the handbook are intended to give you a broad overview. This handbook cannot
anticipate every situation or answer every question about your employment. For specific advice, you are to contact HR
Shared Services. Official plan documents provide more detailed information for many of the Company’s benefit
programs such as various insurance and retirement plans.

You are responsible for familiarizing yourself with the content of the Team Member Handbook and for reviewing policy
changes when they are communicated to you.

##### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At Old National, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is an organizational priority, and we imbed DEI into every facet of
our business and culture. We believe DEI enriches the communities in which we live and work, the lives of our team
members, drives our key business objectives and differentiates our performance. We embrace differences based on
ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and national origin, as well as a wide range of unique
characteristics, such as communication and learning styles. Diversity of thought, backgrounds, and experiences in
combination with an environment where differences are celebrated as assets drives innovation and leads to better
outcomes for our business, communities, clients, and team members. We are better able to understand and meet
the changing needs of the communities and clients we serve by reflecting their diverse make-up.

For us, an inclusive culture is a work environment that welcomes and embraces the strengths of our differences,
supports involvement, and provides everyone with equal access to opportunities and information. An inclusive culture
that celebrates all aspects of diversity creates loyalty, a sense of belonging, and a workplace where team members
are valued, respected, and excited to deliver best-in-class service to our clients and communities. Team members
with a variety of talents, viewpoints, and experiences working together enriches our thinking, creates new business
opportunities, and builds long term, highly valued relationships with our clients and communities. When our clients
and communities are successful, Old National shares in that success.

## Your Employment

This handbook provides team members with a general understanding of our Human Resources policies and benefit
programs. Team members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents.

Old National offers its team members competitive compensation, benefits, and other employment related programs.
If team members have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are encouraged to talk to their
supervisors or other appropriate management officials. We believe that Old National demonstrates its commitment
to team members by responding effectively to team member concerns.

##### Rehire Service Date

Effective January 1, 2022, team members of Old National will accrue service years based on the actual number of
years worked regardless of whether their service is part-time or full-time.

Rehired team members of Old National will have their service date adjusted to include past service if they were
employed continuously for at least one year before a break in service and whose break in service does not exceed
their previous time worked. In addition to the Original Hire Date, a separate Adjusted Service Date will be calculated
and recorded in the Human Resources (HR) Information System.

##### Access to Personnel Files

It is the policy of Old National Bank that personnel records and data may be kept only for the purposes necessary for
effective management, compliance with federal regulations or in the best interest of the individual team member.
Personnel files are the property of Old National, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally,
only the management team of Old National, who have a business reason, may review the information in the file.

With reasonable advance notice, team members may review their own personnel files with a Human Resources
Representative present. In some states, there are additional laws about this subject; when applicable, state law takes
precedence over the guidelines above. For more information, contact HR Shared Services.

Inquiries and requests for personal data made by persons outside of the company by letter or in person will not be
honored except as directed by you.

##### Affirmative Action Notice and Notice to Veterans
##### and Individuals with Disabilities

Old National is a federal government contractor subject to Executive Order 11246, as amended by 11375, Section of the Vietnam Era Veteran’s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, and Section 503 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. As such, Old National is committed to taking positive steps to implement the
company’s equal employment opportunity policy. The Company will recruit, hire, train, promote persons, and otherwise
treat qualified minorities, women, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities without regard to race, color,
religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran status, or physical or mental disability. All
employment-related decisions are based on business needs, job requirements, and individual qualifications including
decisions and actions related to compensation, benefits, transfer, layoffs, returns from layoff, company-sponsored
training, education, tuition assistance, and social and recreational programs. Under this policy, Old National will also
provide reasonable accommodation for known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified team member
or applicant for employment, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of the
Company’s business.

**SELF- IDENTIFICATION**

Old National is dedicated to taking affirmative action opportunities to employ and advance in employment veterans
protected by Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteran’s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, and
individuals with a disability covered by Section 403 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. If you are a covered
veteran or an individual with a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act and
believe that you qualify for consideration under any of the Company’s affirmative action programs, you may self-
identify now or at any time in the future by contacting HR Shared Services. Submission of this information is voluntary
and refusal to provide it will not subject you to any adverse treatment. Be assured that your self-identification will be
kept in confidence and the information will only be used in accordance with government regulations. Supervisors and
managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work schedule or duties and necessary accommodations; and
designated Risk Management staff may be informed when, and to the extent appropriate, the condition might require
emergency treatment.

If you wish to be considered for reasonable job-related accommodation, please contact a Talent Management
Representative or your manager. Requests for reasonable accommodation may be presented verbally or in writing.

All team members are expected to comply with our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and Affirmative Action
Program (AAP). Managers who are responsible for meeting business objectives are expected to cooperate fully in
meeting our equal employment opportunity and affirmative action objectives and their overall performance will be
evaluated accordingly.

---

To ensure awareness, understanding, and support meaningful and effective implementation, the subject of equal
employment opportunity and the Company’s commitment under Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive
Order 11375, will continue to have high priority. Executives responsible for the implementation of the Company’s
affirmative action programs will receive annual briefings on Affirmative Action progress. Copies of our affirmative action
programs for protected veterans, individuals with disabilities, and women and minorities are available for review during
normal business hours. If you wish to review the Program or have any other questions or concerns regarding this
policy, please contact HR Shared Services.

##### Business Ethics and Conduct

Old National is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our team members. The Company’s
reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and
regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity.

The continued success of Old National is dependent upon our customers’ trust, and we are dedicated to preserving
that trust. Team members have a duty to Old National Bancorp, its customers, and shareholders to act in a way that
will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public.

Old National expects its directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit,
and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.

In general, the use of good judgment based on high ethical principles will guide you with respect to acceptable
conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter should be
discussed openly with your immediate supervisor and, if necessary, with a Human Resources Representative for
advice and consultation.

Maintaining the highest level of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every Old National team member.
Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment.
#### » **Annually, team members will be required to reaffirm their commitment to these standards**

[**by acknowledging and accepting our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.**](https://www.oldnational.com/docs/default-source/noindex/associate-website/handbook/code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics-2020.pdf?Status=Temp&sfvrsn=3f5ac8fa_2)

Acknowledgment and acceptance of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a condition of continued employment
with Old National Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Individuals who fail to acknowledge and accept the
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will be subject to termination of employment.

##### Compensation Administration

Old National Bancorp recognizes that to attract, motivate and retain a highly skilled workforce, team members must be
compensated in a fair and equitable manner. The Company believes that all jobs are important to the success and
growth of the organization. Therefore, a compensation philosophy has been adopted that ensures all team members a
competitive compensation package based upon the type of work they do and how well they do it.

This philosophy enables Old National to provide its entire workforce, from non-exempt team members to executive
officers, with competitive base pay and opportunities for additional financial rewards based on performance that
meets or exceeds established objectives.

---

##### Job Documentation and Evaluation

Job Documentation and Evaluation is the systematic process for obtaining important and relevant information about
each distinct role in the organization. The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of
every job. These include:

**Essential Duties and Responsibilities**

- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities

- Dimensional Data

- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities

- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities

The goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job
responsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to
identify the appropriate career level for the position.

##### Pay Ranges

Each career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range
minimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and
performance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job’s pay range.

The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the
quality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member’s pay closer
to the midpoint of the job’s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of
the preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career
levels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels.

The maximum of a salary range represents the highest possible value of the job. Team members generally will not
receive increases beyond the maximum of their current job grade. Please contact HR Shared Services for further
information.

##### Conflicts of Interest

Conflicts of interest can harm the Company when someone’s outside interest or relationship interferes, or appears to
interfere, with their ability to make decisions and act in the best interest of Old National. We recognize our team
members have a broad range of personal and community interests and involvement and we strive to find the right
balance between supporting those pursuits and protecting the reputation, brand, and financial success of the
Company. In some cases, the mere potential for conflict or the appearance of a conflict can be a problem, therefore,
team members should avoid situations which affect their ability to be objective and impartial or their loyalties may
become divided. Old National recognizes not all conflicts of interest present a problem, and the Company seeks to
identify and manage all actual and potential conflicts of interest with integrity and transparency.

##### Reasonable Accommodation

Old National values a diverse and inclusive culture and recognizes that differences in a range of unique characteristics
brings richness to our work environment. The Company is committed to complying fully with The Americans with
Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (“ADAAA”) and all applicable state
and local fair employment practices laws. Generally, discrimination against persons with a known association or
relationship with a disabled individual is prohibited. Old National provides reasonable accommodations in order for the
individual to perform the essential functions of the job in question. Old National does not retaliate against individuals
because they request a reasonable accommodation.

While many individuals with disabilities can work without accommodation, some individuals may face barriers to
employment in the absence of an accommodation process. If Old National is notified that a qualified individual with
a disability requires a reasonable accommodation in order to apply for a position, perform the essential functions
of a job, or enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, the Company will work with the individual to find a
reasonable accommodation unless doing so would impose a direct threat to the team member, applicant, or others
and without imposing an undue hardship on Old National’s business.

Initial requests for reasonable accommodation may be presented verbally or in writing to a Human Resources
Representative or your supervisor. An individual seeking an accommodation will engage in an interactive dialog,
“the interactive process” with their supervisor and/or a Human Resources Representative. Old National’s Human
Resources Department is responsible for determining if the individual is considered “qualified” and if a “reasonable
accommodation” exists. The reasonable accommodation is not required to be the specific accommodation requested
by the individual. There may be more than one way to reasonably accommodate the individual. It is also possible that
the only reasonable accommodation is a leave of absence. Old National is not required to change the essential
functions of the job as a reasonable accommodation. Assistance will be made available to any individual requiring
help in identifying an appropriate accommodation. Supporting documentation of the disability and/or accommodation
may be requested.
[#### »](https://www.oldnational.com/docs/default-source/noindex/associate-website/handbook/accommodation-request-form.pdf?sfvrsn=2ec82e7f_2)[**Use the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form if you wish to request an accommodation in writing.**](https://www.oldnational.com/docs/default-source/noindex/associate-website/handbook/accommodation-request-form.pdf?sfvrsn=2ec82e7f_2)

##### Equal Employment Opportunity

In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at
Old National will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. Old National does not discriminate in employment
opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin,
age, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations.
Each year the Company and its subsidiaries affirm their continued commitment to Equal Employment Opportunities for
all qualified individuals.

In addition to a commitment to provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified individuals, Old National has
established Affirmative Action Programs throughout the Company to promote opportunities for individuals in certain
protected classes. Please contact HR Shared Services if you have questions or need further information about these
programs.

Any team members with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to
bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Team members
can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Anyone engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination
will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

---

##### Working Relationships Policy

Team members are encouraged to socialize and develop professional relationships in the workplace. However, these
relationships should not interfere with an individual's performance or the effective functioning of the workplace. Team
members should be mindful that workplace relationships may create actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of interest.
Team members in a supervisory role or a senior position outside the immediate management structure must avoid
favoritism, bias, or conflicts of interests when handling employment or financial matters.

Questions or concerns about favoritism, bias, conflicts of interest, or any other issue arising from workplace
relationships should be discussed with your manager or a Talent Manager/Talent Partner. Workplace relationships
may include family, romantic or other close personal relationships. Any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of
interest or any possible or actual misuse of power/authority should be disclosed to the team member's manager, next
higher level of manager, their Talent Manager/Talent Partner or contact EthicsPoint from the Intranet homepage.

##### Job Posting

Old National provides team members the opportunity to apply for open positions and advance within the organization
according to their skills and experience. Job posting is a way to inform team members of openings and to identify
qualified and interested applicants who might not otherwise be known to the hiring manager. Other recruiting sources
may also be used to fill open positions. There are situations where management may choose not to post a job such as
openings resulting from restructuring, reorganization or staff reductions or an opportunity to promote a current team
member.

Most job openings will be posted on the Company’s Intranet site. Eligible team members should only apply for those
posted jobs for which they possess the required skills, competencies, and qualifications. Team members may apply for
a posted position upon completion of at least 6 months of continuous service in his/her present position and must have
consistently met performance expectations in the current job. Exceptions may be made by the Director of Talent
Acquisition, SVP, or by a member of the Executive Leadership Team.

##### How to Apply

From inside the Old National network, you can complete the process through the intranet. You’ll find the site listed
as “Job Opportunities” under Quick Links on the Intranet Homepage or the Human Resources drop down menu.

You can also submit your application from home by visiting oldnational.jobs. The applications of all ONB team members
who apply for a posting will be reviewed, so it is extremely important that you check the
box next to “I am a current employee” when asked how you learned of the job posting. Otherwise, we may not
recognize you as a current team member and give you the consideration you deserve.

We encourage team members to talk with their supervisor about their career plans. Supervisors are encouraged
to support team members’ efforts to gain experience and advance within the organization. Team members are
required to notify their immediate supervisor prior to participating in an interview with an internal hiring supervisor.
An applicant’s supervisor may be contacted to verify the applicant’s performance, skills, and attendance.

---

##### Referring External Applicants

Old National recognizes that employee referrals are a valuable source for recruiting new talent to our company. Team
members can email a current job opportunity to a friend by selecting a current opening on our career site and clicking
the Email this job to a friend button. Team members will need to enter the candidate’s first name, last name, and email
address. The referred candidate must formally apply by completing the link/online application. The referred candidate
must list the name of the employee that referred them in the “How did you hear about us” field for tracking purposes.

**EMPLOYEE REFERRAL PROGRAM POLICY GUIDELINES:**

- Due to the volume of resumes that are received, only qualified candidates selected for interviews will be contacted.

- Team members are strongly encouraged to ensure that all referred candidates meet the posted job qualifications.Only those candidates who meet the requirements will be considered for further review.

- Old National will continue to emphasize our diversity efforts. Old National is an Affirmative Action/EqualOpportunity Employer.

- The referred candidate must pass all appropriate testing and interviews, be selected as the most qualifiedfor the positions, and successfully onboard with Old National.

- The referring team member will be awarded a $600 referral bonus on the first paycheck administratively possiblefollowing successful completion of the new team member’s 90-day orientation period.

##### Life-Threatening Illness in the Workplace

Team members with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) and its related conditions such as AIDS-related complex (ARC) often wish to continue their normal pursuits,
including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. Old National supports these efforts as long as team members
are able to meet acceptable performance standards. As in the case of other disabilities, Old National will provide
reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal requirements, to allow qualified team members with life-
threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs.

Medical information concerning individual team members is treated confidentially. Old National will take reasonable
precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other team members have a
responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of team members' medical information. Anyone inappropriately
disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

***Team members with questions or concerns about life-threatening illnesses are encouraged to contact***
***HR Shared Services or Old National’s Employee Assistance Program for information or advice.***

---

##### Meal Periods

All full-time team members are provided with one meal period each workday. Supervisors will schedule meal periods
to accommodate business needs. Team members will be relieved of all active responsibilities and restrictions during
meal periods and will not be compensated for that time. If for any reason, on occasion, you are required to work or stay
at your workstation during your meal period, it is considered paid time and non-exempt team members should record
this as work time. Some states have specific regulations requiring meal and/or break periods for all team members.
Refer to Important Employee Legal Rights Notices on the intranet for more information or contact HR Shared Services
for information about your state.

All breaks should be scheduled around the departmental workload to ensure optimum customer service. When the
workload is such that breaks are not given, the time normally given does not accumulate and cannot be taken later.
Old National will comply with any state law that provides for break time and/or meal periods.

##### Outside Employment and Business Interests

Old National recognizes that some team members may wish to pursue external employment or business opportunities
during their personal time. Team members may hold a job with another organization or pursue an external business
interest if they satisfactorily perform their job responsibilities with Old National and the external employment or
business interest does not compete with Old National’s business or create a conflict of interest. All team members
will be judged by the same performance expectations and will be expected to satisfy Old National work schedules
regardless of any existing outside work requirements. Team members must have their supervisor’s approval before
accepting outside employment.

If Old National determines that a team member’s outside work or business interest interferes with their performance or
Company requirements, the team member may be asked to terminate the outside employment or business interest if
they wish to remain with Old National.

##### Talent Management - Development, Career and Performance

Old National is committed to the growth and success of every team member throughout their career with the company.
Old National’s talent management process fosters a culture of excellence. Old National believes that excellence is
more than just doing well or meeting expectations—it’s about developing skills and knowledge, becoming a better
contributor, and giving it your all every day. The talent management process involves an active partnership between
team members, managers, and Old National.

**The core elements of the process include:**

- Setting clear goals and expectations.

- Actively engaging in ongoing coaching and two-way dialogue and feedback.

- Growth through development and career planning.

- Motivating excellence through engagement and recognition.

**ONE- ON- ONE SESSIONS**

Formal and informal one-on-one sessions provide a forum for a manager and team member to discuss expectations,
development, and performance. These sessions are intended to promote open two-way dialogue between managers
and team members. A written evaluation is not a part of these discussions, but both parties are encouraged to take
notes to reflect critical information such as expectations, action items and commitments, progress on goals, and next
steps for future discussions.

---

**Generally, the objectives of the one-on-one sessions are to:**

- Update your manager on results.

- Receive ongoing feedback and coaching on performance.

- Recognize recent accomplishments.

- Encourage and foster accountability.

Managers and team members will set a regular cadence for one-on-one discussions. One-on-one sessions will be
scheduled by the manager based on the needs of the team. Regular one-on-one sessions should be scheduled at
least once per month. Performance and development focused one on one sessions should be scheduled at least
quarterly.

Goals and expectations are generally clarified during the first quarter of each year and revisited during quarterly
one-on-one sessions throughout the year based on the changing needs of the department and business.

Career development discussions are driven by the team member and may be scheduled at any time. Team
members complete and Individual Development Plan (IDP) to document their development goals. Discussions can be
included in regularly scheduled one-on-one sessions or scheduled separately.

**What can team members expect:**

- Formal and informal one-on-one sessions with your manager at least monthly.

- Clear communication of performance expectations and goals.

- Open honest feedback about your performance and development on an ongoing basis.

- Coaching to develop competencies, enhance performance, and grow your career.

- Ownership in planning your development with support from your manager and the company.

- Access to the tools, resources, and job-related training needed to perform your job.

- Access to development programs and career development tools and resources.

- Recognition and rewards for successful performance.

**Critical talent management behaviors for each team member include:**

- Setting goals for development and creating an action plan to achieve those objectives.

- Giving, receiving, and asking for feedback.

- Asking clarifying questions.

- Implementing the feedback that’s been shared.

**Critical talent management behaviors for each manager include:**

- Setting, communicating, and discussing expectations.

- Coaching and feedback centered on continual improvement and competency building.

- Asking questions to learn more, enhance understanding, and create self-awareness.

- Actively listening.

- Providing, receiving, and asking for feedback.

- Holding oneself and others accountable

##### Transfers and Relocation Assistance

Relocation benefits may be available for company-initiated transfers or newly hired team members, who must relocate
in order to reside 50 miles or less from his/her regularly assigned location. Eligibility requirements for relocation
benefits are defined in a separate Relocation Policy.

Old National extends these relocation benefits in an effort to contribute to the success of every team member’s
relocation. However, in the event the team member leaves Old National prior to the Note Termination Date, the
amount of the relocation reimbursement will be considered a loan. Accordingly, the team member will be required to
reimburse Old National. The Note Termination Date shall be the date which is twelve months after the date on which
the team member has completed the move to the new location. Completion of the relocation will be the date when the
final expense for the relocation has been paid.

##### Volunteer Time

Old National is proud to contribute to the strength and vitality of our communities through the One Community
Volunteer Program. One Community is a program designed to formally recognize and track your volunteer involvement
in all our communities. All team members are invited to be a part of One Community and to be recognized for the good
work done. The One Community program provides up to 24 hours of *paid time per year with supervisory approval for
volunteer activities with a non-profit organization during your normal work hours.

**Scheduling.** Supervisors and team members are encouraged to work together on a schedule that allows business
needs to be met and provides the team members with the opportunity to serve in the community.

**Time Reporting.** Non-exempt team members should record their volunteer time in Time & Labor using the VLT code.

**Related Expenses.** Expenses such as transportation, meals, etc. incurred during volunteer time will be at your
expense. Please refer to the corporate expense policy for information on mileage reimbursement.

**New Hires.** Newly hired team members are encouraged to discuss an appropriate schedule with their supervisor
as it may not be practical for them to take all 24 hours in the first calendar year depending on when they are hired.

**Volunteer time is intended to provide pay during regularly scheduled work hours and should not be used to provide*
*hours beyond the team members budgeted weekly hours. Volunteer time does not carry forward and any unused*
*volunteer time will not be paid at termination.*

Subject to state workers’ compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the
payment of workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member’s voluntary participation in
any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during
normal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program.

##### Work Schedules

Work schedules for team members vary throughout our organization. Staffing needs and operational demands may
necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each
day and week.

Old National may need to occasionally increase or decrease work schedules or hours for business reasons and team
members will be asked to comply with such changes. However, these team members will be given as much advance
notice as possible.

---

##### Alternative Work Schedules

It’s not always easy to create a fit between work schedules with the other responsibilities in our lives. Old National is a
Work/Life company, and that means that we are committed to, whenever possible, working with our team members to
achieve a fit that ensures that both work duties and other responsibilities are fulfilled.

Alternative Work Schedules are a part of this commitment. Although not every position may be conducive to alternative
work arrangements, managers will review each situation individually to meet team member needs while maintaining
adequate staffing levels and providing superior customer service. Alternative work arrangements include, but are not
limited to, compressed work weeks, part-time hours, job sharing, reduced and/or flex hours. While these options are
not an entitlement, when managers and team members work together, they can turn a challenge into a true win-win
situation.

If you encounter a situation that leads you to believe that an Alternative Work Schedule would meet your needs, you
should carefully consider how it will impact your department and be prepared with possible solutions when you meet
with your manager to request the Alternative Work Schedule.

More information regarding Alternative Work Schedules, including the request form can be found in MyHR.

##### Employment Categories

Employment categories are established so that team members will understand their employment status and benefit
eligibility.

Each team member is assigned to either a Non-Exempt or Exempt category according to Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) requirements. Non-Exempt team members are entitled to overtime pay. Exempt team members are excluded
from state and/or federal overtime regulations. A team member’s Exempt or Non-Exempt classification may be
changed to comply with the appropriate regulations.

**In addition to the above categories, each team member will be assigned to one of the following classifications:**

**FULL- TIME**

Those team members who are not in a temporary status and who are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours
per week. They are eligible for Old National Bancorp’s benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and
limitations of each benefit plan.

**PART- TIME**

Those team members who are regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours per week. Part-time level I team
member is defined as a team member who is regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours every week. A part-time
level II team member is defined as a team member who is scheduled to work less than 20 hours every week.

**TEMPORARY**

##### Polygraph Tests

Old National complies with The Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988. The Federal Employee Polygraph
Protection Act prohibits most private sector employers from requiring or requesting team members or job applicants
to take any lie detector tests or from using the results of such a test, even if an outside agency screens team members
or applicants. Further, team members and applicants can’t be discriminated against based on polygraph test results or
for refusing to take the test. Employers must also inform team members and applicants in writing of their rights under
this law.

##### Confidential Information

of Old National. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to:

records should be kept in a secure area at all times. Team members who have access to confidential information may
be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment. Team members who improperly use or
disclose trade secrets or confidential business information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information.

##### Personal Data Changes

It is the responsibility of each team member to promptly notify Old National of any changes in personal data. Personal
mailing address, telephone numbers, marital status, beneficiary designations, individuals to be contacted in the event
of an emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all
times.

## Benefit Programs

##### Insurance Continuation (COBRA)

The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives team members and their qualified
beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under various Old National plans when a
“qualifying event” would normally result in the loss of eligibility.

**Some common qualifying events include:**

- Termination of employment

- Death of a team member

- Reduction in a team member’s hours

- Leave of absence

- Divorce or legal separation

- A dependent child no longer meetingeligibility requirements.

The team member must notify the Plan Administrator of a divorce, legal separation, termination of domestic partner
relationship, or a dependent child becoming ineligible within 30 days after the event occurs, otherwise continuation
rights will be lost. If you wish to extend coverage because of disability, you must notify the Plan Administrator of the
disability before the 18-month continuation coverage period ends, otherwise extension rights will be lost.

Under COBRA, the team member or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at Old National’s group rates plus an
administration fee. Each eligible team member will receive a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA
when the team member becomes eligible for coverage under various Old National plans. The notice contains important
information about the team member’s rights and obligations and generally will be mailed within two weeks from the
date coverage ceases.

election period, COBRA beneficiaries who do not return an election form to Wex will receive a COBRA Expiration

**FACILITIES**

Where reasonably possible, Mother’s Rooms are available for breastfeeding team members at Old National work sites
and cold storage for the milk will be provided or accommodated. ONB’s goal is to provide our team members with a

mothers to coordinate appropriate arrangements specific to their work location. Please contact HR Shared Services if
you need assistance coordinating a space in your location.

**BREAK PERIODS**

Nursing mothers are allowed by law reasonable break times to express milk for her nursing child after the child’s birth.
Break times must, if possible, run concurrently with any break times already provided. Generally, a maximum of 15 to
25 minutes three times a day should be sufficient for the team member. The team member should be able to
reasonably determine what time she expects to need her break and the length of time it will take. However, additional
flexibility may be needed in the early weeks following her return to work as a schedule is established.
Supervisors are encouraged to work with nursing mothers to determine how best to accommodate the needs of the
mother while still accomplishing the performance of her job. Break periods to express milk are paid.

## Taking Time Off

Taking time away from work, whether for relaxation, for when you are ill, or for other personal reasons, is important
to stay happy and healthy. Old National provides a variety of paid time off and leave benefits to meet team members’
needs. This section explains the opportunities available to Old National team members.

##### Paid Time Off

Old National offers team members access to a Paid Time Off (PTO) bank of time that provides flexibility to manage
paid time away from work based on individualized needs and circumstances. Team members may use their PTO for
any reason including vacations, illnesses, appointments, or other personal reasons. Any non-emergency absences
and pre-planned usage of PTO must be approved in advance by your supervisor. Your supervisor will evaluate your
PTO requests and determine whether to approve or deny it based on several factors, including business needs and
staffing requirements.

At Old National, we support you in making the health of you and your loved ones a priority by providing you up to hours of paid time off per calendar year to use for medical appointments for yourself or an immediate family member
(spouse/partner, child, parent, or another for whom you have legal guardianship). Paid time off provided for
appointments may be used for medical, dental, vision, or other related appointments.

**PAID TIME FOR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS IS:**

PTO is available to all team members based on the schedule below. PTO pay benefits will be calculated based on the
team member’s base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation such as
overtime, incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials.

Commissioned team members who receive base plus commission pay are eligible for PTO based on the above
schedule. Fully commissioned team members are not eligible for paid PTO time.

Team members moving from part-time to full-time status during the year will receive an additional pro-rated amount of
PTO for the remainder of the calendar year that considers their years of service, timing of their move, and the annual
amount of time provided under the PTO schedule. Full-time team members moving to part-time status during the year
will not have their PTO time adjusted.

**PTO USAGE**

PTO benefits are made available at the beginning of the calendar year for full-time and part-time level I team members
and quarterly for part-time level II team members. Commissioned team members are permitted time away consistent
with Old National’s PTO schedule.

All full-time team members use eight hours of PTO for a full day off and four hours for a half day off. All part-time team
members use PTO based on the number of hours they are normally scheduled to work. PTO must be used in minimum
increments of a quarter hour. Non-exempt and exempt team members’ PTO balances and time off requests are
tracked in Old National’s timekeeping system in order to comply with state and local laws.

Team members who are eligible for 80 or more hours of PTO will be required to take 40 hours (5 business days) of
consecutive time off for internal control purposes unless there are extenuating circumstances.
All available PTO must be used prior to being unpaid.

**PTO CARRYOVER**

Team members that do not use all their available PTO may carry over up to 80 hours into the next calendar year. A
team member’s carryover PTO balance should be exhausted first before they begin using PTO from the current year.

** Old National complies with state laws if state regulations differ from our normal policy.*

**PTO AT TERMINATION**

Old National does not pay out unused PTO for the current plan year upon employment separation, except for
retirements (at least age 55 with 5 years of continuous service prior to separation), job eliminations or employment
separations where payment is required by state law. For those three noted exceptions, PTO paid at your separation
from employment will be calculated based on the number of calendar months you have worked in the current plan year
reduced by the PTO hours you have taken during the year. All accrued but unused PTO time for the current pay year
will be paid to those in the noted group exceptions at the rate of pay applicable at the time
of termination of employment. Team members accrue 1/12 of their annual PTO allotment for any month in which
they work.

Any remaining PTO carryover from the prior calendar year will be paid out in full upon separation of employment
and will be paid at the rate of pay applicable at the time of termination of employment.

***Contact HR Shared Services if you have questions regarding PTO.***

##### Bereavement Leave

At Old National, we recognize that team members may require time away from work following the death of a family
member. During these difficult times, team members should talk with their manager about their situation to help
determine the appropriate time off needed based on the bereavement guidelines below.

**BEREAVEMENT**

Relationship Time Off Provided

Spouse/Partner Up to 5 days

Child (All) Up to 10 days

Parent (including in-laws) Up to 5 days

Sibling Up to 5 days

Grandparents Up to 5 days

Grandchildren Up to 5 days

All Other Relatives Up to 2 days

Team Member Up to 4 hours

Bereavement should typically be used consecutively and will normally be granted, unless there are unusual business
needs or staffing requirements.

***Some state laws may allow additional unpaid bereavement leave. For more information, contact UNUM at 866-***
***679-3054 or online at unum.com/claims.***

##### Holidays

Old National observes the Federal Reserve Holiday schedule.

Additionally, Old National provides a half-day (4 hours) holiday on Christmas Eve when it occurs during the regular
workweek.

Any hourly team member required to work on a full-day holiday will receive holiday pay plus 1 1/2 times their rate of
pay for hours worked. Hourly team members are paid their regular hourly rate for time worked on Christmas Eve.

Old National grants 8 hours of holiday pay to all full-time team members and 4 hours to all part-time team members
for each holiday.

If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member’s paid absence or leave, holiday pay will be paid instead
of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have applied.

Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for overtime purposes. Holiday pay is not earned in
advance and unused holiday pay will not be paid out at termination.

##### Jury Duty

Old National encourages team members to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required. If you
are called for jury duty and you are a full-time or part-time level I team member, you will receive your regular pay for
your regularly scheduled hours of work plus jury pay provided by the court.

Team members must provide the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so the supervisor can
plan for their absence. Team members are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits.

Either Old National or the team member may request an excuse from jury duty if, in Old National’s judgment, the team
member’s absence would create serious operational difficulties. Old National will continue to provide and accrue all
eligible benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence.

##### Witness Duty

Old National encourages team members to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so.

Team members should provide the subpoena to their supervisor as soon as possible so the supervisor can plan for
their absence. Team members are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits.

If a team member is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by Old National, they will receive paid
time for the entire period of witness duty. If a team member is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as
witnesses by a party other than Old National, they should use Paid Time Off (PTO).

##### Time Off to Vote

Time Off to Vote Old National encourages team members to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in
elections. Generally, team members find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If team
members are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, Old National provides all team members up
to two hours of paid time to vote. In state or areas with laws which require employers to provide more than two hours
for voting, we comply with those local or state laws and requirements

## Leave Policies

##### Family and Medical Leave Act

Old National complies with all applicable federal and state labor and employment laws, including the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The FMLA requires employers to provide a minimum period of unpaid leave for specific
family or medical events.

An eligible team member may take FMLA leave of up to 12 weeks per leave year for any of the first four reasons listed
below, and up to 26 weeks per leave year for the fifth reason. Any leave taken by an eligible team member for one or
more of these reasons will be counted against that team member’s FMLA entitlement.

- To care for a newborn child, or a child newly placed in the team member’s custody through adoption or foster care,for a period of up to one year after such birth or placement.

- To care for the team member’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition

---

- Old National prohibits team members from engaging in outside employment while on FMLA leave.#### » **For more information regarding FMLA eligibility or to request a leave of absence, contact UNUM at**

[**866-679-3054 or online at unum.com/claims.**](http://www.unum.com/claims)

##### Leave Administration

Old National recognizes that team members need to be away from work on occasion to attend to serious health
issues, significant life events, and personal or family needs. We are pleased to assist team members with access to
paid leave to attend to these important matters. To be eligible for paid leave, a team member must be either full-time or
part-time level I and have a qualifying, approved, continuous leave that begins on or after six months of continuous
service for leaves due to a team member’s own serious health condition and on or after one year of continuous service
for Caregiver and Parental Leaves. Leaves taken under Old National’s paid leave policies will also be credited against
any applicable FMLA and state law requirements. If a team member fails to return to work on the designated leave
return date, Old National will assume the team member has resigned, unless the team member previously requested
and received approval from HR Shared Services for a leave extension.

##### Leaves of Absence and Pay Policies

**MEDICAL LEAVE/ SHORT- TERM DISABILITY**

Old National provides paid leaves to eligible team members who must be off work continuously for more than three
days due to their own serious health condition or disability. For purposes of this policy, serious health conditions or
disabilities include in-patient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, continuing treatment by a
health care provider, and temporary disabilities associated with a medical condition. This paid leave may also qualify
for FMLA and/or state law protection. Consecutive leave periods separated by 14 days or less for the same medical
condition are considered one period of disability.

Team members are expected to work if they are physically able to perform the job and return to work as soon as
released by their medical provider. A medical release must be submitted to UNUM upon the team member’s return to
work.

**PLAN DESIGN** **MEDICAL LEAVE/SHORT-TERM DISABILITY**

**CAREGIVER LEAVE**

Old National provides paid caregiver leaves to eligible team members who take time off from work duties continuously
to care for a spouse, domestic partner, child or parent with a serious health condition or disability for more than three
days. For purposes of this policy, serious health conditions or disabilities include in-patient care in a hospital, hospice
or residential medical care facility, and continuing treatment by a health care provider. Paid caregiver leaves may also
qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection.

**Maximum Duration**
**of Leave**
Up to 12 weeks for full-time and part-time level I in a rolling 12-month calendar year.

**PARENTAL LEAVE**

Team members may qualify for up to six continuous weeks of paid bonding time following the birth, adoption, or foster
placement of a child under the age of 18 (“Parental Event”). To qualify for Parental Leave, a team member must be
either Full-Time or Part-Time Level I, have one or more year of service at the time of the Parental Event, and use one
week of PTO for the first week of paid leave associated with the Parental Event.

A paid leave for a birthing parent begins with Short-Term Disability (i.e. Medical), which typically lasts for six weeks
followed by up to an additional six weeks of bonding time. When eligible for a parental leave as a birth parent, the Short-
Term Disability (Medical) and bonding time are treated as one continuous leave for pay purposes, and leave benefits are
paid according to the Short-Term Disability chart in the table above. Non-birthing parents must also use one week of
PTO as the first week of their leave and will receive up to an additional five paid weeks to also provide up to six weeks of
paid bonding time in total with leave benefits paid according to the Caregiver Leave chart in the table above.

Birthing team members that do not meet the eligibility requirements for parental leave, may be eligible for medical/short-
term disability leave at the time of birth until medically released by their healthcare provider.

***Paid parental leave may also qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection.***

**COMMISSION BASED TEAM MEMBERS**

Leave pay for team members paid on a commission basis will be based on a team member’s basic monthly earnings.
Commissions shall be averaged for the 24 months that are prior to the date the leave began. If employed less than months, the commissions shall be averaged for the total number of months employed. Any commission payments that
continue after the leave begins cannot be considered as part of the basic monthly earnings. Commissions do not
include arbitrary commissions not directly related to the team member’s production. Team members will be eligible to
receive any net commissions earned during the period of disability in excess of the basic monthly earnings. See the
schedule below:

**COMMISSION TYPE** **BASIC MONTHLY EARNINGS INCLUDES:**

**Base Plus Commission**

Monthly rate of base pay plus the average of 24 months of commission payments

**Straight Commission**
Average of 24 months of commission payment, draw payments are withheld during
the leave period

**INTERMITTENT LEAVE**

Team members taking leave intermittently must promptly contact UNUM, our leave administrator, when they miss work
due to their approved leave. Although a team member is never required to “make-up” time missed due to a leave, the
team member may choose to do so with prior supervisor approval. Any “make-up” time must occur during the same
work week as the original time missed and does not need to be reported to Unum.

Team members with approved intermittent absences will be paid using their paid time off (PTO). All available PTO
must be used prior to being unpaid. Exempt team members that exhaust their PTO should open a case in MyHR so
their payroll can be adjusted accordingly.

##### Long-Term Disability

Old National provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits to eligible full-time team members who are unable to work
because of a long-term qualifying medical disability. If a disability lasts longer than 26 weeks, Short-Term Disability
benefits stop and Long-Term Disability benefits for eligible team members may begin. Long-Term Disability benefits
are designed to continue monthly income equal to 60% of pay up to a maximum of $15,000 per month. The Long-
Term Disability insurance carrier will determine eligibility.
[#### »](https://handbook.oldnational.com/longterm-disability)[Click here for details of the LTD benefit plan, including benefit amounts, limitations, and restrictions.](https://handbook.oldnational.com/longterm-disability)

##### Military Leave (Self, Exigency & Caregiver)

**MILITARY LEAVE FOR SELF**

A military leave of absence will be granted to team members who are absent from work because of service in the
U.S. uniformed services in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act
(USERRA). Advance notice of military service is required, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it is
otherwise impossible or unreasonable.

If a team member is called to service in the military, or must attend military training, and he/she earns less in the
military, Old National will pay the difference between their regular salary and the amount paid by the government for
up to 18 months. Although we are not required by law to pay this difference, we are proud to do so as a way of
showing our support for our team members who serve our country in the uniformed services. If a team member has
unused Paid Time Off (PTO) when the leave begins, and the team member will not return from leave prior to the new
calendar year, the team member has the option to be paid for any unused PTO when the leave begins or at the end
of the year. The team member
can choose to roll over up to 80 hours of PTO. Upon the team member’s return to work after deployment, PTO will
be granted based on the team member’s years of service.

| COMMISSION TYPE | BASIC MONTHLY EARNINGS INCLUDES: |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| | |
| Base Plus Commission | Monthly rate of base pay plus the average of 24 months of commission payments |
| Straight Commission | Average of 24 months of commission payment, draw payments are withheld during
the leave period |

---

**MILITARY EXIGENCY LEAVE**

Old National provides paid military exigency leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team
member whose spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty, or are called to covered active-duty status,
to take leave to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short
notice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities. Paid military exigency leave may also
qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection. Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for
pay purposes.

**MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE**

Old National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team
member to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (“nearest blood
relative”) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state
law protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave
plan design for pay purposes.

##### Personal Leave

Old National provides leaves of absence without pay to eligible team members who wish to take time off from work
duties to fulfill obligations other than qualifying FMLA events such as, visiting family in a foreign country, or a mission
trip. Additionally, team members that do not meet the service requirements for paid leave for their own medical
condition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave. All team members are eligible to request
personal leave.

One personal leave may be granted for a period of up to 30 consecutive calendar days every two years per supervisor
approval. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single
extension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be
evaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the
proposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)
before going into an unpaid status.

When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it
is available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot
guarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection.

##### Worker’s Compensation Insurance

Old National provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This
program covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,
surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers’ compensation insurance
provides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses.

---

Subject to state workers’ compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the
payment of workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member’s voluntary participation in
any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during
normal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program.

## Your Pay

Understanding the components of your pay is important to you. In this section, the details of how time is tracked,
as well as information on deductions and overtime is discussed.

##### Deductions

The law requires that Old National make certain deductions from every team member’s compensation. Among these
are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Old National must also deduct Social Security taxes on each
team member’s earnings up to the Social Security “wage base.” Old National matches the amount of Social Security
taxes paid by each team member.

Old National offers additional programs and benefits. Team members authorize deductions from their pay checks
to cover the costs of participation in these programs. Forms to change certain deductions are available on the
Company’s Intranet by navigating to HR & L&D > Forms.

Sometimes involuntary deductions are taken by Old National, usually to pay off a debt or obligation, when required by
federal or state agencies. Team members are encouraged to maintain a satisfactory credit record to ensure that these
deductions are not required. Confidential credit counseling services are available through Old National’s Employee
Assistance Program and may be available through other Credit Counseling Agencies located in your local community.

If you have questions concerning deductions made from your paycheck or how they were calculated, contact HR
Shared Services.

##### Overdrafts

As a team member of Old National, you are encouraged to maintain your banking relationship with us. Our expectation
is that you will maintain your account in good status. Therefore, we encourage you to consider Overdraft Protection for
your checking account(s) to cover inadvertent overdrafts.

To sign up for Overdraft Protection, please contact Client Care or visit your local banking center. If you choose not to
enroll in Overdraft Protection, overdraft decisions will be made according to Overdraft Courtesy guidelines. Team
members with accounts that are overdrawn or with overdrafts that exceed Overdraft Protection coverage will be
reviewed as part of the Company’s overall internal control procedures.

Certain government regulations place overdraft restrictions on certain executive officers. These restrictions include the
amount an account can be overdrawn, the length of time an account can be overdrawn and prohibits the waiving of
overdraft fees. The restrictions identified within the regulations supersede any internal policy regarding overdrafts for
those individuals governed by this regulation.

[**Employee Assistance Program.**](https://www.oldnational.com/associate-website/onb-well/employee-assistance-program)

---

##### Overtime

Occasionally you may be asked to work overtime when business needs cannot be met during regular working hours.
When possible, advance notification of these mandatory assignments will be provided. Overtime must always be
approved in advance by the team member’s supervisor. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as
practical to all team members qualified to perform the required work.

Overtime will be paid to non-exempt team members who work more than 40 hours during a week, which is defined as
Sunday through Saturday, at the rate of one and one-half times the team member’s regular base rate. Overtime
compensation is paid to all non-exempt team members in accordance with federal and state, wage, and hour
restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time off for holidays, PTO, or any leave of absence will
not be considered hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations.

Overtime must always be approved in advance by the team member’s supervisor. However, if a non-exempt team
member does not obtain pre-approval, the time must still be treated as work time. If a team member continues to work
overtime without proper approval or fails to work requested overtime, it may result in disciplinary action.

Holiday premium pay is applicable to full and part time non-exempt team members. You will be paid one and one-half
times your regular hourly rate for all hours worked on holidays observed by your office, in addition to receiving your
regular holiday pay. If you work on a holiday, input the hours worked into Old National’s timekeeping system as normal
in/out entries.

##### Pay Corrections

Old National takes all reasonable steps to ensure that team members receive the correct amount of pay in each
paycheck and that team members are paid promptly on the scheduled payday.

If there is an error in the amount of pay, the team member should promptly notify HR Shared Services so that the
discrepancy can be reviewed. If the Company identifies the error, the team member will be contacted immediately,
and the appropriate adjustment will be made as quickly as possible. Payroll corrections will normally be made with
the next scheduled paycheck date immediately following the error.

If a team member’s paycheck has been lost in the mail and it has been more than five business days, please contact
HR Shared Services for instructions.

##### Paydays

All team members are paid bi-weekly with each payroll period ending at the end of the team member’s normal shift on
Saturday. For hourly team members, each pay advice will include earnings for all work performed through the end of
the previous payroll week. For salaried team members, each pay advice includes earnings for all work performed
through the end of the week for the current payroll period. The normal payday for all team members is Friday. The
Company allows two options for team members to receive their bi-weekly pay. *Team members may either elect direct
deposit into an Old National account or choose to be paid by check. ( **Excluding the Minnesota Region* ).

All Old National team members are eligible for three FREE personal checking accounts. This benefit applies to
traditional personal checking accounts only, and the team member must be a single or joint owner of the account.

---

##### Severance Pay

Old National provides severance pay to eligible team members whose employment is terminated because of a job
elimination. The purpose of severance pay is to minimize the financial hardship that might occur when team members
experience job loss through no fault of their own. Severance benefits and the eligibility requirements are detailed in the
[**Severance Pay Summary Plan Description**](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)[.](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)

##### Timekeeping

It is the responsibility of every non-exempt team member to accurately record time worked. Federal and state laws
require Old National to keep an accurate record of time worked to calculate team member pay and benefits. Time
worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties.

Non-exempt team members should accurately record their time worked daily. Non-exempt team members must
accurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal
period. They should also record the hours of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. Salaried non-
exempt team members must accurately record any deviations to their standard schedule.

Misrepresenting or falsifying timekeeping or recording time for another team member may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment.

It is the team member’s responsibility to enter their time to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The supervisor will
review and approve the time record before submitting it for payroll processing.

A team member’s workday, in general, begins when the team member commences their job duties and ends when they
have ceased performing job duties. Team members performing opening and closing procedures are considered
“working” when these procedures begin even if part of those procedures are in the parking lot. Team members
participating in these procedures would be able to use the mobile app to clock in or out from the parking lot to capture
their accurate time worked. Those team members that are not part of opening and closing procedures may use the
mobile app to clock in when at their workstation ready to begin work or clock out when at their workstation done with
their work.

Instructions and policies related to timekeeping can be found in MyHR.

***Note: Intranet sites are only accessible from within the Old National Network.***

##### Travel Time

Ordinary travel from home to work is not counted as hours worked. Non-exempt team members required to travel out
of town for business-related matters will be paid for all hours worked. Additionally, hours worked include time spent
traveling to or home from the out-of-town business location (e.g., in a car, in an airplane). Other time spent out of town
for business travel, such as time in hotel for overnight stays and meals, are not considered hours worked.

##### Advances

Old National does not provide pay advances on earned or unearned wages to team members, prior to the team
member’s scheduled payment date, unless otherwise stated in an existing employment agreement.

---

##### Pay Transparency

Old National will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against team members or applicants because they
have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another team member or applicant. However,
team members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of
their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not
otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or
charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by
the employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor’s legal duty to furnish information.

## Your Conduct

To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members
to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this
section of the Team Member Handbook, you’ll learn what’s expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the
job as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace.

##### Absenteeism

As part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality.
The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you’re
not working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients.

**PLANNED ABSENCES**

You must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the
established guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or
banking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads.

**UNPLANNED ABSENCES**

Unscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from
your manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to
suffer. If you’re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your
normal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center.

**EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM**

Old National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your
immediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business
interruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a
member of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their
employment with Old National.

---

Managers are responsible for monitoring attendance-related issues on a case-by-case basis and taking corrective
action, if required.

***Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action.***

##### Team Member Conduct and Behavior

Each team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual
respect and trust. Our interactions with others, whether with team members, clients, vendors, or people in the
communities we serve will reflect Old National's values and the appreciation we have for each other's contribution and
perspective. In the context of this handbook, it isn't possible to list all the forms of conduct that are considered
unacceptable in the workplace. Instead, we expect team members to use good judgment and common sense in
sustaining a civil and respectful work environment. The Company's values serve as a benchmark for what is
acceptable and what is not, and the company maintains sole discretion in the decision as to what is inappropriate. An
individual's conduct is not acceptable solely because the person believes it to be. Nor may a team member excuse
their conduct because this handbook doesn't specifically prohibit objectionable behavior. Old National expects that
team members recognize that inappropriate conduct, from acts of dishonesty to intimidating or belittling others, is not
acceptable. Several sections of this Handbook, such as Confidential Information, Business Ethics and Conduct,
Conflicts of interest, Absenteeism, Sexual Harassment and Unlawful Harassment and more, speak to the standards of
behavior expected of all team members. Refer to relevant sections of the Handbook for more information on specific
topics or contact your manager or a Human Resource Representative for more information.

Team members are expected to report to any Corporate Security Officer, a Talent team member, HR Shared Services,
their manager, or use the PSAR/SAR process on the Old National Intranet Homepage, all known or suspected criminal
activities affecting the Corporation, its customers, or team members. Withholding information or knowledge of criminal
activity may be cause for prosecution.

***Team members may report any suspicious activity by calling the toll-free hotline 866-ETHICSP.***

This hotline may be used anonymously, if the team member wishes, and without fear of reprisal.

**The following are examples of some of the infractions or conduct that may result in disciplinary action,**
**up to and including termination of employment. This list is not exhaustive, and Old National expects all**
**team members to exercise sound judgment and personal responsibility for their actions and behavior:**

- Acts of dishonesty such as theft, fraud, embezzlement, check kiting operation, misuse of Company credit cards,or other financial crimes.

- Falsification of company records.

- Working under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances.

- Irresponsible, negligent, or improper handling of company assets including systems, email, confidentialinformation, etc.

- Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or controlled substances in the workplace,while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment.

- Engaging in violent acts or threatening conduct.

---

- Failure to meet behavior and performance expectations and/or training expectations for your role.

- Failure to cooperate in Company investigations of workplace misconduct.

- Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct.

- Sexual or other unlawful harassment.

Employment with Old National is at the mutual consent of Old National and the team member, and either party may
terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.

##### Dress Guidelines

Creating a positive first impression paves the way for establishing good relationships. Often the impression you create
is influenced by the way you present yourself, including your attire.

At Old National, we follow a “dress for your day” approach. This means appropriate dress can vary from business to
casual. What is appropriate for each team member on a given day should be dictated by their role and the interaction
they expect to have with customers, fellow team members and others outside Old National on that day.

Please consider your daily schedule when choosing your attire. Even if your circumstances allow for casual clothing,
please remember that your attire is a reflection on you and on Old National.

##### Drug and Alcohol Use

It is Old National’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthy, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, team members
are required to report to work in an appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory
manner.

While on Old National premises or while conducting business related activities away from Old National premises, no
team member may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The legal use of
prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair a team member’s ability to perform the essential
functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace.

Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment,
and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Such violations may also have
legal consequences.

Team members will be required to take an immediate alcohol and/or drug test where reasonable suspicion exists that
a team member is abusing alcohol, using illegal drugs, or using legal drugs illegally, whether on or off duty. Failure to
submit to drug testing and participation in the Employee Assistance Program may be grounds for termination.

Team members with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to use the
resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these matters with their supervisor
or a Human Resources Representative to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community.
Career opportunities after the assistance period will not be diminished as a result of participation in the Employee
Assistance Program.

---

Team members with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should contact
their supervisor or a Human Resources Representative without fear of reprisal.

#### » **Please refer to the Substance Abuse Policy for additional information.**

##### Workplace Problem Resolution Policy

Old National is committed to sustaining a positive work environment in which team members work constructively
together. As part of this commitment, Old National encourages a candid and receptive atmosphere in which any
problem, complaint, question, or suggestion may be discussed, and a timely response provided from your supervisor
and/or a member of the HR Talent team.

**This Policy is intended to:**

- Provide the opportunity to resolve work-related conflict or complaints at an early stage and addressmisunderstandings that may cause a communication breakdown.

- Improve communication and understanding between team members and between team membersand their supervisor.

- Promote flexible, creative solutions.

**Team members should use this Policy to:**

- Discuss concerns about difficulties you may be experiencing with coworkers or a supervisor.

- Address established rules of conduct, policies, practices, or a decision that affects the terms and conditionsof your employment.

Old National strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members, and everyone is expected to treat each
other with mutual respect.

If your supervisor does not resolve your issue, or you are concerned about retaliation, you may contact your next level
supervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services. In the event your issue is not resolved by your
next level supervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services, the team member has the ability to
discuss it with a representative of Senior Management up to and including the appropriate department or line of
business Executive for final resolution. A Talent Manager or Talent Partner will assist the team member, if requested,
in the escalation of the problem to Senior Management.

Not every problem can be resolved to everyone’s total satisfaction, but through understanding and discussion of
mutual problems, team members and management can develop confidence in each other to move forward. This
confidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment.

***Complaints or concerns may also be shared anonymously through EthicsPoint.***

Old National does not tolerate retaliation for good faith reports of ethical violations, misconduct, problems, complaints,
or for using the problem resolution procedure.

---

##### Corrective Action

Every team member’s contribution is important to Old National’s success. Both our external and internal clients depend
on a consistent level of excellence in their interactions with team members. The Company believes that everyone is
responsible for their performance and behavior and expects each team member to meet the expectations for their
position. And we believe that open, honest, and direct communication is critical to the success of each team member
and Old National. Our corrective action process is intended to foster team member success by identifying
unacceptable performance and the cause(s) of the unacceptable performance, agreeing on method(s) for improving
performance to an acceptable level, and preventing recurrence.

In most cases, if you have a performance or behavior issue, your manager will work with you to provide appropriate
performance counseling and corrective action so that you have the opportunity to improve. However, our corrective
action process is not necessarily progressive. This means a manager does not have to use levels of corrective action
consecutively. Managers reserve the right to take the level of corrective action that is appropriate for the situation and,
if necessary, to terminate employment without implementing performance counseling and corrective action.

**The level of performance counseling and corrective action depends on considerations such as:**

- The nature, circumstances, and severity of the issue(s)

- Timing and frequency of previous issues

- The team member’s overall performance

Corrective action options include a verbal, written or final warning, suspension, or termination of employment.
Additionally, during the corrective action process, there may be times when Old National determines that it is
appropriate for you to be out of the workplace, and you may be placed on administrative leave. The Company is
committed to ensuring that performance counseling and corrective action is timely, transparent, and impartial.
Because facts and circumstances can vary widely and are often unique to a particular situation, the action that’s
taken in one situation shouldn’t be interpreted as setting standard for any other situations.

Team members are responsible for actively engaging in the corrective action process and taking appropriate action(s)
to improve their performance or behavior. This may include preparing a plan outlining actions to improve performance,
commitments, and follow-up.

Old National believes that this corrective action process can help to resolve performance and conduct problems at an
early stage.

##### Security Inspections

Old National will maintain a work environment that is free of controlled substances and related paraphernalia, alcohol,
firearms, explosives, or other improper materials such as weapons and sexually explicit materials. Old National
prohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises. In some states, there are additional
laws about this subject; when applicable, state law takes precedence over these guidelines.

Desks, lockers, and other storage devices may be provided for the convenience of team members but remain the sole
property of Old National. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or
representative of Old National at any time, either with or without prior notice.

---

##### Solicitation

To ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by Old National may not solicit or
distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose.

Old National recognizes that team members may have interest in events and organizations outside the workplace.
Solicitation and distribution of literature are prohibited during business hours. Distribution of literature is prohibited in
work areas at all times. ONB Classifieds located on Viva Engage is the official site for posting any items that you are
offering for sale or wish to purchase.

In the case of recognized organizations, such as United Way, your assistance may be solicited by your supervisor or
appropriate member of management. Contributions are voluntary and made on a private and personal basis. While
giving is encouraged, it is not expected.

Old National maintains bulletin boards to communicate Company information to team members and to post notices
required by law. These bulletin boards are for the posting of Company information and notices only, and only people
designated by Human Resources may place notices on or take down material from the bulletin boards. The
unauthorized posting of notices, photographs, or other printed or written materials on bulletin boards or any other
Company property is prohibited.

## Important Policies

In this section, you’ll learn about Old National’s policies such as the Information Users Acknowledgment, Emergency
Closings and many more.

##### Emergency Closings

Emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or earthquakes, can disrupt company operations. The
nature of our business requires us to continue to operate regardless of conditions that might otherwise close other
businesses. Old National is committed to the safety and well-being of all team members and will take appropriate steps
to make sure team members feel safe when continuing business operations during emergency conditions including
permitting team members to perform work from home when possible.

The following guidelines explain various scenarios and how the company will pay you when an emergency scenario
occurs.

**If your business, branch, or department closes during your working hours:**
In extreme cases, when inclement weather conditions or another emergency situation develops during the day,
management may decide to close all or part of its business operations.

- All team members who are instructed to leave early as a result of closed operations will be paid for their normallyscheduled hours that day. Team members who are in a role that work can be performed remotely (home or
another ONB location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on
determining a remote location to work.

- Team members may be asked to work on a day when their department is officially closed. In these circumstances,non-exempt team members who work will receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times the team member’s base
rate of pay. Please contact HR Shared Services for assistance regarding the proper coding of the time.

---

**If your business, branch, or department is open for the day:**
If inclement weather or other emergency conditions exist, team members should report to work, unless they have been
advised by phone, radio, or other means that the business will be closed for the day. If a team member cannot safely
travel to work, they should contact their supervisor. Team members who are in a role that work can be performed
remotely (home or another ONB location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their
managers on determining a remote location to work.

**If your business, branch, or department is closed for the day:**
Under extreme weather or emergency conditions, management may choose to close the business or be required to do
so by Federal, State or Local Authorities. It is our policy to pay team members for their regularly scheduled hours
under these conditions. Team members who are in a role that can be performed remotely (home or another ONB
location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on determining a remote
location to work.

**Pay Practices**
Team members may be paid their regular pay for up to one week of emergency closure pay per calendar year if they
are unable to perform their job duties from a remote setting. If emergency closures exceed one week per year,
executive leaders will review to determine if additional emergency close pay is warranted.

All emergency close pay will be recorded using the Emergency Closing (EMC) pay code for regular hours or the
Emergency Closing Shift (EMS) pay code for shift hours. Emergency Closing Pay will not count as hours worked for
overtime purposes. Please contact HR Shared Services if you have any questions concerning the above.

##### Ergonomics

Old National makes every effort in providing a safe and healthy work environment for all team members. Work-related
repetitive motion injuries (RMIs) are caused by repeated motions and exertions when performing a job, process or
operation and are diagnosed by a licensed physician. The disorder can involve nerves, tendons, muscles and
supporting structure of the musculoskeletal system. Examples of repetitive motion tasks include, but are not limited to,
sustained computer keyboard and mouse usage or lifting, carrying and loading objects.

All team members are encouraged to report all suspected RMls, RMI symptoms, or other ergonomic concerns to HR
Shared Services immediately.

##### Information Users Acknowledgment

**Acceptable Use Policy**

To review the Information Users Acknowledgment on the Old National intranet, navigate to: Divisions > Risk Hub >
Information Security > Awareness.

***Note: Intranet sites are only accessible from within the Old National network and may not be accessed***
***when viewing from home.***

##### Political Activity

---

Before undertaking political activities, including but not limited to running for an elective political office, accepting an
appointment to a governmental board, serving on a political committee, and soliciting co-workers, a team member
must receive written approval from the Chief Legal Counsel or CEO. A team member wishing to take an active role in
local government may be permitted reasonable time off to participate, if properly approved.

The team member’s request should be made in writing and include a memo of support from the immediate supervisor.
Old National accepts and abides by the laws pertaining to monetary contributions to elections for federal office, to
conventions, or to caucuses. Old National suggests that individuals contribute and participate according to their desire
and capability.

##### Sustainability

Sustainability at Old National embodies our corporate commitment to responsible management of our social, cultural,
and economic resources in partnership with our team members, clients, vendors and communities.

Social sustainability is defined as Old National’s ongoing focus on investing in and sustaining our communities.
We accomplish this through Old National Bank Foundation grants, sponsorships, board service by team members,
donations of physical assets and advancing financial literacy and education.

Cultural sustainability is best described as our efforts to maintain and strengthen our community banking culture.
This includes empowering team member volunteerism, providing strong employee development initiatives, promoting
a highly ethical environment and fostering diversity and inclusion.

Economic sustainability focuses on sustaining relationships with our clients and shareholders. This includes strong
corporate governance practices and responsible utilization and conservation of our resources. We are also committed
to promoting economic development through investment in community-strengthening initiatives like historical real
estate, affordable housing, and alternative energy projects.

**ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY**

**Resource Conservation:** Old National supports environmental awareness and sustainability by encouraging
and empowering recycling, responsible waste management practices and energy conservation throughout the
organization.

**This support includes a commitment to:**

- The purchase, use and disposal of products and materials in a manner that best utilizes natural resourcesand minimizes negative environmental impact.

- The promotion of products that lessen environmental impact, such as e-statements and mobile banking.

- The continual evaluation of opportunities to reduce energy dependence in areas such as facilities, equipment,operations, shipping, and business travel.

**Supply Chain:** Through our vendor management process, we seek to identify vendors who not only comply with all
environmental laws and regulations but are committed to protecting the environment and our communities by
supporting initiatives that are aligned with waste minimization and sustainability efforts.

**Team members:** We are committed to educating and supporting our team members in environmentally responsible
practices including recycling, resource reduction and involvement in community initiatives.

---

The simple act of placing a sheet of paper, an aluminum can or a bottle in a recycling container is the first step in
reducing demand for the earth’s limited resources. The success of this program depends on active participation by all
of us. Team members are encouraged to make a commitment to recycle and be a part of this solution. Many Old
National locations provide special recycling receptacles to promote the separation and collection of recyclable
materials.

Other simple steps include the practice of double-sided printed and moving to imaging and electronic document
storage to reduce the use of paper from the onset.

If you have any questions or new ideas and suggestions for the sustainability program, please share them with a
member of the Sustainability Department.

##### Required Training and Compliance

Old National expects its directors, officers, and team members to comply with all required regulations and training.
Compliance with banking and other regulations is the responsibility of every Old National team member. Disregarding
or failing to comply with compliance standards or failure to complete required training could lead to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment.

##### Sexual Harassment and Other Unlawful Harassment Policy

Old National is committed to providing a work environment for all team members, temporary workers, interns,
contractors and vendors that is free of discrimination, sexual harassment and unlawful harassment.

Sexual overtones, actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristic
will not be tolerated.

As an example, sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of team member misconduct that is demeaning to
another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is prohibited and protected by law.

**WHAT IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT**

Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The
law prohibits team members, third party vendors, contractors, as well as supervisors and managers with whom team
members come into contact with from engaging in conduct prohibited by the Act. As defined by the guidelines, sexual
harassment involves: “Unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature when:

1. Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for an employment decisionaffecting such an individual, or

1. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance orcreating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.”

***Examples of prohibited behavior include but are not limited to:***

---

- The display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including any that may be obtained through electronicmeans (Internet, email, text message, etc.) or computer software programs.

- The sending of sexually suggestive or explicit images, comments, jokes, or graphics via email.
- Any uninvited physical contact or touching.
- Manager or other authority figure offers or threatens a team member with a job-related benefit or harm inexchange for a sexual favor.

**REPORTING SEXUAL/ UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT**

Any team member or witness who wishes to report an incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment should promptly
report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the team member believes it would be
inappropriate to contact that person, the team member should immediately contact HR Shared Services or a Talent
Partner/Manager. If the team member believes it is inappropriate to contact any of these individuals, the team member
should immediately contact the Talent Strategy Senior Director (Tela Erdell 812-461-9743) or Chief People Officer
(Carrie Ellspermann 812-464-1307).

Management of Old National strongly disapproves of such conduct and holds its managers and supervisors
responsible for maintaining work environments free from any form of sexual or other unlawful harassment. Any
supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment should promptly advise
HR Shared Services or a Talent Partner/Manager.

**RETALIATION**

Team members can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Old National prohibits retaliation against
any team member who complains of sexual/unlawful harassment or who participates in an investigation. Retaliation
includes, but is not limited to, taking disciplinary action against the team member, reassigning their duties or
workspace, denying requests for leave, demotions, etc. Allegations of retaliation will be investigated, and appropriate
remedial action will be taken.

Old National will not retaliate against a victim of sexual/unlawful harassment for requesting leave or a reasonable
accommodation regardless of whether the request was granted. If you believe you have been retaliated against, you
should immediately report it to your supervisor, a Talent Partner/Manager, the Chief Ethics Officer, the Chief People
Officer, or the Chief Legal Officer.

**INTERNAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURES**

All complaints will be investigated in a prompt and sensitive manner. This is to encourage the reporting of any
incidents of sexual or other unlawful harassment, and to protect the reputation of any team member wrongfully
charged with sexual or other unlawful harassment. Investigations of a complaint will normally include conferring with
the parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses. Every team member shall have a duty to cooperate with
the investigation. All team members are protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination
from filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation. If you believe you have been retaliated against, you should
immediately report it to your supervisor, a Talent Partner/Manager, the Chief Ethics Officer, the Chief People Officer,
or the Chief Legal Officer. A record of the complaint and the findings will become part of the complaint-investigation
record; however, the file will be maintained separately from the team member’s personnel file. Because this kind of
situation may be personally upsetting, team members are reminded of the availability of personal counseling through
our Employee Assistance Program.

---

Anyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. For more information on the guidelines used in investigating and resolving sexual
harassment complaints, you may contact HR Shared Services.

##### Substance Abuse Policy

It is Old National Bancorp’s commitment to provide a drug-free workplace that keeps with the spirit and intent of the
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. That commitment is jeopardized when any team member illegally uses drugs at
home or at work, comes to work under their influence, possesses, distributes, or sells drugs in the workplace, or
abuses alcohol on the job. This conduct is inconsistent with the behavior expected of team members, subjects all team
members and visitors to our facilities to unacceptable safety risks, and undermines Old National Bancorp’s ability to
operate effectively and efficiently.

As part of Old National Bancorp’s commitment to safeguard the well-being of its team members and to provide a safe
environment for everyone, Old National Bancorp has established the following drug-free workplace policy:

- It is a violation of this policy for any team member to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegaldrugs or drug paraphernalia or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job. It is a violation of
this policy for any team member to report to work, be at work, or to engage in work under the influence of illegal
drugs. The definition of “illegal drugs” includes cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), and
cannabinoids, including all medical and recreational cannabis and marijuana products, and any other illegal drug

may suspend the team member for thirty (30) days without pay while the team member completes the EAP. If
follow-up testing is required by the EAP, any future positive test results shall be grounds for discharge. Any team
member who fails to successfully complete the EAP under terms of assistance shall be subject to discharge and
shall not be eligible for rehire.

##### Workplace Violence Prevention

Old National is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment for all team
members. Old National has adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of
(or actual) violence that may occur during business hours or on its premises.

All team members should be treated with civility and respect at all times. Team members are expected to refrain from
fighting, “horseplay,” or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or
hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of Old National without proper authorization.
Firearms may be kept in parking areas in accordance with state law where recognizing such possession is required by
state law.

Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer, including off-duty periods, will not
be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual’s
sex, race, age, national origin, disability, or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

All threats of violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor.
HR Shared Services, and/or the appropriate member of management. You may also contact Corporate Security at 1-
[866-795- 7474 or Security@oldnational.com. This includes threats by team members, as well as threats by customers,](mailto:Security@oldnational.com)
[vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and](mailto:Security@oldnational.com)
detailed as possible.

All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place
yourself in danger. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your workstation, do not try to intercede or see
what is happening. If the situation presented requires attention from Emergency Medical Services, Police, or the Fire
Department, call 911 first. When it is safe and reasonable to do so, notify Corporate Security.

Old National will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence, and of suspicious
individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. To
maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Old National may suspend team members, either with
or without pay, pending investigation.

Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in violation of these
guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Old National encourages team members to bring their disputes or differences with other team members to the
attention of their supervisors or HR Shared Services before the situation escalates into potential violence. Old National
is committed to assist in the resolution of team member disputes and will not discipline individuals for raising valid
concerns.

Team members may be required to reimburse Old National for any charges resulting from their personal use of the
Company’s telephone, facsimile, computer and other communication systems. The mail system is reserved for
business purposes only. Team members should refrain from sending or receiving personal mail at the workplace.

To ensure effective telephone communications, team members should always speak in a courteous and professional
manner. Please confirm information received from the caller and hang up only after the caller has done so.

##### Workplace Monitoring

Workplace monitoring may be conducted by Old National to ensure quality control, team member safety, security, and
customer satisfaction.

Regulatory requirements and prevalent industry practices may result in the Company monitoring or recording team
member phone conversations. For example, team members who work in wire-transfer positions or “Customer Call
Centers” may have their phone calls monitored. Improved job performance enhances our customers’ image of Old
National as well as their satisfaction with our service. Voice traffic and modem traffic on fax lines, after-hours long-
distance calling, as well as other telephone monitoring activities may be performed to maintain the confidentiality of
client data and protect system’s security.

monitored or accessed.

Old National may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. Examples include ATM locations, drive
thru windows, etc. Video monitoring is used to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft, and
misconduct, and discourage or prevent acts of harassment and workplace violence.

Because Old National is sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of team members, every effort will be made to
guarantee that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner.

##### Equipment and Vehicles

Team members are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions,
safety standards, and guidelines.

Please notify your supervisor if any equipment, machines, or tools appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of
repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent deterioration of equipment and
possible injury to team members or others.

The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment can result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment. Team members who are involved in an accident while traveling
on business must promptly notify their immediate supervisor. Vehicles leased or rented by Old National may not be
used for personal use without prior approval.

potential distractions and disturbances.

directions or be escorted to their destination. Team members are responsible for the conduct and safety of their
guests.

supervisor and direct the individual to the reception area, if applicable.

approval has been granted by a department manager. Approval is contingent on the nature and purpose of the
organization, the benefit to be derived for the team member and the Company, the current number of memberships
already paid by the Company, and the team member’s job level and length of service. Once membership is approved,
the individual is expected to participate actively in the organization.
