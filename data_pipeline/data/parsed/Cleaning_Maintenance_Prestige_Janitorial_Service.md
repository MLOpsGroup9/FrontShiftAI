Section 2. Terms and Definitions

Prestige Janitorial Services typically employs more than 50 employees regular and temporary employees
on an ”at will” basis. This section defines the terms at will employment, as well as the different types of
employees we hire.

2.1 Definition of “At-Will “Employment

The job of an” at-will” employee is not guaranteed. It may be ended, at any time with or without
prejudice without notice, and by the employee or, for a lawful reason, by the company. The company
also reserves the right to alter an “at-will” employee’s benefits, pay rate, and assignment as it sees fit.
The “at-will” terms of an employee’s employment may only be changed by the President.

2.2 Types of Workers

This section distinguishes between the different types of workers that the company employs. Employee
status is established at the time of hire and only be altered be a written statement signed by the
company.

Exempt versus non-exempt

The majority of employees are nonexempt, meaning they're entitled by law to at least minimum wage
and premium pay for overtime. Exempt employees are not subject to these laws. Exempt status is
defined by particular standard set by state law and federal labor standards act (FLSA). This class of
employee is usually an executive, administrator, or a highly paid specialist. As of 2017, salary to be
considered exempt must exceed $47,476.

Regular versus temporary

Regular employees work a regular schedule, either on a full-time or part-time basis. To be considered
full-time, an employee must work at least 40 hours per week. A temporary employee is a person we hire
for a short period (usually three months at a maximum) to assist with a project or remedy a staff
shortage. A temporary employee is also employed on “at-will” basis.

Independent contractors and consultants

Independent contractors and consultants are not company employees, but rather self-employed
professionals who we hire for specific projects. Unlike employees, they do not operate under company
direction, and control their own methods, materials and schedules. They are not eligible for company
benefits.

    3.     That there is reason to suspect that the employee in question may have been
           involved.

reimbursing the polygraph fee by means of payroll deduction of separate reimbursement.
