Congratulations and welcome. We are pleased
to have you join our award-winning Hospitality
Services department. We know you have lots
of choices for where to work in the Hospitality
industry, and we’re glad you chose Western. You’re
now part of a team who cares deeply about taking
care of our guests, and contribute to a supportive
campus community made up of faculty, staff,
researchers, alumni, and our 35,000 students.

We consist of five distinct teams – Campus
Eateries, Residence Dining, Great Hall Catering,
Conference Services, and Vending Services, and
provide contract management to the Ivey School
of Business. While each area serves a specific
clientele, we are all part of the same team and
work collectively towards shared outcomes.

Feeding over 25,000 people on campus daily,
Hospitality Services staff are key to delivering
Canada’s “Best Student Experience”. We all deliver
exceptional customer service everyday in different

ways; learning our guest’s names, remembering
their regular orders, striking up friendly
conversations, asking how a student did on their
midterm – our Alumni often return to campus
and seek out Hospitality employees who made a
difference in their experience at Western.

I encourage you to spend some time looking
through the Employee Handbook carefully and
return the signed acknowledgement form to
your Supervisor within two weeks of receiving
this publication.

Again, I am extremely pleased to welcome you to
Hospitality Services and look forward to working
with you.

Sincerely,

Chris Alleyne
*Associate Vice-President*
*Housing & Ancillary Services*

## Welcome to the Team!

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an
authentication method in which a user is granted
access only after successfully presenting two or
more pieces of evidence to prove their identity.
Duo Security is being used to secure MFA enabled
services at Western University.

## Why Do I Need This?

Passwords alone aren’t enough anymore,
that’s why Western is introducing Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA). Passwords can often be
stolen, guessed, or compromised — you might not
even know someone is accessing your account.
Multi‐factor authentication adds a second layer of
security, keeping your account secure even if your
password is compromised.

## How Does It Work?

MFA provides you with the best level of security,
it’s fast and easy to use. When you log into an
MFA protected site, service or application, such
as Office 365, you will enter your User ID and
password as you normally do and you will use a
secondary factor as well. MFA adds a second layer
of protection by combining something you know
(your password) with something you have (your
phone, or security token) to verify your identity.
This combination will prevent someone else from
gaining access to your account, even if they have
compromised your password.

Once you have set up your Duo Security profile
you are ready to go. You will login as usual with
your User ID and password, and then use your
device to verify that it’s you. This can be done
via SMS, voice call, one time passcode, the Duo
Mobile smartphone app, and so on.

## No mobile phone?

You can also use a landline or tablet, or obtain a
hardware token. Duo lets you link multiple devices
to your account, so you can use your mobile
phone and a landline, a landline and a hardware
token, two different mobile devices, etc.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## HAACP

Hospitality Services uses a universally recognized
Food Safety Program called HACCP (Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point). This seven-step
program tracks food products from the farm to
the fork, removing all hazards by identifying food
hazards and critical control points.

Your role is to ensure that all products are safely
handled from the moment we receive it at
our loading docks to the point our customers
consume it.

Careful monitoring, documentation and record
keeping are shared responsibilities to ensure we
keep our self and customers safe.

## Personal Hygiene

Poor personal hygiene can compromise the
safety of our food service establishment. Students
and Staff can become ill. It is the responsibility
of all staff members to follow a high standard of
personal hygiene which includes daily baths or
showers, wearing a clean uniform, retraining hair
with a hair net and proper handwashing.

## Handwashing

Unclean hands are the prime culprits in
transmitting contaminants to food and there is no
better means of sanitizing hands than frequent
and through handwashing.

**WHEN DO I WAS MY HANDS?**

- Before starting my shift
- After using the restroom

- After touching face or hair or clothing
- After sneezing, coughing or blowing nose
- After handing raw food
- After eating and taking breaks
- After smoking
- After handling dirty dishes
- After handling garbage

- After handling chemicals
## Gloves

Gloves may be worn at a customer’s request,
to protect a cut or when handling ready to eat
food. Gloves are single use or task only. Gloves
can become contaminated just as easily as a
worker’s hands. They are intended to be changed
frequently, never washed but discarded after use.

## Food Holding Temperatures

**Minimize the time food spends in the**
**temperature danger zone 40°F (5°C) to 140°F**
**(60°C)** . Potentially harmful bacteria find this zone
highly hospitable and begin to multiple quickly.

When it is necessary to hold hot foods for any
length of time only equipment intended for
such purposes should be used (e.g. steam table
or hot cabinet).

- Keep **HOT** things **HOT** **above** **140°F (60°C)**

- When holding cold food out of refrigeration onlyequipment intended for such purposes should
be used. e.g. deli counter, ice bath

- Keep **COLD** things **COLD** **below 40°F (4°C)**
## Cooling

All cooked food must be chilled quickly to **40°F**
( **4°C** ) within 6 hours to prevent a potential
food-borne illness. Large quantity batches
can be chilled using an ice bath, with an
ice wand or divided into
shallow pans to increase the
surface area before storing
in the refrigerator. Use a
thermometer to determine
the internal temperature of
the product.

## Reheating

Precooked foods to be
reheated must be rewarmed
rapidly to **165°F (74°C)** using
equipment to do so. A hot
box or steam table is not
appropriate for reheating.

## Thawing

Products should be thawed under refrigeration
or under cold running water in their original
wrapping never at room temperature.

## Thermometers

Metal Stem or Instant Read Digital thermometers
are available to check product internal
temperatures. These thermometers need to be
cleaned between uses with alcohol swabs and
should be calibrated frequently.

All fridges and Freezers are equipped with
thermometers and should be checked regularly.

## Cross Contamination

It is important to take all precautions to avoid
Cross Contamination of products meaning the
process by which bacteria, microorganisms
or hazardous materials are unintentionally
transferred from one product to another with
harmful effect through careless practices.

**To avoid cross contamination practice**
**the following:**

- Wash hands between tasks

- Sanitize thermometers after each use

- When thawing raw foods in therefrigerator, place them on the
lowest shelf

- Use a clean designated scoop for ice, donot use hands or other container

- All staff beverages should be in a cupwith lid and stored in designated area to
avoid spilling and contaminating food
prep areas

- Keep ready to eat items apart fromraw items

## Fire

In case of fire accidents, fumes and theft,
individuals should **call University Police at**
**ext. 83300 or 911 immediately.** When a fire is
discovered, the building must be evacuated. If
it is safe to do so, all doors to the fire area should
be closed and the nearest wall mounted fire
alarm activated. When the fire alarm rings,
the building must be evacuated as quickly as
possible but elevators must not be used. Doors
and windows in the area should be closed.
The building must not be re-entered until
authorization to do so has been given by the Fire
Department or Western Police.

All cooking appliances should be turned off and
food that could catch on fire should be removed
from its’ heat source (French fries should be
removed from the deep fryer).

If the fire is under a kitchen hood, activate the
fire extinguishing system using a manual “Range
Guard” pull station. You must also pull the nearest
fire alarm to sound the building alarm.

## Fire Extinguishers

There may be up to three different types of fire
extinguishers in your kitchen:

- **Multipurpose Extinguisher (ABC):** This type ofextinguisher will extinguish all types of fires.

- **BC Extinguisher:** This type of extinguisherworks extremely well on grease fires, and can
be used on any flammable liquid fires involving
electricity.

- **Range Guard Fire Extinguishing System:**This fire extinguishing system is located in the
exhaust ducts and hoods over certain cooking
appliances. It will operate automatically if there
is a fire on a cooing appliance, or manually
if the pin in a Range Guard pull station is
removed. This system, when activated will
shut off all fuel sources to the appliances under
the hood, discharge the extinguishing agent
on the appliances and an alarm will sound. A
fire alarm must also be pulled to sound the
building alarm.

## Food Allergies & Intolerances

Food allergies are a growing public health issue in
Canada and approximately 2.5 million Canadians
self-report having at least one food allergy.

A food allergy is a medical condition in which one’s
immune system mistakenly treats a particular food
as if it’s dangerous to them. Their body reacts to
the food (an allergen) by having an allergic reaction
– even a small amount of an allergen has the
potential to cause a reaction. And, unfortunately
there is no cure for a food allergy; avoidance is the
only way to prevent a reaction.

At Western, we house and serve many students
(staff and/or faculty) with food allergies and
intolerances. While anaphylaxis (the most severe
type of reaction) can lead to death if untreated,
fatalities can often be avoided.

## Symptoms of an
## Allergic Reaction

An allergic reaction
can result in any
of the following
symptoms, which
may appear alone or
in any combination,
regardless of the
triggering allergens.

Think **F.A.S.T.**
and look for the
following signs:

**Face:** Itchiness,
redness, swelling of
face and tongue

**Airway:** Trouble breathing, swallowing or
speaking

**Stomach** : Nausea, pain/cramps, vomiting,
diarrhea

**Total Body:** Rash, itchiness, swelling, weakness,
paleness, sense of doom, loss of consciousness.

## Emergency Response
```

There are five key steps to take in the emergency
management of a reaction:

1. **Administer epinephrine** (ie., EpiPen orAllerject) at the first signs of an allergic
reaction. Epinephrine will not cause harm
if given unnecessarily to an individual not
experiencing an allergic reaction. Staff should
only assist in administering epinephrine if/
when the person having the reaction is unable
to do so themselves.

1. **Call 9-1-1 from a campus phone**

2. **Individuals feeling faint or dizzy, should****lie down unless they are vomiting or**
**experiencing severe respiratory distress**
**(trouble breathing).**

1. **If there is no improvement in symptoms after****five minutes, a second dose of epinephrine**
**can be administered by SERT.**

1. **Immediately report the incident** to your UnitManager and/or Supervisor.

Education and awareness are key to keeping our
allergic community safe. Please complete your
ALLERGY AWARE on-line training. A link to which
can be found on the staff website.
**www.allergyaware.ca**

## Accommodating Students
## with Allergies

The safety of our students is a shared
responsibility. We encourage our students with
food allergies to self-identify so that we can work
together to keep them safe. It is, therefore, very
important that patrons with food allergies have
their inquiries dealt with accurately, completely,
and promptly. Food allergen-related inquiries
should be directed to the Unit Supervisor, Chef, or
Manager on duty in your unit.

## Other Resources:

**foodallergycanada.ca**

**nutrition.uwo.ca**

Over 90% of
people with a food
allergy are allergic to
one, or more of
these allergens.

**FOOD ALLERGY CANADA CALL THESE THE PRIORITY ALLERGENS.**

the information sheets available from your

manager or supervisor in each unit. The
information sheets provide step-by-step
instructions to easily add your @uwo email to
your Apple iOS device, or Android device.

- Forgot your password? That’s okay! Contactyour manager/supervisor for easy instructions
how to change or re-set your password.

# Communication

and your family, and may be in the best position
to offer advice and help. You may also go to a
walk-in clinic for assistance.

Western also has a number of resources that you
may access, as a faculty or staff member.

**The most important thing is to ask for**
**assistance.** In an emergency, call 911 or go to a
local emergency room (ER). Visiting an ER can
help connect you to the right resources.
