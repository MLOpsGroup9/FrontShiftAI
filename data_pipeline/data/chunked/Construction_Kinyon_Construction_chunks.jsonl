Employees are expected to be at work, ready to begin work, at the beginning of their assigned\nshift. ---\n\n## Page 10\n\nOvertime Hours\n\nEmployees shall be paid for their hours worked in accordance with all legal requirements. Employees who qualify as administrative, executive, or professional employees within the\nmeaning of the state and federal wage and hour laws are exempt from overtime pay and are not\nsubject to this policy. Because of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the\nCompany requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible. Overtime hours by a non-exempt employee must be approved in advance by an employee’s\nsupervisor. Because unauthorized overtime is against company policy, employees who work\nunauthorized overtime are subject to discipline, possibly including termination. Sick time and\nholiday hours paid but not worked are not included in calculating overtime. Overtime is based only\non actual hours worked as required by law. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate for all hours over\neight hours in one workday or 40 hours in one workweek. Overtime is computed on the basis of a\nnon-exempt employee’s total hours worked in a workday and a workweek. Hours paid for that are\nnot worked (e.g. sick days) do not count as hours worked for overtime purposes. Overtime hours in excess of twelve in one workday are paid at double-time for non-exempt\nemployees. Hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a week are calculated at one and onehalf times the non-exempt employee’s regular rate. Hours worked performed over eight hours on\nthe seventh consecutive day of work also are paid at the non-exempt employee’s double time rate. California Meal and Rest Period Policy\n\nKinyon Construction complies with federal and state legal requirements concerning meal and rest\nperiods. The Company recognizes that employees perform at their best when they have the rest and\nnourishment they need. This policy explains when the Company expects employees to take meal\nand rest periods. Any employee, supervisor, or manager who fails to observe meal and rest period policies will be\nsubject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this policy\nshould be reported to any supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Every report will be\nfully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report\nalleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the Company’s investigation of such reports. Any form of retaliation in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination. Overtime Hours\n\nEmployees shall be paid for their hours worked in accordance with all legal requirements. Employees who qualify as administrative, executive, or professional employees within the\nmeaning of the state and federal wage and hour laws are exempt from overtime pay and are not\nsubject to this policy. Because of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the\nCompany requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible. Overtime hours by a non-exempt employee must be approved in advance by an employee’s\nsupervisor. Because unauthorized overtime is against company policy, employees who work\nunauthorized overtime are subject to discipline, possibly including termination. Sick time and\nholiday hours paid but not worked are not included in calculating overtime. Overtime is based only\non actual hours worked as required by law. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate for all hours over\neight hours in one workday or 40 hours in one workweek. Overtime is computed on the basis of a\nnon-exempt employee’s total hours worked in a workday and a workweek.
