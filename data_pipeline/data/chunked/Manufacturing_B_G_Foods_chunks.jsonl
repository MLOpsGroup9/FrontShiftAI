GM’s who are not present at the time a minor violation occurs will receive the following disciplinary action:\n (1) A written warning for the first state violation.

Any questions in connection with this policy should be directed to the Director of Operations or his or her\ndesignee. OUR DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES\n\nGenerally, most discipline problems can be resolved in the early stages. However, depending upon the\nnature and severity of the problem, the Company may enact any disciplinary measure (verbal or written\nnotice, probation, or termination) at any time, without progressing through each stage of the normal\nprocedures. The following disciplinary actions will generally be used in handling unacceptable\nperformance or behavior. Verbal Warning - The Manager-in-Charge may discuss unacceptable performance or behavior\nwith you. The discussion will indicate the nature of the problem and the action necessary to correct\nit. Written Warning - When a problem continues despite a verbal warning, the Manager-in-Charge\nmay prepare a written warning to be discussed with you. Probation Period - A probation period (normally 30 days) may be incorporated in either the first\nor a subsequent written warning. You should realize that probation is the final step prior to\ntermination should improvement in performance or conduct fail to be achieved within the\nprobationary period. Termination - If prior disciplinary action fails to resolve the problem, the General Manager will\ndocument a recommendation for termination of employment. You will then be notified of the\n\n---\n\n## Page 46\n\ntermination by the General Manager. Certain actions may result in immediate termination of\n employment, without prior disciplinary action. WHEN SUSPENSION BECOMES NECESSARY\nA suspension without pay may be justified when circumstances reasonably require an investigation of a\nserious incident in which you have allegedly been involved. Suspension without pay may be imposed for\nsuch proven misconduct as intentional violation of work or safety rules. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM\nWe are committed to treating all employees fairly and honestly. Our success depends upon the results of\nindividual and team efforts, and each employee’s satisfaction with his or her job. You are encouraged to\ntalk to the General Manager or the Manager-in-Charge if a problem arises in the work environment. If the problem is not resolved by the General Manager or Manager-in-Charge, you may ask for a meeting\nwith the Area Coach and/or Director of Operations and General Manager or Manager-in-Charge in an effort\nto work things out.
