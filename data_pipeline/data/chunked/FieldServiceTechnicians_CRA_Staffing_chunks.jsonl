Payday is every Friday. Pay period ends on Sunday, and pay is dispersed\nvia pay card or direct deposit of your choosing. In the event payday falls on a holiday, the payday will be\nobserved on the preceding business day. Any changes required as applicable to funds distribution must be\nreceived one week prior to effective date of change and the notification must be submitted in writing inclusive\nof proper documentation from your bank as well. Overtime Pay\nRegular employees will be paid in accordance with federal and state law. The Fair Labor Standards Act provides that all non-exempt employees are eligible to receive overtime pay for all\ntime worked over forty (40) hours in any one work week and in the state of California to receive overtime pay\nfor all time worked over eight (8) hours per day in any one work week. Although the FLSA does not require the\nCompany to do so, the Company has voluntarily chosen to pay overtime to its exempt employees, as well. You have been hired by the Company to perform work under the expectation of adaptability to a fluctuating\nschedule. In such cases in which you must complete tasks to meet project deadlines you may be requested to\nwork overtime. Refusal to work overtime is considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary actions up\nto and including termination. Rest and Meal Periods\nAll rest and meal periods will be in accordance with state and federal law. To the extent the law does not require rest and meal breaks, field employees will be provided a 15-minute paid\nrest break in the morning and an additional in the evening - assuming the employee is working a full shift. Field\nemployees scheduled to work more than a five hour period will be provided a 30-minute unpaid meal period. Meal breaks and/or rest breaks must be taken only when approved by a manager or shift leader to avoid\ndisturbance on site. Time Keeping\nAll employees are required to sign-in on the CRAS and/or client preferred sign-in sheet when they arrive on site\nand sign-out upon their departure from work. Employees are not allowed to sign-in more than 5 minutes before\nscheduled shift and 15 minutes after their scheduled shift without manager approval. Time cards are official\nbusiness records and may not be altered without the employee’s supervisor’s approval and may not be falsified\nin any way. Failure to abide within these standards set forth may lead to disciplinary action up to and including\ntermination. Payroll Deductions\nVarious payroll deductions are made each pay period to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes\nand insurance. Deductions will be made for the following: Federal and State Income Tax Withholding, Social\nSecurity, Medicare, State Disability and Family Temporary Disability Insurance, Employee portion health\ninsurance premium as chosen upon hire date, any Company provided advances (payday advance and/or hotel\ndirect advances) and other items by you or required by law (including a valid court order). You can adjust your\nfederal and state income tax withholding by completing the proper federal or state form and submitting to a\nmember of the CRAS corporate office.
