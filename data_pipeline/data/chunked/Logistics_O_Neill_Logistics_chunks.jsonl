The background check may consist of prior employment verification,\nreference checks, education confirmation, criminal background, credit history, or other\ninformation, as permitted by law. Third-party services may be hired to perform these\nchecks. All offers of employment and continued employment are contingent upon a\nsatisfactory background check. Refusal to consent to a background check may result in\ndiscipline, up to or including termination. AT-WILL NOTICE\nThe employment relationship between the Company and employees is at-will. This means\nthat employees are not hired for any specified period of time and their employment may\nbe terminated at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either\nthe Company or the employee. Company policy requires that all employees are at-will;\nany implied, oral, or written agreements or promises to the contrary are void and\nunenforceable, unless approved by an officer with the power to create an employment\ncontract. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other\nCompany document or written or verbal statement or policy. ANNIVERSARY DATE AND SENIORITY\nThe employee’s date of hire is their official employment anniversary date. Seniority is the\nlength of continuous service starting on that date. Should an employee leave the\nCompany and then be rehired, previously accrued seniority will be lost and seniority will\nbegin to accrue again on the date of rehire. With the exception of certain protected leaves\nand paid time off, seniority does not accrue during leaves of absence that exceed 30\ncalendar days. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE\nAll employees are required to complete Section 1 of Form I-9 on their first day of\nemployment, and produce, within three business days, acceptable proof of their identity\nand eligibility to work in the United States. Failure to produce the proper identifying\ndocuments within three days will result in termination. INTRODUCTORY PERIOD\nThe employee's first 90 days of employment with the Company are considered an\nintroductory period. This introductory period will be a time for getting to know fellow\nemployees, managers and the tasks involved in the position, as well as becoming familiar\nwith the Company's products and services. The supervisor or manager will work closely\nwith each employee to help them understand the needs and processes of their job. This introductory period is a try-out time for the employee and the Company.

At the end of the introductory period, the supervisor or manager will discuss each\nemployee's job performance with them. During the course of the discussion, employees\nare encouraged to give their comments and ideas as well. Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment for any\nspecified period of time, nor does it require that an employee be discharged only for\ncause. Completion of the introductory period also does not imply that employees now\nhave a contract of employment with the Company, other than at-will. Successful\ncompletion of the introductory period does not alter the at-will employment relationship. A former employee who has been rehired after a separation from the Company of more\nthan one year is considered an introductory employee during their first 90 days following\nrehire. EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS\nThe Company has established the following employee classifications for compensation\nand benefit purposes only. An employee's supervisor or manager will inform the\nemployee of their classification, status, and responsibilities at the time of hire, re-hire,\npromotion or at any time a change in status occurs. These classifications do not alter the\nemployment at-will status. Regular Full-Time Employee\nAn employee who is regularly scheduled to work no less than 30 hours/week. The\nemployee may be exempt or non-exempt and is generally eligible for all employment\nbenefits offered by the Company. Regular Part-Time Employee\nAn employee who is regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours in a workweek and\nmay be eligible for some benefits. Temporary Employee\nAn employee who is scheduled to work on a specific need of the Company. The employee\nwill not receive any benefits unless specifically authorized in writing. Exempt\nEmployees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards\nAct (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours\nrequired to meet their work responsibilities. performance or other relevant factors do not measure up to our standards, the Company\nmay terminate employment.

EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS\nThe Company has established the following employee classifications for compensation\nand benefit purposes only. An employee's supervisor or manager will inform the\nemployee of their classification, status, and responsibilities at the time of hire, re-hire,\npromotion or at any time a change in status occurs. These classifications do not alter the\nemployment at-will status. Regular Full-Time Employee\nAn employee who is regularly scheduled to work no less than 30 hours/week. The\n\nemployee may be exempt or non-exempt and is generally eligible for all employment\nbenefits offered by the Company.

Employees may review their own personnel file by making a written request to their\nmanager or Human Resources. The written request will become a part of the employee's\npersonnel file. Review of files must take place in the presence of the employee's manager\nor Human Resources.
