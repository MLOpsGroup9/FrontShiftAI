The conduct prohibited by this policy includes conduct in any form, whether verbal, non-verbal,\nvisual, written, or physical. This includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, voice mail, Internet activity, text\nmessages, pictures, images, objects, writings, words, gestures, or physical contact. In general, discrimination and harassment can be deﬁned as conduct that disparages or shows\nhostility or aversion toward a protected status. It can take many forms, including: epithets or slurs;\nthreats; derogatory names, comments, objects or visual depictions; jokes or teasing; and other\nverbal, nonverbal, written, visual or physical conduct that is based on a protected status. Sexual harassment in particular can include a range of subtle or blatant behaviors and may involve\nindividuals of the same or diﬀerent gender. It can be generally deﬁned as: unwelcome sexual\nadvances, requests for sexual favors, and/or conduct of a sexual nature including, but not limited to,\nsexually-related images, jokes, teasing, uninvited touching or other sexually-related conduct when:\n\n- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of anindividual's employment;\n\n- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis foremployment decisions aﬀecting such individual; or\n\n- such conduct has the purpose or eﬀect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's workperformance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or oﬀensive working environment. Sexual harassment does not need to be motivated by sexual desire to be unlawful or to violate this\npolicy. For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of their gender, gender identity or\nexpression, or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment, regardless of whether the\ntreatment is motivated by sexual desire. Additional examples of sexual harassment include:\n\n- Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:o Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another\nemployee’s body or poking another employee’s body;\no Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults. - Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:o Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target’s\njob performance evaluation, a promotion or other job beneﬁts or detriments;\no Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities. - Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or comments about a person’s sexuality orsexual experience, which create a hostile work environment. - Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered inappropriate simplybecause they may not conform to other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a\nparticular sex should act or look. *The key symbolizes ownership and trust. As a Home Bank*\n*team member, you are entrusted with representing us well.*\n\n---\n\n- Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual’s sex, sexual orientation,gender identity or the status of being transgender, such as:\no Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person’s workstation, tools or equipment, or\notherwise interfering with the individual’s ability to perform the job;\no Sabotaging an individual’s work;\no Bullying, yelling, name-calling. Harassment, whether sexual or based on another protected status, is not limited to the physical\nworkplace itself. It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at bank-sponsored\nevents.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [8724, 13560], "sentence_count": 19, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["sexual", "conduct", "such", "other", "physical"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "21e198c75f76ae7b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.372186", "token_count": 991}}
{"text": "Harassment, whether sexual or based on another protected status, is not limited to the physical\nworkplace itself. It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at bank-sponsored\nevents. Calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees can also constitute workplace\nharassment, even if they occur away from the workplace, on personal devices, or during\nnon-working hours. Those in supervisory or leadership positions are expected to have a high level of consciousness\nregarding this policy and must promptly advise Human Resources of any potential incidents of\nharassment or discrimination. Speciﬁcally, with respect to sexual harassment, no supervisor,\nmanager, or oﬃcer shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that any individual’s\nsubmission to or rejection of sexual advances will in any way inﬂuence any personnel decisions\nregarding that person’s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or\nany other term or condition of employment. Individuals must remain mindful that when conduct that may violate this policy occurs, it is not the\nintent of the person(s) engaging in the conduct that matters. Rather, it is the nature of the conduct,\nhow that conduct is perceived, and the impact that conduct has on others that matters. A victim of discrimination, harassment or other similar conduct does not have to be the intended\nrecipient of the behavior. It can be anyone who ﬁnds the behavior oﬀensive and feels aﬀected by\nsuch behavior. If you believe you have been subject to conduct prohibited by this policy or become\naware of such conduct, you should report the situation immediately to your supervisor, Human\nResources, or any member of management with whom you feel comfortable. This applies whether\nthe party involved is an employee, someone in management, a customer, a vendor, or any member\nof the public with whom you come in contact as part of your employment. Anyone witnessing or\nreceiving a report about possible harassment must report the situation to Human Resources\nimmediately. Home Bank will investigate all reports promptly and fairly and in accordance with any legal\nrequirements. While the Bank will maintain conﬁdentiality to the extent possible, complete\nconﬁdentiality cannot be guaranteed, as the duty to investigate and take appropriate action may\nrequire the disclosure of information to individuals with a need to know. If Home Bank determines that discrimination, harassment, or other prohibited conduct has occurred,\nappropriate action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees should also know that if they engage\nin unlawful harassment, they can be held personally liable for the misconduct. Retaliation or adverse action will not be taken against an employee who, in good faith, reports or\nparticipates in an investigation under this policy. Retaliation occurs when an employee experiences a\nnegative consequence because they, in good faith, ﬁled a complaint or participated in an\ninvestigation. Retaliation is illegal and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination, even if no evidence of harassment discrimination, or related conduct is found. ---\n\nHome Bank takes its commitment very seriously to provide an environment free of harassment,\ndiscrimination, and retaliation, and our policy is meant to ensure employees feel comfortable asking\nquestions or raising concerns. You are encouraged to contact your supervisor or Human Resources\nfor any questions or concerns. You may also seek additional information about harassment and\ndiscrimination from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as the applicable\nstate agency:\n\n- Florida Commission on Human Relations\n- Louisiana Commission on Human Rights\n- Mississippi Department of Employment Security\n- Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission\n- Texas Workforce Commission\nOur commitment to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination is unwavering, and\nit is the responsibility of every single employee at Home Bank to foster a welcoming and respectful\nenvironment that is aligned with this commitment. ###### Reasonable Accommodations\n**Accommodations for Disability**\nHome Bank is committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualiﬁed persons with\ndisabilities who can perform the essential functions of their job, with or without reasonable\naccommodation, provided such accommodations impose no undue hardship on the Bank. Unless\nyou inform us otherwise, Home Bank assumes that you can perform the essential functions of your\njob without any accommodation. If you are a qualiﬁed individual with a disability and you require a\nreasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of your job, notify your\nsupervisor or Human Resources. Whether accommodation is required, whether it is feasible, and the type of accommodation that is\nprovided is dependent upon many factors. To facilitate this process, you may be asked about the\ntype of accommodation you believe is necessary, the functional limitations caused by your disability,\nand/or permission to obtain information from your healthcare provider.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "char_span": [13560, 18810], "sentence_count": 28, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0002", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0004", "keywords": ["that", "this", "conduct", "your", "human"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "21e59d475f216e79", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.377267", "token_count": 1015}}

To facilitate this process, you may be asked about the\ntype of accommodation you believe is necessary, the functional limitations caused by your disability,\nand/or permission to obtain information from your healthcare provider. **Accommodations for Pregnancy**\nSimilarly, an employee may have a need for a reasonable accommodation due to pregnancy or\nconditions related to pregnancy. In accordance with applicable law, the Bank will work with\nemployees to provide reasonable accommodations, provided the accommodation does not impose\nan undue hardship on the Bank. Such accommodations may include: more frequent or longer\nbreaks; time oﬀ to attend to a pregnancy complication or recover from childbirth; acquisition or\nmodiﬁcation of equipment or seating; a temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position;\nprivate non-bathroom space for expressing breast milk; assistance with manual labor; and\nmodiﬁcation of work schedule. Employees should discuss their need for accommodation with their\nsupervisor or Human Resources so the Bank can work with the employee to explore options. **Religious Accommodations**\nReasonable accommodation for an employee’s sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, and\npractices may be provided when a need for such accommodation is identiﬁed and is possible. A\nreasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the conﬂict between an employee’s religious\nbeliefs, observances, or practices and the employee’s job requirements, without causing undue\nhardship to the Bank. Employees needing this type of accommodation should speak with their\nsupervisor or Human Resources. ---\n\n###### We Own Our Intellectual Property\nThe protection of conﬁdential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and\nsuccess of Home Bank. Conﬁdential information is any and all information disclosed to or known by\nyou because of employment with the company that is not generally known to people outside the\ncompany about its business. Conﬁdential information includes, but is not limited to, customer or\nemployee information and ﬁnancial data. If an employee has a question about whether any\ndocument or information is conﬁdential in nature, they should treat such documents or information\nas conﬁdential unless expressly advised otherwise by HR or a member of management. An employee who improperly uses or discloses trade secrets, conﬁdential business information,\nclient or employee information will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment and legal action, even if they do not actually beneﬁt from the disclosed information. Home Bank information (including but not limited to documents, notes, ﬁles, records, computer ﬁles\nor similar materials) may not be removed from our premises without permission from Home Bank. **Conﬁdential Information Regarding Customers and Others**\nYou must take all reasonable measures to protect the conﬁdentiality of non-public information about\nus or our subsidiaries and our customers, shareholders and suppliers obtained or created in\nconnection with your activities and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such information unless\nrequired by applicable law or regulation or legal or regulatory process. ###### Conﬁdential Information\nThe integrity of Home Bank necessitates that each of us maintain the highest degree of\nconﬁdentiality when handling internal matters. Conﬁdential Information includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- corporate planning data;\n- pending projects and proposals;\n- proprietary information;\n- research and development designs and strategies;\n- sales or marketing strategies;\n- business operations, ﬁnancial data, and conditions;\n- pricing and cost data;\n- computer software systems, speciﬁcations, and related data;\n- vendor, supplier, or customer lists and transactions; and\n- other similar information. This applies to conﬁdential information in any format, including verbal and written, and extends to all\nforms of technology, including, but not limited to, e-mail, computers, cell phones, and USB drives. You must take necessary measures to protect conﬁdential information, including but not limited to,\nuse of passwords and other security measures, securing ﬁles and documents when away from the\nworkstation, locking drawers at the end of the workday, etc. Anyone who improperly uses or discloses conﬁdential information will be subject to disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination, even if they do not actually beneﬁt from the disclosed\ninformation. Home Bank also reserves the right to pursue any legal measures it deems appropriate\nto address any actual or potential harm to the Bank resulting from violations of this policy, and the\nemployee who improperly discloses or uses the information may be subject to legal action by other\nparties. ---\n\n**Media and Outside Inquiries**\nAll inquiries concerning the Bank, its customers, or its operations must be passed to the Marketing\nDepartment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [18810, 23909], "sentence_count": 23, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["information", "conﬁdential", "accommodation", "employee", "bank"], "policy_tags": ["REST"], "hash_64": "29cd0d465f63ce69", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.381315", "token_count": 1023}}

No one is authorized to make statements or release information on behalf of the Bank\nunless it is part of the employee’s assigned job duties or express permission has been granted by\nthe Marketing Department. ###### Conﬂict of Interest\nHome Bank expects you to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards. Remember,\nat Home Bank we do the right thing (always). Business dealings that create, or appear to create,\nconﬂicts of interest either for Home Bank or you are unacceptable. Home Bank recognizes your right\nto engage in private activities that are unrelated to our work. However, you must disclose any\npossible conﬂicts so that Home Bank may assess and prevent potential conﬂicts from arising. A\nconﬂict of interest occurs whenever you are in a position to inﬂuence a decision that may result in a\npersonal gain for yourself, a family member, or anyone else with whom you have a close personal\nrelationship. This may include making loans, waiving NSF fees or late charges, waiving document\nrequirements such as ﬁnancial statements, collateral documents or any other similar matter. **Outside Employment**\nIn general, outside work activities are not allowed if it:\n\n- Prevents the employee from fully performing the work for which they were employed byHome Bank, including overtime assignments. - Involves organizations that are doing or seek to do business with Home Bank, includingexisting or potential vendors. - Involves organizations that are in direct competition with Home Bank. - Violates provisions of law or Home Bank’s policies or procedures. **Acceptance of Gifts**\nYou should not accept entertainment, gifts, services, or other valuables from a third party seeking a\nﬁnancial relationship with Home Bank. Nominal items that are a mere token of the relationship and\nnot connected to or a suggestion of any business activity or transaction are acceptable (valued\nunder $200, cash is never acceptable), including Christmas gifts or awards from charitable\norganizations. Nominal items must be within your ability to reciprocate on a personal basis, or with\nlegitimate claim to Home Bank for reimbursement under similar circumstances. Although it is not possible to specify every action that might create a conﬂict of interest, this policy\nsets forth those which frequently present problems. If you have any question whether an action or\nproposed course of conduct would create a conﬂict of interest, you should immediately contact HR\nto obtain advice on the issue to avoid potentially engaging in an undisclosed conﬂict of interest. ---\n\n###### Code of Ethics\nEveryone at Home Bank is required to maintain a consistently high standard of business conduct,\nethics and social responsibility. It is imperative that we behave in a manner that inspires public trust\nand conﬁdence. Each of us must strive to avoid situations that might cause a conﬂict of interest\nbetween Home Bank, our customers, and ourselves. Our code of ethics provides guidelines that set\ngeneral directions for our conduct. We sincerely believe that the personal growth and development\nof our employees and our organization depend on continued demonstration of high levels of\nintegrity, ethics and social responsibility. In addition, the ﬁnancial institution business is regulated to such an extent that many actions\nconsidered unethical in another business may be illegal in our work environment. Criminal penalties\nas well as civil money penalties can be incurred for such violations. In the event you are in doubt\nabout whether some action would violate a law or regulation or this policy, you should ask your\nsupervisor or the Internal Audit Director beforehand. We believe that living up to our standards\nrequires a continuing exchange of ideas and opinions; therefore, management is available to assist\nyou when conﬂicts arise. Detailed policy information can be viewed on ONENET>Knowledge>Policies>Human\nResources>Code of Ethics. ###### Pay Transparency Nondiscrimination\nHome Bank will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants\nbecause they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another\nemployee or applicant.

Home Bank may review or change employee classiﬁcations at any time. **FLSA Status - Exempt vs. Nonexempt**\n\n- Exempt: Exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis and are not eligible to receive\novertime pay. - Nonexempt: Nonexempt employees are paid on an hourly basis and are eligible to receive\novertime pay for overtime hours worked. **Full-Time**\nIf you are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week and maintain continuous\nemployment status, you are considered to be full-time. Generally, as a full-time employee, you are\neligible for our full-time beneﬁts package and are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of\neach program. **Part-Time**\nIf you work a regular schedule of 10 hours or more but less than 30 hours per week, then you are\nconsidered part-time. As part-time, you may be eligible for some beneﬁts and are subject to the\nterms, condition and limitations for each program. Some part-time employees may also be classiﬁed\nas “seasonal” and work hours during holiday seasons and college breaks. **Temporary Employees.**\nIf you are hired for a speciﬁed project or time frame and may work an irregular schedule, you are\nconsidered temporary. Temporary employees are not eligible for beneﬁts provided by Home Bank,\nexcept those required by law, regardless of the number of hours worked. ###### We Are Invested in Your Career at Home Bank\nWe like to promote from within the organization. What does this mean to you? It means we\ndeveloped a job-posting program that allows you an easy way to apply for diﬀerent positions within\nHome Bank. All you need to do is watch ADP (Myself, Talent, Career Center) for postings. We do\nhave some guidelines around these promotions and job transfers though. You need the knowledge,\nskills, abilities and minimum qualiﬁcations required by that position and we recommend that you\nwork in your current position for approximately one year. ###### How Do I Access My Personnel File? Personnel ﬁles are maintained by HR and are considered conﬁdential. Managers and supervisors\nmay only have access to personnel ﬁle information on a need-to-know basis. If you wish to review\nyour personnel ﬁle, please contact the Human Resource Department. Employee ﬁles may not be\ntaken outside of the department. Certain documents may not be eligible for review. Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources are limited. However, we must comply with\ncertain requests, including but not limited to subpoenas from authorized law enforcement agencies,\nor local, state, or federal courts or agencies conducting litigation, oﬃcial investigations or audits. ---\n\nHome Bank takes seriously its duty to protect the conﬁdential information it maintains on employees,\nsuch as social security numbers, dates of birth, direct deposit banking information, and all medical\ninformation. In addition to its own rigorous policies to protect this information, Home Bank complies\nwith all legal obligations concerning the use and storage of this information. **Important Note**\nWe need your help making sure your information is up to date in our ﬁles. If you have a life-changing\nevent, log into ADP and update your record. This could include something as simple as changing\nphones to having a child. ###### Payment of Wages & Overtime\nHome Bank’s pay period for all employees is biweekly and will be paid every other Friday. If payday\nfalls on a federal holiday, you will receive your paycheck one workday prior to the holiday. You will be paid through direct deposit to either a savings or checking account at Home Bank or at a\nbank of your choosing. You are required to activate direct deposit through ADP prior to your ﬁrst\npaycheck. You can view your detailed pay information including gross pay, statutory deductions, and\nvoluntary deductions through ADP. In the event of an error in funds deposited, or if there are any\nother discrepancies, HR must be notiﬁed immediately. You are responsible for conﬁrming your\npaycheck funds are in your bank account prior to using them. Due to the needs of the business, occasionally you may be required to work overtime. Overtime is\nactual hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0006", "char_span": [28798, 33339], "sentence_count": 40, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0005", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0007", "keywords": ["your", "home", "bank", "hours", "overtime"], "policy_tags": ["FLSA", "OVERTIME"], "hash_64": "28cdb9d653206e29", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.390546", "token_count": 1021}}
{"text": "You are responsible for conﬁrming your\npaycheck funds are in your bank account prior to using them. Due to the needs of the business, occasionally you may be required to work overtime. Overtime is\nactual hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. Nonexempt employees will be paid time and\none-half their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40. Paid leave such as holiday,\nPTO, bereavement time, sick, extended leave and jury duty do not apply towards hours worked. All\novertime must be approved by your immediate supervisor. Any unapproved overtime hours worked,\nmay result in disciplinary action up to possible termination. Pursuant to wage and hour laws,\nnonexempt employees must be paid for all hours worked and may not “bank” time oﬀ in lieu of\nreceiving overtime pay. Business needs may require employees to work on a holiday. Should this be the case Home Bank\nwill pay time and one-half for working on a holiday or will allow the employee to take another day oﬀ\nwithin the calendar year following the scheduled holiday. ###### Time Records\nWhether you are an exempt or nonexempt employee, you are required to record hours in ADP. Nonexempt employees will use the timeclock and the Time Oﬀ Request feature in ADP, while\nExempt employees will use the Time Oﬀ Request feature. These records may be required by\ngovernmental regulations and are used to calculate regular and overtime pay when applicable. If you\nforget a time punch, you must immediately notify your supervisor in order to correct your time. Under no circumstances are you allowed to clock in or out for another employee or clock yourself\nout and continue working. You are also not allowed to use the ADP phone app to clock in/out unless\nspeciﬁcally approved by HR. In addition, clocking in/out for work should always be on a work\ncomputer, never on a mobile device. ---\n\nPaid time oﬀ, tardiness, absences and early departures must be recorded on the ADP time system\nand approved by your supervisor. Managers are required to review and approve employee time in\nADP. Any violations of these guidelines may be subject to disciplinary action including termination. While all hours worked will be compensated appropriately, an employee’s failure to report hours\naccurately in ADP, whether too low or too high, may result in disciplinary action. Nonexempt employees are NOT permitted to work “oﬀ the clock,” which includes after-hours\ncompany email or cell usage on a personal device. No supervisor or manager shall participate in,\nencourage or even permit a nonexempt employee to work oﬀ the clock in violation of this policy. Employees should immediately report any violation of this policy to HR. ###### Work Hours & Breaks\nWork hours are established by each department manager based on Home Bank and customer\nneeds. Generally, you are permitted one hour unpaid meal break each day. However, staﬃng and\ncoverage concerns may require you to limit your break to 30 minutes. If a nonexempt employee is\nrequired to work through a meal break, they will be paid for the time period. You may also be\nallowed up to two 10-minute rest periods each day, but know that all breaks should be approved\nand scheduled by your manager to ensure proper coverage in the facility. During any unpaid break period, nonexempt employees are not permitted to perform any work for\nor on behalf of Home Bank. Generally, employees may not combine break periods or shorten or skip their meal break to oﬀset a\nlate arrival or early departure. Occasional exceptions may be made with manager approval. **Lactation Breaks**\nIn accordance with applicable law, Home Bank will provide reasonable break time for an employee\nto express breast milk for their nursing child for the period of time prescribed in applicable law. Employees should check with their supervisor for speciﬁc information, including the location where\nthe break may occur and how to account for the break time. ###### Payroll Deductions & Corrections\nThe government requires us to make certain deductions from employee paychecks. These include\nthe Federal Income Tax (FIT), Federal Social Security (FICA), Medicare Tax, and State Income Tax\n(SIT). Other deductions may be made when required to comply with a court order, such as child\nsupport. The amount of these deductions is summarized on your paystub in ADP and your W-2.

To help us verify our payroll accuracy, you are expected to review each paycheck carefully,\nand immediately report suspected errors to HR. If we discover that you have been overpaid, we reserve the right to make appropriate payroll\ndeductions or make arrangements for repayment of the overage. If you leave before the overage is\nrepaid, the balance due may be deducted from your ﬁnal paycheck to the extent permitted by law. **Deductions in Salary for Exempt Employees**\nExempt employees are paid on a salary basis and are generally paid their full salary for any week in\nwhich they perform work. However, their salary may be reduced at the discretion of Home Bank in\nthe following circumstances:\n\n- Employees who are absent for at least a full day because of sickness, disability, or personalreasons may not be paid for that day unless they have accrued beneﬁts under the Bank’s paid\nleave policies. Their pay will not be reduced if they are absent for less than a full day for these\nreasons, but an employee’s leave balance may be reduced by the amount of time the employee is\nabsent from work, even if the time absent is less than a full day. - Employees who are absent from work for jury duty, attendance as a witness at a trial, or temporarymilitary leave may have their pay reduced by the amount of payment they receive in the form of\njury fees, witness fees, or military pay. Their pay will not be reduced by the number of hours or\ndays they are absent from work unless they perform no work in a given week. - Employees may be suspended without pay if they are found to have violated one of the Bank’spolicies regarding proper workplace conduct, but only in full-day increments. - Employees who work less than a full week during their ﬁrst or last week of employment will be paida proportionate part of their salary for the time actually worked. - Actual time taken oﬀ for Family and Medical Leave (FMLA). ###### Complaints or Questions Regarding Wages or Deductions\nAny employee who believes that amounts have been wrongfully deducted or withheld from his/her\npay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal, state, or local law should report\nthe deduction to HR. In addition, employees are required to immediately notify HR in the event they believe they have\nbeen improperly classiﬁed as exempt from the FLSA requirements, have not properly recorded all\ntime worked, have not been properly paid wages or overtime due to them, or if there is a mistake in\ntheir paycheck or any expense reimbursement, regardless of whether the mistake is to the beneﬁt of\nthe employee or Home Bank. Home Bank prohibits retaliation or reprisal against any employee, who in good-faith, raises\nquestions or concerns regarding their pay. ---\n\n# Our Investment\n\n---\n\n```shell\n# Our Investment\n# in You\n# Our Investment in You\n```\n\nAs an employee of Home Bank, you may become eligible for a variety of beneﬁt programs designed\nto assist you and your eligible dependents in meeting the ﬁnancial burdens that can result from\nillness and disability and to help you plan for retirement.

PTO requests must be submitted through ADP and subject to approval by management. Home Bank\nwill try to accommodate PTO requests; however, all PTO requests are subject to availability and\nstaﬃng needs. In an eﬀort to accommodate the desires of our employees who would like to take\nPTO earlier in the year, employees may be permitted to borrow against the PTO they expect to\naccrue over the course of the calendar year. However, if your employment with Home Bank is\nterminated for any reason prior to the time that you have accumulated the number of PTO days\ntaken during that calendar year, you are responsible for reimbursing Home Bank for the amount of\nused but unaccrued PTO. A deduction will be processed for employees who have a negative PTO as\nof 12/31, annually. These deductions will be made on the ﬁnal payroll, for terminated employees, and\non the last payroll of the year for active employees. Unused PTO at year-end will be forfeited, unless prohibited by state law. Upon termination, all PTO\naccrued as of the previous January 1, and not yet taken will be payable with the employee’s ﬁnal\npaycheck. ###### Holidays\nHolidays are selected by Home Bank annually and usually follow the federal holiday schedule. Home Bank may also close locations early or otherwise for various occasions. You can view holiday\nupdates on ONENET>Bank Calendar. All full-time employees will receive their regular rate of pay for approved holidays (not to exceed hours). A holiday will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime. Part-time employees who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible to receive holiday pay if\nthat holiday falls on their regularly scheduled day (for example, Sally works 5 hours a day on\nMonday, Wednesday and Fridays. Labor Day is scheduled on a Monday, so that means Sally will\nreceive 5 hours of holiday pay.)\n\nPTO or Time Oﬀ Awards on the day before and/or after a bank paid holiday should always be\nscheduled in advance and is subject to management approval. If an employee calls in sick and/or\nschedules it as a sick day, a doctor’s note may be required in order to utilize any available sick time. If an employee calls in for personal reasons (not sick and not pre-approved), then any available\naccrued PTO or Time Oﬀ Award would be used, and the employee would be subject to disciplinary\naction.

Upon receipt of the notice to\nserve jury duty, you should immediately provide a copy of your summons to your supervisor. ###### Military Leave\nHome Bank supports the military obligations of all employees and grants leaves for uniformed\nservice in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. Any employee who needs time oﬀ for\nuniformed service should immediately notify HR and their supervisor. If an employee is unable to\nprovide notice before leaving for uniformed service, a family member should notify the supervisor as\nsoon as possible. Upon return from military leave, you will be granted the same seniority, pay, and beneﬁts as if you\nhad worked continuously. Failure to report for work within the prescribed time after completion of\nmilitary service will be considered a voluntary resignation from Home Bank. All employees who enter military service may accumulate a total absence of ﬁve years and still retain\nemployment rights. Employees should also refer to the Leave under the Family and Medical Leave\nAct for further rights and responsibilities regarding military leave. ###### Family & Medical Leave (FMLA)\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees the opportunity to\ntake unpaid, job-protected leave for certain speciﬁed reasons. The maximum amount of leave an\nemployee may use is either 12 or 26 weeks within a 12-month period, depending on the reasons for\nthe leave. To be eligible for family/medical leave, you must have worked for the bank for at least 12 months and\nfor at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before leave is to begin. Additionally, you must work in a\nlocation where there are at least 50 employees within 75 miles of that location. *Acorns grow into massive oak trees. Though we start out small, let’s*\n*remain rooted in humility together as we grow into our full potential.*\n\nAdditional bereavement time oﬀ or time oﬀ for other family relationships, may be requested through\nHuman Resources and the request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Home Bank understands\nthat circumstances vary in times of grief and will work with employees seeking additional time oﬀ,\nwhich may include requesting personal leave of absence. ---\n\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:\n\n- birth of a child, or to care for a newly-born child (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- to care for an immediate family member (employee’s spouse, child, or parent) with a serious healthcondition (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- because of the employee’s serious health condition that makes the employee unable to performthe employee’s job (up to 12 weeks);\n\n- to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness related to certain types ofmilitary service (up to 26 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or\n\n- to handle certain qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son,daughter, or parent is on duty under a call or order to active duty in the Uniformed Services (up to\n12 weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details). The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in a 12-month period for all reasons combined is weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a covered service member, the maximum combined\nleave entitlement is 26 weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those\n26 weeks. Note that in cases where the Bank employs spouses, the spouses are limited to a combined total of\n12 weeks of FMLA due to the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child or to care for a\nparent with a serious health condition. Additional parameters apply for spouses who work for the\nBank, so these employees should work with Human Resources to determine exactly how much time\neach spouse is eligible for under FMLA, depending on the circumstances of the leave. **Deﬁnitions**\nA *serious health condition* is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that\ninvolves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care\nprovider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the\nemployee’s job, or prevents the qualiﬁed family member from participating in school or other daily\nactivities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement includes an incapacity\nof more than three full calendar days and two visits to a health care provider or one visit to a health\ncare provider and a continuing regimen of care; an incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal\nvisits, a chronic condition, or permanent or long-term conditions; or absences due to multiple\ntreatments.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0012", "char_span": [54861, 59684], "sentence_count": 23, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0011", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0013", "keywords": ["leave", "care", "employees", "that", "service"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "PTO"], "hash_64": "29c599474b336671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.417922", "token_count": 1027}}
{"text": "Other situations may meet the deﬁnition of continuing treatment. A *covered service member* is a customer or veteran of the Armed Forces, including the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in\noutpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. The term *serious injury or illness* means an injury or illness incurred by the customer in the line of\nduty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the customer medically unﬁt to\nperform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating or one that existed before the\nbeginning of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty. With\nregard to veterans, the injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed\nveteran status. ---\n\n*Qualifying exigencies* include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging\nalternative childcare, making ﬁnancial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and\nrecuperation, counseling, and post-deployment debrieﬁngs. **Identifying the 12-Month Period**\nThe 12-month period in which 12 weeks of leave may be taken is a rolling 12-month period measured\nbackward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA leave for the birth or placement\nof a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12 months of the birth or placement. **Using Leave**\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks\nof time), or by reducing the normal work schedule when medically necessary for the serious health\ncondition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a covered service member,\ntheir injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for\nmilitary qualifying exigencies. Intermittent leave is not permitted for the birth of a child, to care for a\nnewly born child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Employees who require\nintermittent or reduced-schedule leave must try to schedule their leave so that it will not unduly\ndisrupt the Bank's operations. **Use of Accrued Paid Leave**\nTo the extent you have any accrued PTO and/or sick time, you are required to use it concurrently\nwith your FMLA leave. Beneﬁts received under other income replacement programs, such as disability or workers’ compensation also run concurrently with FMLA and do not extend the period of\nFMLA. However, employees may be able to supplement these paid beneﬁts with available vacation\nand/or sick, to a maximum of 100% of their regular base pay for the week. **Maintenance of Health Beneﬁts**\nIf you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, the Bank will maintain coverage during\nyour FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. You must make arrangements\nto pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave prior to beginning leave, unless the need\nfor leave in unforeseeable, in which case you must make arrangements as soon as possible. In some\ninstances, the Bank may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other beneﬁts for\nyou and your family. **Notice and Medical Certiﬁcation**\nWhen seeking FMLA leave, you are required to provide:\n\n- suﬃcient information and documentation for us to determine if the requested leave qualiﬁes forFMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. You must also inform the\nbank if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certiﬁed;\n\n- if the need for leave is foreseeable, this information must be provided 30 days in advance of theanticipated beginning date of the leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, this information\nmust be provided as soon as is practicable and in compliance with the bank’s normal call-in\nprocedures, absent unusual circumstances;\n\n---\n\n- periodic reports as deemed appropriate by the bank during the leave regarding your status andintent to return to work; and\n\n- medical certiﬁcation of ﬁtness for duty before returning to work, if the leave was due to your serioushealth condition. The bank will require this certiﬁcation to address whether you can perform the\nessential functions of your position.

{"text": "Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. **Employer Responsibilities**\nTo the extent required by law, the bank will inform employees whether they are eligible under FMLA. Should an employee be eligible for FMLA, the bank will provide them with a notice that speciﬁes any\nadditional information required as well as the employee’s rights and responsibilities. If employees are\nnot eligible, the bank will provide a reason for the ineligibility. The bank will also inform employees if\nleave will be designated as FMLA and, to the extent possible, note the amount of leave counted\nagainst the employee’s leave entitlement. If the bank determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected,\nthe bank will notify the employee. **Job Restoration**\nUpon returning from FMLA leave, eligible employees will typically be restored to their original job or to\nan equivalent job with equivalent pay, beneﬁts, and other employment terms and conditions. **Exemption for Key Employees**\nCertain key employees may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if\ndoing so would cause substantial economic injury to the bank. Key employees are salaried and among\nthe highest paid 10 percent of all employees. The bank will notify you if you qualify as a key employee\nand if the bank intends to deny reinstatement and your rights in such instances. **Failure to Return After FMLA Leave**\nAny employee who fails to return to work as scheduled after FMLA leave or exceeds the 12-week\nFMLA entitlement (or in the case of military caregiver leave, the 26-week FMLA entitlement), will be\nsubject to the bank’s standard leave of absence and attendance policies. This will result in\ntermination if you have no other bank-provided or legally mandated leave available to you that applies\nto your continued absence. Likewise, following the conclusion of your FMLA leave, the bank’s\nobligation to maintain your group health plan beneﬁts ends (subject to any applicable COBRA rights). **Fraud**\nProviding false or misleading information or omitting material information in connection with an FMLA\nleave will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. **Employers’ Compliance with FMLA and Employee’s Enforcement Rights**\nFMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA, or discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice\nmade unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. While the Bank encourages employees to bring any concerns or complaints about compliance with\nFMLA to the attention of management, FMLA regulations require employers to advise employees that\nthey may ﬁle a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or bring a private lawsuit against an\nemployer. ---\n\nFurther, FMLA does not aﬀect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, nor does it\nsupersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or\nmedical leave rights. **Limited Nature of This Policy**\nThis policy should not be construed to confer any express or implied contractual relationship or\nrights to any employee not expressly provided for by FMLA. The Bank reserves the right to modify\nthis or any other policy as necessary, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law. State or\nlocal leave laws may also apply. **Military-Related Federal FMLA Leave**\nFMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related\nmedical and nonmedical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The ﬁrst is\nMilitary Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is\ndetailed below. **Military Caregiver Leave**\nUnpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family\nmembers who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty. The family member must be a “covered service member,” which means: (1) a current customer or\nveteran of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Reserves, (2) who is undergoing medical treatment,\nrecuperation, or therapy; or, in the case of a veteran, who was a current customer of the Armed\nForces, National Guard or Reserves within ﬁve years prior to the treatment for which an eligible\nemployee requests leave; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, (3) for a serious injury or illness that may render a current customer medically unﬁt to\nperform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating.

Military Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each service member. Consequently, an\neligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every covered service\nmember, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same covered service member.

For example, during the *single 12-month period* , an eligible employee may\ntake up to 16 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered service member when combined with up to\n10 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. An employee seeking Military Caregiver Leave may be required to provide appropriate certiﬁcation\nfrom the employee and/or covered service member and completed by an authorized health care\nprovider within 15 days. Military Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in this FMLA policy (requirements\nregarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice, use of accrued paid leave, etc.). Military Caregiver\nLeave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations,\nand nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations. **Qualifying Exigency Leave**\nEligible employees may take unpaid *Qualifying Exigency Leave* to tend to certain *exigencies* arising\nout of the duty under a call or order to active duty of a *covered military customer* (i.e., the\nemployee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent). Up to 12 weeks of Qualifying Exigency Leave is\navailable in any 12-month period, as measured by the same method that governs measurement of\nother forms of FMLA leave within this FMLA policy (with the exception of Military Caregiver Leave,\nwhich is subject to a maximum of 26 weeks of leave in a *single 12-month period* ).

An employee who is still disabled\nafter 90 calendar days may be eligible for long-term disability beneﬁts. Please refer to the section on\nand summary plan description for Long-term Disability beneﬁts. After ﬁve weeks, if medically necessary, an employee can use accrued PTO, sick or extended leave\nup until the 90th calendar day in order to stay in a paid status. Employees can also use accrued PTO,\nsick or extended leave to cover the 20% of unpaid time. ###### Long-Term Disability\nHome Bank oﬀers all full-time employees working at least 40 hours per week a Long-term Disability\n(LTD) insurance plan at no cost to the employee. This plan provides monthly LTD beneﬁts equal to\n60% of basic monthly earnings up to a maximum beneﬁt of $5,000 per month. Employees are\neligible for this coverage on the ﬁrst of the month following date of hire. Beneﬁts under the Long-Term Disability Plan are determined at the sole discretion of the insurance\ncarrier. For speciﬁc information concerning limitations and beneﬁt details, you should refer to your\nLong-Term Disability summary plan document. ---\n\n###### Leaves of Absence (Non-FMLA)\nWe recognize that employees may need to request a leave of absence for medical, family, or\npersonal reasons when they are not eligible for a federal or state-speciﬁc leave right, or another\nHome Bank leave policy. During any leave, an employee will be required to use any earned time oﬀ beneﬁts before taking the\ntime as unpaid, unless the employee’s leave is covered under another income replacement beneﬁt,\nsuch as workers’ compensation. In these cases, to the extent the income replacement beneﬁts\npermit, the employee may use earned but unused time oﬀ beneﬁts to supplement these other\npayments, as long as the employee’s total wages for the week do not exceed 100% of the\nemployee’s regular base rate of pay. Leaves fall into one of three categories:\n\n- Medical leave is for any illness or injury of the employee, including pregnancy and childbirth. - Family leave includes caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or caring for an immediatefamily member with a serious illness or injury. For purposes of this policy, immediate family members\nare deﬁned as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner, child, or parent. - Personal leave is for all other requests not included under medical or family leave or other Bank,federal, or state leave law and is granted under limited circumstances at the sole discretion of Home\nBank’s management, based on various factors, including the general performance record of the\nemployee and the operating needs of the Bank. If the leave is for a medical or family related reason, the leave will be considered in accordance with\nany legal requirements in addition to this policy. To the extent permitted by law, the need for more\nthan one type of leave may be combined, and leaves will run concurrently with any other leaves.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md", "company": "Home Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Home Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0017", "char_span": [78422, 82798], "sentence_count": 24, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0016", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Home_Bank.md_chunk_0018", "keywords": ["leave", "beneﬁts", "disability", "home", "bank"], "policy_tags": ["FMLA", "PTO"], "hash_64": "3fcda84747226863", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.441048", "token_count": 1006}}

To the extent permitted by law, the need for more\nthan one type of leave may be combined, and leaves will run concurrently with any other leaves. Employees must provide their supervisor and Human Resources notice of the need for leave as far\nin advance as is practicable. Requests must include documented proof of the need for leave, the\ndate leave is to begin and the expected date of return. Leave requests for the employee’s or an\nimmediate family member’s illness or injury must accompany a physician’s documentation and\nstatement supporting the need for leave. Depending on the nature of the leaves, additional\ndocumentation may be required. When leave is due to the employee’s own illness or injury, Home Bank reserves the right to have the\nemployee examined by a physician of the Bank’s choosing and at the Bank’s expense to support the\nneed for leave. Employees may also be required to provide periodic physician documentation during\ntheir leave to support the need for continued leave in addition to a physician’s certiﬁcation\npermitting them to return to work at the completion of the leave period. Employees may also be\nrequired to maintain contact with their supervisor during a leave at designated intervals about their\nstatus and tentative return to work plans. While on leave, Home Bank will pay for its portion of the employee’s insurance premiums for the\nlength of time of approved leave. The employee is required to make payment arrangements with the\nBank for their portion. Continuation of beneﬁts beyond this period is at the employee’s expense\nthrough COBRA. Time oﬀ beneﬁts and any other Bank sponsored beneﬁts do not accrue during\nunpaid leaves. ---\n\nWe recognize that circumstances may occasionally prevent an employee from returning to work as\nplanned. These situations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the law, to\ndetermine if approval of additional leave time can be granted. We will attempt to reinstate employees returning from a leave to their same or similar position;\nhowever, depending on the nature and length of the leave, there may not be a guarantee that we\nwill be able to return an employee to any position upon completion of their leave. In making these\ndecisions, Home Bank complies with all applicable laws regarding reinstatement. Employees who fail to return to work the day after an approved leave ends will be deemed to have\nvoluntarily resigned from their employment. For complete information about leaves of absence, please contact Human Resources. ###### Additional Leaves\n###### The leave rights outlined in this handbook are applicable to all employees, provided they meet\n###### the eligibility requirements for a particular leave (which may include the requirement that the\n###### employee be full-time). States, however, may have additional leave protections that certain\n###### employees may be entitled to receive. If you have the need for time oﬀ that is not covered under\n###### a policy listed in this Handbook, please discuss your need with Human Resources so that we can\n###### determine if your request is protected under any additional state law. General examples include\n###### state-speciﬁc family, medical, and/or military leave rights. ###### Please note that unless speciﬁcally prohibited by law, when an employee’s need for leave is\n###### covered under more than one leave law, leave time under the laws runs concurrently. ###### Accrual of PTO During Leave\n###### Home Bank awards accrual time based on time worked; therefore, when an employee is out on\n###### any approved leave of absence (Short Term Disability, Workers’ Compensation or any other\n###### approved leave), the accrual of PTO time will cease. PTO accruals will continue upon return from\n###### leave. *The hearts represent the connection and bonds we form*\n*as a team.
