Page 6 of 42\n\n---\n\n## Page 7\n\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook\n\nThis commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including\nselection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,\nand termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all\nclassifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment. If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or\nprocess that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your\ndepartment manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources. You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal\nemployment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your\ncomplaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be\nengaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up\nto and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES\nOur Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting\ndiscrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any\nqualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such\nindividual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential\nfunctions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a\nqualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us\naware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her\nposition. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue\nhardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate\ndisclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the\nconfidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information\nis subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at\nmanagement’s discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the\nessential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This\npolicy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions\nnecessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws.

You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal\nemployment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your\ncomplaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be\nengaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up\nto and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES\n\nOur Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting\ndiscrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any\nqualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such\nindividual's disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential\nfunctions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a\nqualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us\naware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her\nposition. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue\nhardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file. The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate\ndisclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the\nconfidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information\nis subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at\nmanagement's discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the\nessential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This\npolicy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions\nnecessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws.

EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY\nSTANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nIt is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect\nthat all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate\nintegrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of\nconduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the\nsafety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive\ndiscipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all\npossible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of\nbehavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship. For more information, contact your\nmanager or a human resources business partner. Rudeness to a customer\nAs a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely\ncommitted to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a\nconsiderate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe\nyou are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to\ntreat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be\ntolerated. Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift\nWhen you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are\nexpected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption\ncaused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in\nadvance of your shift as possible. Failure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is\ninexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action. If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your\nsupervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment. Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or\nmanager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of\nabsence or disciplinary suspension.

{"text": "IV. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nSTANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nIt is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect\nthat all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate\nintegrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of\nconduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the\nsafety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive\ndiscipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all\npossible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of\nbehavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship. For more information, contact your\nmanager or a human resources business partner. Rudeness to a customer\n\nAs a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely\ncommitted to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a\nconsiderate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe\nyou are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to\ntreat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be\ntolerated. Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift\n\nWhen you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are\nexpected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption\ncaused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in\nadvance of your shift as possible. Failure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is\ninexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action. If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your\nsupervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment. Job abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or\nmanager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of\nabsence or disciplinary suspension.

Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be\nconsumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be\nvisible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and\nprosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible. Failure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not\nworked is considered theft and could cost you your job.

Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to\naccurately report all time spent performing any and all work.

This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee\nallowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,\nincluding inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants.

Employees\nwho violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for\nassistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked\nto submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of\nalcohol.

In rare cases we\nmay allow this, but you must have prior approval from both your supervisor or manager and human\nresources. If you engage in other work or employment during your leave without prior approval from\nyour supervisor or manager and human resources, you will be considered to have violated the terms of\nyour leave and to have voluntarily terminated your employment.

MEDICAL LEAVE\nA medical leave of absence will be granted to employees who are restricted from working due to a\ndisabling illness or injury upon receipt of sufficient information from a medical provider that verifies the\ndisabling condition and the need for medical leave.

Page 23 of 42\n\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook\n\nAn employee is required to provide the Company and The Hartford with notice of the need for FML 30\ncalendar days in advance, or as soon as is practical. During an FML, the Company continues to pay the employer’s portion of your medical, dental and life\ninsurance benefits. Retirement contributions are suspended during an FML, as are all other benefits\nsuch as vacation, PTO and holidays. Your union contract or the LFHI non-union benefits summary will\nprovide further information regarding the impact of FML on vacation, holidays, personal holidays, and\nPTO benefits. In addition, you will be able to substitute earned paid leave during the unpaid portion of\nyour FML leave. The Hartford will require a physician’s statement certifying the reason for the FML request and may\nrequire periodic updates throughout the leave period. The Hartford may require recertification on a\nreasonable basis in compliance with the law. If The Hartford has reason to doubt the validity of the\ncertification, it may require, at the Company’s expense, that a second opinion be obtained from a health\ncare provider of its choosing. If the second opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification,\nthen The Hartford may require, at the Company’s expense, that you obtain the opinion of a third health\ncare provider designated or approved jointly by you and the Company. The opinion of the third health\ncare provider shall be final and binding. At the end of your FML, the Company will restore you to the position you held before your leave started\nor to an equivalent position, except as provided under applicable law. In addition, while you are on FML,\nThe Hartford and the Company may require you to periodically report on your status and intention to\nreturn to work. Typically, when you are on FML, you may not engage in other work or employment. In rare cases we\nmay allow this, but you must have prior approval from both your supervisor or manager and human\nresources. If you engage in other work or employment during your leave without prior approval from\nyour supervisor or manager and human resources, you will be considered to have violated the terms of\nyour leave and to have voluntarily terminated your employment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md", "company": "Lunds Byerlys", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Lunds Byerlys", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0028", "char_span": [139049, 144133], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0027", "next_chunk_id": "Retail_Lunds___Byerlys.md_chunk_0029", "keywords": ["your", "will", "leave", "hartford", "opinion"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "PTO", "REST"], "hash_64": "398bb94747216a79", "created_at": "2025-11-19T13:28:07.813770", "token_count": 996}}
