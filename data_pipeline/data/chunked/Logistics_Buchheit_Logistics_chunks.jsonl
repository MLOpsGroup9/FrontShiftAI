A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to\nmake it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself\nhave taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today. I would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the\ndepression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant\nloading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education\nduring these times.

In this policy, Buchheit is establishing the framework within which\nwe operate. These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further\nclarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the\nCompany President or the Chief Executive Officer. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision\nthat may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with\nBuchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or\nmarriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood\nor marriage. There is no \"presumption of guilt\" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.

The phones are provided to\nassist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other\nbusiness-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,\nbrief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit\nissued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality. Company provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the\nteam member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for\nreplacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being\neligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility\nwindow, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also\nresponsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services. Buchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list\naccessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded\napplications to company provided cell phones. While driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that\nreason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You\nshould utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or\ntalk on the phone. If you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your\nconversations private and non-disruptive to others. The use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited. Personal Identifiable Information Policy (PID)\n\nIt is company policy to protect personally identifiable information (PII) of employees and contractors. The electronic restrictions and safeguards outlined in this policy provide guidance for employees, and\ncontractors that have access to PII to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. Personal Identifiable Information (PID) is defined as: Any representation of information that permits\nthe identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or\nindirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual (e.g.,\nname, address, social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email\naddress, etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other\ndata elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender,\nrace, birth date, geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the\nphysical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable information. This information can be maintained in either paper, electronic or other media. 39|P age\n\n---\n\n## Page 41\n\nSome information that is considered PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, public\nwebsites, university listings, etc. This type of information is considered to be Public PII and includes:\n 1.

To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for\nteam members, customers, and visitors, Buchheit has established a workplace safety program. The Loss\nPrevention Department is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety\nprogram. The success of the program depends on the alertness and personal commitment of everyone. We provide information to team members about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal\ncommunication channels. These may include supervisor-team member meetings, bulletin board postings,\nmemos, or other written communications. Team members and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential\nsafety and health hazards, as well as safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards.

Regular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be\n eligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the\n preceding two calendar years. The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a \"calendar year\". A \" calendar year\" is defined as\n the 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended\n for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the\n benefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information. Once you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the\n schedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued. You may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should\n request the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will\n be reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements. Different departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations\n are granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may\n apply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence. Vacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation.

When unpaid time\noff is requested for personal reasons, a team member’s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid\ntime off can be requested. Unpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number\nof consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than\nthree (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave\nof absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence. Team members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as\nthe benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit\nRetirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and\nemployer contributions to the plan. Team members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)\nweeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to\nproperly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be\nwaived in emergency situations. Facility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and\ncommunicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks\nprior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing\nand budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar\nyear.

The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to\nproperly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs.
