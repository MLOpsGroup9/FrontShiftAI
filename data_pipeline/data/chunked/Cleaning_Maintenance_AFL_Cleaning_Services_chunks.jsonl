This\ncommunication should include a clear understanding of expectations for work results, periodic reviews of progress towards these\nresults, and counseling, re-training or assistance when necessary. MAJOR ACTIVITIES IN PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REVIEW\nThere are three major activities in the Performance Management and Review Process. 1. A Valid Job Description\n The fundamental component of the performance is the job description. This document identifies the skills,\n competencies, experiences and training details suggested and/or required for a particular job. It is in the best interest\n of both the employee and the company to ensure a current (not less than 3 years old) job description exists. Management and employee should review the job description upon being hired and review at regular interval to\n ensure a high level of accuracy exists and desired results are being accomplished. 2. Performance Evaluation Process\n The client evaluates the employee job performance on a regular (weekly or monthly) basis using the Customer Quality Card\n provided by the company. As stated on the card, a code or rating of 3 or below is unacceptable. With such rating, the employee\n will undergo additional training and if deemed necessary, terminated. 3. Development Opportunities. The Company will provide periodic skills training to the employees for the purpose of continuous development and on-going\n growth, based on the organizations mission and values. TRAINING:\n\nPOLICY\nIt is the policy of the Company to provide initial on-the-job training and ongoing development opportunities to employees, to ensure\nthat all employees continually grow in their work-related skills and abilities. It is the policy of the Company to provide both\ndocumented and face-to-face feedback to employees on their skills on a periodic basis.
