In the\nevent that a relative of an employee is hired, the Company may:\n - Limit the supervisory/subordinate relationships of the relatives;\n - Limit the situations whereby one checks or verifies the work of the other; and\n - May limit the situations in which a conflict of interest is likely to exist;\n\nThe intent of these guidelines is to protect the Company and rights of other employees, not to put a\npotential employee at a disadvantage due to his or her relationship with a current employee. When\nappropriate, the Company may determine if alternative methods of organizing work are to be\nconsidered to avoid disqualifying qualified candidates who are related to current employees. In the event that two existing employees become related while employed, the Company also\nreserves the right to alter job assignments to minimize the impact of the reporting relationship. In\nextreme cases termination may be necessary. ---\n\n## Page 14\n\n1.22 FORMS AND POLICIES\n\n---\n\n## Page 15\n\nTSHEETS & GPS TIME TRACKING (TIME KEEPING)\n\n Reasons for implementation for employees & employer\n a.

Below are a few examples of some of the most\ncommon circumstances under which employment is terminated:\n\n Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee. Termination - involuntary employment termination initiated by the Company. Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the Company for nondisciplinary reasons. When an employee intends to terminate his/her employment with TNT Construction/Kerkhoff,\nInc., he or she must notify office personnel. Upon voluntary termination of employment the\nCompany requests two weeks’ notice to help with scheduling issues. Since employment with TNT Construction/Kerkhoff, Inc. is based on mutual consent, both the\nemployee and TNT Construction/Kerkhoff, Inc. have the right to terminate employment at will,\nwith or without cause during both the Introductory/Probationary Period for New Employees (See\nSection 1.12, Probationary Period for New Employees), and during an employee’s continued\nemployment with the Company after such introductory/probationary period. Any employee who terminates employment with TNT Construction/Kerkhoff, Inc. shall return all\nfiles, records, keys, and any other materials that are property of the Company. No final settlement\nof an employee’s pay will be made until all items are returned in appropriate condition. The cost\nof replacing non-returned items will be deducted from the employee’s final paycheck. Furthermore, any outstanding financial obligations owed to the Company will also be deducted\nfrom the employee’s final check. Employee’s benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. All\naccrued vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid. Some benefits may\nbe continued at the employee’s expense (See Section 3, Benefits) if the employee elects to do so. The employee will be notified of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions,\nand limitations. 4.2 REQUESTS OF LEAVE\n\n MEDICAL/SICK DAYS\nThe Company’s employees are required to call the office or Jill’s cell phone to report a sick day at\nthe earliest possible time as not to disrupt operations of the Company. The Company reserves the right to request an explanatory note from the employee's physician\nshould an absence extend beyond three (3) consecutive working days due to a non-job-related\nillness or injury. If you do not report for work and the office is not notified of your status, it will be\nassumed after three consecutive days of absence that you have resigned, and you will be removed\nfrom the payroll. ---\n\n## Page 27\n\nAbsence due to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions will be treated the same as\nany other non-pregnancy-related illness or disability. When an employee is absent from work for more than three (3) consecutive working days,\nmanagement will review the situation to determine if there is a need to fill the position. If you become ill while at work or must leave for some other reason before the end of the\nworkday, be sure to inform the office or your supervisor.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA)\nThe leave of absence is defined as a leave from your job without pay. A leave of absence will only\nbe considered in special circumstances. The leave of absence policy of TNT\nConstruction/Kerkhoff, Inc. exists in order to protect the longevity of employees who must take a\nleave of absence for themselves for acceptable reasons for temporary periods. Any request for a leave of absence must be submitted in writing for the period of time and must be\napproved by the Company in advance of the commencement of the leave. Management may recommend either approval or denial of a leave of absence request based upon\nbusiness considerations and/or circumstances of the request, (e.g., staffing needs, employee\ndisability, military obligations, family crisis, unusual circumstances, etc.). If the time period requested is longer than the position can be held open, then the employee will be\nadvised at that time that the job may not be available upon the employee's return to work. The employee is responsible for the payment of all insurance premiums for his/her\n individual coverage and dependent health insurance coverage (if applicable). This money\n should be paid to TNT Construction\\Kerkhoff Inc. by the first day of each month which\n the employee is on an approved leave of absence. The employee will retain his/her original employment date (continuous service or\n anniversary date) showing no interruption in service.

The Company holds each of its employees to abide by certain work rules of general conduct and\nperformance at all times. The regulations governing employee conduct and responsibilities have\nbeen established in the best interest of the company, its employees, and its customers. The usual sequence of corrective actions includes a verbal warning, a written warning, disciplinary\nsuspension and or probation from work without pay and benefits, and finally termination of\nemployment. In deciding which initial corrective action would be appropriate, management will\nconsider the seriousness of the action, the circumstances surrounding the matter, and the\nemployee’s previous record. Step No. 1: Verbal Warning\nInform the employee that he/she must correct his/her actions or further disciplinary action will be\ntaken; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the employee sign\nthe form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days. Step No. 2: Written Warning\nWhen the performance or the policy violation does not improve or change, management will\nexplain to the employee that through observations, it appears that he/she is knowingly not meeting\nthe job requirement; explain that if the employee does not correct his/her actions he/she will be\nsubject to discipline; record the results of this conversation on the appropriate form; and have the\nemployee sign the form. This form will remain in the employees personnel file for 30 days. Step No.3: Disciplinary Suspension and Probation\nIf the employee's performance continues to be below standard or the policy violation is continually\nviolated, the management will: discuss the situation; inform the employee of his/her continued\ndeficiency; inform the employee of a suspension without compensation, benefits will not\naccrue nor will benefits be recoverable during the suspension period; record the result of\ndiscussion; have employee sign the appropriate form and suspend the employee. The employee\nwill also be notified that they will be on probation when s/he returns to work. Length of probation\nwill be determined on a case by case situation. This form will remain in the employees personnel\nfile. Step No. 4: Termination\nThis is the final step involved in the process and the Company is hopeful it does not have to\nemploy this step. In the event of Theft, Sexual Harassment and/or other types of actions\nPROHIBITED by policy, this step may, in fact, be the \"first\" step because of the serious offenses\ninvolved. In this step management will: discuss the situation, record the termination action on the\nappropriate form; inform the employee of the decision; show the employee the discipline form;\ncollect all Company materials and equipment; escort the employee from Company premises. This form will remain in the employees personnel file. Management reserves the right to terminate or discipline any employee as the Company, in its sole\ndiscretion, considers necessary in individual circumstances\n\n---\n\n## Page 41\n\n7.2 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nThe work rules and standards of conduct for the Company are important, and the Company regards\nthem seriously.

In the event of a vehicular accident involving a company-owned/leased vehicle or while on\ncompany business, the employee must report all information immediately to the Immediate\nSupervisor and/or the Office. In no instance should responsibility for an accident be expressed to\nanyone until the proper person in the company has been notified and permission has been obtained\nto make statements. 10.4 HAZARDOUS WASTES\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has grouped certain chemicals and chemical groups into\ncategories which have been defined as toxic. This means that in concentrated forms or by\naccumulating and combining with other chemicals (even the air), these chemicals can be\nhazardous to human health if exposure occurs. From time to time in the normal course of their jobs, employees may handle materials which have\nbeen classified as hazardous by the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)\nregulations. Hazardous materials that are received from our suppliers should have Safety Date Sheets (SDS) or\nlabels which state the chemical ingredients of the contents, precautions to take, and what to do if\nexposure occurs. ---\n\n## Page 49\n\nEmployees will be instructed on how to control hazardous wastes and what to do if they are\nexposed to hazardous wastes. If any employee suspects that the materials or wastes he/she may encounter as an employee are\nhazardous (whether or not they are being created or used by the company), he/she should inform\nthe Immediate Supervisor immediately. As a Company, we are committed to not creating or disposing of hazardous wastes which will\ncontaminate the environment. Whenever possible, we will choose materials which have been\njudged as non-hazardous and will properly dispose of hazardous materials if used. Also, we will\nnot knowingly dump any wastes into the environment at any time. 10.5 WRITTEN HAZARD COMMUNICATIONS/RIGHT TO KNOW PROGRAM\n\nIn order to comply with the OSHA Hazard Communication/Right to Know Standard, the following\nRight to Know Program has been established for the Company. The Safety Officer is the program coordinator and has overall responsibility for the Hazard\nCommunication program. This program includes guidelines on identification of chemical hazards\nand the proper use of labels and Safety Data Sheets. SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDS)\nThe Company maintains an inventory of all known chemicals in use on the work site, in the shop\nand yard areas. A copy of the list is included with this program as well as with each set of SDS\nsheets. Further information on each noted chemical can be obtained by reviewing the SDS sheet. Hazardous chemicals brought onto the work site will be included on the Hazardous Chemical\nInventory list which will be in the SDS booklet. The safety officer will be responsible for obtaining, maintaining, and updating the SDS. Copies of\nSDS's for all hazardous chemicals and fact sheets to which employees may be exposed will be\nkept in the office, employee pickup, shop, and in the pit tool van. CONTAINER LABELING\nAll chemicals will be stored in their original containers with a proper label attached. Workers may\ndispense chemicals from original containers in small quantities for immediate use and any\nchemical left over must be returned to the original container. No unmarked containers of any size are tube left in the work area unattended. Manufacturer labels\nare to be left intact whenever possible. Containers that are not labeled will be relabeled. DO NOT leave extra oil in the oil cans!!!! EMPLOYEE TRAINING\nAll employees will receive the following training before being allowed to work with Hazardous\nchemicals found in the work site.

Severe injury may result when there is improper safeguarding. Safeguarding is a\nmethod of eliminating a hazard. No safeguard, barrier, or enclosure shall be adjusted or removed for any reason by anyone\n unless that person has specific permission from the supervisor, the employee has been\n specifically trained to do the work, and machine adjustment is considered a normal part of\n their job. Before safeguarding or other guarding devices are removed for repair, or adjustments or\n servicing are done, the power to the equipment must be turned off and the main switch\n locked out and tagged. No equipment or machine will be started unless the safeguards are in place and in good\n condition. Defective or missing safeguards must be immediately reported to the supervisor. No employee shall reach around a safeguard, barrier, or enclosure. The primary benefit of\n safeguarding is that it helps improve production. By safeguarding, employees are not\n afraid of the machine and they pay more attention to their production responsibilities. 10.15 LOCKOUT PROCEDURES\n\nPurpose: To prevent injury from the unexpected energization, start-up or stored energy that\ncould cause injury. ---\n\n## Page 54\n\nExamples of Energy for Lockout/Tagout Applies To:\n A. Electrical\n B. Mechanical\n C. Thermal, Steam\n D. Chemical, Acids & Caustics\n E. Explosives, Natural Gas\n F. Hydraulic\n G. Pneumatic\n H. Gravity\n\nSafety Rules for Lockout\n Never remove guards or reach around guards while any machine is operating. Prior to starting work on a piece of equipment, shut off the main power switch and place a\n lockout device on the switch. Make sure all movement has stopped before entering or servicing any machine. If more than one person is working at the same time, EVERY individual on that machine\n must have a lock on the lockout device. No lockout will be permitted to be cut off without\n authority from your supervisor. Any time you are working on presses, changing dies, or removing rules, the operator must\n lockout the machine and safety block must be in place. Lockouts must be placed when changing blade or adjusting blade. Make sure machine is clear, prior to restarting the machine. NO Machine down-time is worth LIFE, LIMB, or JOB!!!! Lockout Procedures\nIt is the responsibility of all supervisors to train employees on lockout procedures. This is\nessentially due to the grave threat to life and limb. Lockout procedures must be documented on the\nsupervisor's safety training checklist. Enforcement of lockout shall be the responsibility of\nsupervisors and management. If equipment needs repair, alterations, inspections, clearing of jams, or cleaning, the\n equipment must be shut down and locked out. The machine operator and others must be notified that the equipment cannot be set into\n motion without supervisor's permission. All sources of power are to be identified, turned off, and locked out. All stored energy\n sources must be removed. All personnel must be clear of the equipment. The equipment\n must be turned on to be sure the equipment power source is locked out, and then turned off\n again. Your padlocks must be placed on the control switch, lever or valve, even though\n someone has locked the controls before you. You will not be protected unless you put your\n own padlock on it. Once lockout is completed, you must hang a \"danger tag\" on the controls showing the date\n and the employee's signature. Pad-lock and tags must be in place before any work can be\n performed. When work is done, you must replace all guards and remove your own padlock and tag. Never permit someone else to remove it for you. Be sure you are not exposing another\n person to danger by removing your padlock or sign. When power has to be continued in order to perform a job, the area supervisor must be\n notified. A maintenance employee or supervisor will stand by while work is being\n performed. When the job is completed, padlocks will be reinstalled.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Construction_TNT_Construction.md", "company": "Tnt Construction", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Tnt Construction", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Construction_TNT_Construction.md_chunk_0026", "char_span": [125281, 129968], "sentence_count": 54, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Construction_TNT_Construction.md_chunk_0025", "next_chunk_id": "Construction_TNT_Construction.md_chunk_0027", "keywords": ["must", "lockout", "machine", "equipment", "that"], "policy_tags": ["REST", "WARN"], "hash_64": "3ac88c5743036631", "created_at": "2025-10-27T23:21:34.600417", "token_count": 998}}

The\n supervisor must see that guards are in place and all personnel are clear of danger areas. 10.16 BACK INJURY PREVENTION\n\nIt is the responsibility of all supervisors to train employees on proper lifting techniques. Supervisors must correct employees when using incorrect lifting techniques. Approximately fifty percent of all personal injuries are caused by overexertion and most of these\ninjuries are back injuries. Everyone should follow these proper lifting techniques. The two-hand squat and stoop method as follows:\n Get close to the load and grasp it firmly, hugging it. Set your stomach muscles as if you were doing a pelvic tilt. This helps prepare them to\n support the load. Keep your back upright with a slight backward arch as you use your leg muscles to lift the\n load. Set the load down smoothly. The assisted one-hand lift method is as follows:\nAs you bend over into a container, rest your free hand on the edge of the container for support, and\nuse the other hand and to lift the object or part. As you come out of the lift, push down with your\nfree hand on the container edge to push your back and object up. When there is no container to rest\nyour free hand on, use the area right above your knee as an anchor point. The assisted one-hand lift method is a way of lifting that is shared by the shoulder muscles, which\nare more developed than lower back muscles. This method does have limitations. This is the best\nmethod when the weight to be lifted does not exceed 15-25 pounds. In addition, these are back injury prevention safety tips:\n1. Lift comfortably. 2. Avoid unnecessary bending, twisting, and reaching. 3. Lift gradually and slowly. 4. Keep in good physical shape. If at all possible use a skidloader or get help!!! Don’t think you’re Superman. 10.17 WASTE CONTAINMENT\n\nAll waste fluids (oil and other fluids) drained from any equipment will be collected, stored in\nproper containers, labeled and disposed of in an approved manner. Waste oil must be recovered at\nall times. Waste oil from the jobsite may be brought to the shop facility and stored for future\n consumption or disposal. All disposal filters to be placed in 50 gallon barrel for proper disposal. 10.18 GARBAGE\n\nAll garbage is to be cleaned out of vehicles & equipment daily (no exceptions). Place garbage in brown receptacle east side of shop. Recyclable material (plastic, glass, steel & aluminum, paper & cardboard) in blue\n receptacle east side of shop. If you are in doubt about what’s recyclable the list is on the bulletin board. ---\n\n## Page 56\n\n10.19 VEHICLE, TRUCK & EQUIPMENT OPERATORS\n\n All vehicle, truck and equipment operators shall make a full and complete walk around\n inspection prior to the start of the workday and at the end of their day. There should be a 10-minute warm-up (a.m.) and a 10-minute cool-down (p.m.) on all\n equipment. Do not let equipment idle longer than 30 minutes unless cold weather conditions exist. Truck drivers are required to complete a pre-trip and post-trip safety checklist for each\n unit they operate and it shall be submitted to the office at the end of the day. No piece of equipment should be started without first checking OIL, FUEL, & WATER\n WILL BE CHECKED BEFORE TURNING THE KEY. It is the operator's\n responsibility to check fuel levels of equipment and prevent down time due to low fuel\n levels. (If you should run out of fuel because of not checking, you are on your own time. It\n causes downtime for the company, you, and another employee because you need fuel). Fuel tank should be filled every day. Keys shall not be left in unattended vehicles and equipment at the end of the day if left at a\n jobsite. All ignition keys are to be removed from equipment when being serviced and lower all\n attachments. All employees must adhere to lockout/tag out procedures as described in this\n policy.
