Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the work schedule and to report ready to\nwork, on time. Changes to the schedule may be necessary from time to time. Although an employee is not\nrequired to come in on their day off, your cooperation is appreciated. Working as a team means\nthat you will cover for a sick employee, knowing that perhaps the situation will be reversed in\nthe future and that employee will cover for you. If personal circumstances require it, you may request a schedule change. It is your responsibility\nto arrange a fill-in for the shift(s) you will miss. The replacement must be from the same\ndepartment and requires at least 24-hour advance notice to your department head. Management\nhas the right to refuse such a change if it causes the replacement to qualify for overtime or\notherwise creates a hardship to the replacement or the department operation. This provision\ndoes not apply to Bereavement leave, Jury Duty, the Family & Medical Leave Act, or scheduled\nMilitary Leave. Remember: It is your responsibility to know and follow your schedule. ###### Overtime\nSchedules are determined by the GM or department heads on a weekly basis and employees\nshould clock in and out according to that schedule. All overtime is to be approved by the\ndepartment head or GM prior to the employee working beyond their scheduled time. Overtime\nwill be paid at the rate of time and a half for hours exceeding 40 between Sunday at 12:01 a.m. and Saturday at 12:00 midnight. Overtime hours will be paid for only once. In no case will there be any pyramiding of overtime\nhours. Vacation time will not be considered as time worked for overtime purposes. ###### Absenteeism/Tardiness\nThe successful operation of the Hotel depends upon every team member being at work and on\ntime. Employees must notify their department head of an intended absence as soon as is known,\nbut in any event at least four hours before their scheduled starting time. This procedure must be\nfollowed for each day of absence. Failure to notify management of an expected absence may be\nconsidered a no-call, no-show situation and will result in a warning notice and counseling on\nattendance for the employee. If an employee doesn't show up for three shifts in a row, without\nnotification to management of any kind, it will be determined that they have quit their job. In\naddition, failure to report to work for three days (consecutive or otherwise) during any three\nconsecutive months, without authorization, may result in discharge without prior warning. ---\n\nIf an employee misses three or more consecutive days because of illness, a written notification\nfrom a physician describing the reason for the illness and absence may be required. This\nnotification must be submitted before the employee is allowed to return to work to ensure the\nemployee's health is adequate to perform work duties. If an employee is going to be late for a shift, it is their responsibility to call his/her department\nhead or supervisor as soon as is known, but in any event at least two hours before the scheduled\nstarting time. The employee must specify the time he/she may be expected to arrive for work. In\nsuch event, the manager may decide to cancel the employee's shift, at his/her discretion. If you are unable to speak directly to your department head to report that you will be late or sick,\nyou must leave a message. Within two hours after your start time, you must call back and speak\nwith your department head or GM\n\n###### Breaks\nA fifteen-minute rest break will be allowed during each four hours of a regularly scheduled work\nshift, at a time and place authorized by your department head.

Employees are required to punch out for\ntheir half-hour break. ###### Employee Travel and Reimbursement\nEmployees will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with approved\ntravel on behalf of the company. Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses and\nexercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety. If a circumstance arises that is not\nspecifically covered in the travel policies, the most conservative course of action should be\nadopted. Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned travel is\neligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements.

Be aware of any tendencies in\nthese regards and remember that safety is the priority. We also advise every employee to take\nnote of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of\nyour training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct\nany unsafe condition or practice.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0006", "char_span": [29374, 34383], "sentence_count": 42, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0005", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0007", "keywords": ["employees", "must", "that", "this", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "39cd09474f33ca73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.084351", "token_count": 1004}}

Within the scope of\nyour training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct\nany unsafe condition or practice. You are to report to your supervisor immediately any situation\nwhich appears unsafe to you and that you cannot correct yourself. \"Safety consciousness\" are key words each of us must remember at all times. Employees with\npoor safety records are a hazard to all of us, and are subject to dismissal. While most safety\nprecautions are simply a matter of common sense and good housekeeping, we have developed a\nsafety notebook which is available in your department. It is your responsibility to read the\nnotebook and become familiar with proper safety procedures. ###### Use of Equipment\nEmployees are not to work with any equipment or machinery which they have not been properly\ntrained on. ###### Material Safety Data Sheets (M.S.D.S.)\nFor your protection, M.S.D.S. sheets are available for your review.

There are many ways\nto make this property a safer place:\n\n- Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable,\ndo not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the\nperson if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say\nsomething like, \"Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need\nhelp, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), \"Are you a guest\nhere?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a\nlegitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better\nto err on the side of caution. - Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. - Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. - Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting\ninformation about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General\nManager. - Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may\noffer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor. - Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or\ndepartment. - Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,\nthey should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel\nemployee.

Employee files are kept confidential, and may not be viewed without proper authorization from\nthe GM. Information in an employee file may never be used for any reason other than legitimate\nhotel purposes. Violation of these policies is subject to discipline up to and including\ntermination. Any department head considering the hire of a former employee or transfer of a\ncurrent employee may be granted access to that employee’s file. Employees are entitled to\nreview their file. Although the file cannot leave the office in which it is kept, your General\nManager can make arrangements for you to review the file. ###### Introductory Period\nThe first 60 days of employment is an introductory period; during which time employees will be\nevaluated carefully to determine their suitability for their position. An employee who fails to\nperform satisfactorily during this time may be terminated without notice. In some situations, the employee may receive a training wage during their introductory period. ###### Performance Reviews\nPeriodically, written performance reviews will be given by your department head. A\nperformance review will normally be given at least once a year and will be placed in your\npersonnel file. Performance reviews do not always result in a pay increase. ---\n\n###### Discipline\nEvery employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by existing rules\nand policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/her duties to the best of\nhis/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her job description or as otherwise\nestablished. When policies and procedures are not being followed, it is the responsibility of your department\nhead or the general manager to correct the situation. This will take the form of\ncoaching/counseling; or more formal verbal and/or written warnings. The Hotel reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending on the facts of\neach situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching,\ncounseling and/or training; the employee's work record; and the impact the conduct and\nperformance issues have on our organization. Initially, when an employee displays unacceptable behavior or his/her performance is not\nmeeting the job requirements, the employee will be made aware of the situation and be given an\nopportunity to correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time. In some cases, this initial\ncontact may include a verbal warning. A verbal warning will occur if previous coaching has not corrected the problem or if the initial\nissue is sufficiently serious. The warning will be noted in the employee's personnel records. A written warning is given when your department head or the general manager believes that an\noffense is sufficiently serious or when a verbal warning has proven insufficient. The written\nwarning may also include a notation indicating that the next similar transgression will result in\ntermination. You should recognize the grave nature of the written warning. If you feel the\nwarning is inaccurate or unwarranted, you may respond, in writing, and your response will be\nattached to the written warning and placed in your personnel file. An employee may be terminated if he/she has three written warnings, for any reason, in their file. For problems deemed to be serious enough, or for failure to respond appropriately to prior\ncounseling and warnings, suspension and/or termination may occur. If suspended, the employee\nwill be expected to leave the premises immediately and remain off work, without pay, for the\nduration of their suspension. If an employee is terminated, they will be expected to leave the premises immediately. A final\npaycheck will be issued the same day (or the next business day if termination happens on a\nweekend).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0009", "char_span": [44841, 50123], "sentence_count": 42, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0008", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0010", "keywords": ["will", "employee", "employees", "hotel", "that"], "policy_tags": ["WARN"], "hash_64": "39cdad4767236e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.097814", "token_count": 1020}}

Among the various factors\ncomplicating matters, the following three \"risks\" are readily apparent. Risk to the business, reflected in three main areas:\n\n1. Financial defalcation\n2. Inappropriate influence over decision making Judgment\n\n---\n\n1. Compromising operational policies/procedures\n2. Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism. 3. Risk of sexual harassment suits. As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the\nworkplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to\nprotect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the\nintent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,\nthereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management. This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):\n\n1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:\na. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 1. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the\nconnection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential\nconflict of interest by compromising any of the following:\n\na. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to\ncommunicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject\nthat responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral\nreassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for\nthe purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to\nprudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior\" positions. There is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In\nthat event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel. ###### Guest Privacy\nEmployees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on\npremise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out. An\nemployee is in a position to observe the personal actions of many people. It is mandatory that\nyou never discuss your observations either within or outside the property. However, should you\nnotice anything detrimental to the property or its guests, notify your department head, the\nGeneral Manager immediately. Keep in mind that all guest services (pool, fitness center, lobby, van, etc.) are for guest use only,\nunless otherwise allowed by the GM\n\n---\n\nUnder no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation\nunless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. ###### Leaving Property during Work Hours\nIt is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to\nconduct personal business. The department head is responsible for maintaining proper staffing at\nall times, so if it is necessary to leave the property at any time during work hours, the employee\nmust do the following:\n\n1. Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property. 2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning. 3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns. ###### Lost and Found\nWhen an employee finds a lost and found item, they should turn it in to the designated lost and\nfound location (usually the Front Desk or the Housekeeping Department) as soon as possible.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0011", "char_span": [55262, 60116], "sentence_count": 55, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0010", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0012", "keywords": ["employee", "will", "general", "department", "that"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "REST"], "hash_64": "39cb8c474b232f71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:06.106755", "token_count": 1012}}

The Company will not tolerate harassment of any type. Harassment is any offensive, unwelcome physical or verbal behavior, including but not limited\nto, comments or conduct related to a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual\norientation, age, disability or veteran status. Sexual harassment, which is unwelcome sexual\nadvances or other sexual behavior, is also prohibited as set forth in the Hotel’s Policy against\nSexual Harassment. Any employee who is subjected to harassment should report all such incidents directly to\nmanagement. A Confidential Report of Harassment is available for employee use. Upon\nreceiving a harassment complaint, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be conducted\nand, if warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken. However, no disciplinary action\nwill be taken without a thorough investigation of the facts. No employee will suffer retaliation or\nany form of punishment for voicing a valid concern. ###### Bullying\nThe Hotel defines bullying as “repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether\nverbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the\nplace of work and/or in the course of employment.” Such behavior violates the company’s intent\nthat all employees will be treated with dignity and respect. The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors, managers\nand executives, that the company will not tolerate bullying behavior. Employees found in\nviolation of this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination. ###### HOTEL POLICY AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT\n\nThe Hotel’s Policy against Sexual Harassment prohibits sexual harassment by employees\n(management or non-management) wherever work or work related activities are being\nperformed. Under the policy, a manager cannot state, suggest or imply that an employee's submission to or\nrejection of sexual advances will in any way influence any personnel decision regarding that\nemployee's employment, wages, advancement, assigned duties, schedule, or any other condition\nof employment. Other physical or verbal conduct that creates a sexually offensive work place, whether\ncommitted by management or non-management employees, is also prohibited. Examples of this\n\n---\n\nconduct include offensive or unwelcome sexual remarks, flirtations, advances or propositions;\noffensive or unwelcome verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic statements about a person's\nbody; sexually degrading words used to describe a person; the display of sexually suggestive\nobjects or pictures; any form of unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct. Sexual harassment at work by any employee will result in disciplinary action up to and including\ndismissal, and may lead to personal legal and financial liability. If an employee feels that they have been sexually harassed, they are encouraged to fill out a\nharassment form. Upon receiving a harassment complaint, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be\nconducted and, if warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken.
