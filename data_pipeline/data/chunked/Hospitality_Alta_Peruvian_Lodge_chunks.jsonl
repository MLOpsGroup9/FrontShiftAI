Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule\nThe employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently\n(take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain circumstances, may use the\nleave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a reduced-hour schedule. In all cases, the\nleave may not exceed a total of 12 workweeks (or 26 workweeks to care for an injured or ill\nservice member over a 12-month period). You may be required to provide medical certifications when requesting FMLA leave. You may\nalso elect to substitute, or the hotel may require that you use, any available paid leave before\nusing FMLA leave. Thirty days advance notice must be given when requesting FMLA leave, except for emergency\nor other unforeseeable situations. Within five business days after the employee has submitted the\nappropriate certification form, the general manager will provide the employee with a written\nresponse to the employee’s request for FMLA leave. The company may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee’s\nstatus and intent to return to work. Generally, when you return to work you will be returned to the same position that you held when\nyour FMLA leave began or, at the hotel's option, to an equivalent position. The hotel will not be\nrequired to reinstate you to any position if the position or shift you worked has been eliminated,\nor if the specific project you were working on has been completed. An employee who takes leave\nunder this policy may be asked to provide a fitness for duty (FFD) clearance from the health care\nprovider.

If you feel at all uncomfortable,\n do not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the\n person if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say\nsomething like, \"Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need\nhelp, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), \"Are you a guest\nhere?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a\nlegitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better\nto err on the side of caution. - Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. - Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. - Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting\n information about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General\n Manager. - Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc. However, you may\n offer to phone the guest on behalf of the visitor and hand the phone over to the visitor. - Employees are not allowed in any area of the hotel that is not associated with their job or\n department. - Anytime an employee has occasion to enter a guest room for legitimate hotel business,\n they should always knock and clearly and audibly identify themselves as a hotel\n employee.

Temporary employees may work full-time or parttime. Temporary employees are not eligible for employee benefits. If an employee becomes aware of any actual violence, imminent violence, or threat of imminent\nviolence, obtaining emergency assistance must be a matter of first priority. The employee should\nimmediately contact local law enforcement authorities by dialing 911. Immediately after\ncontacting the law enforcement authorities for emergency assistance, the employee must report\nthe incident to the General Manager or Company President immediately. Employees may report\nany incidents of violence or threats of violence without fear of reprisal or any kind. Employees who become aware of any threats of workplace violence must report the threats\nimmediately to the GM or President who will consult with the appropriate resources in order to\ncomplete an assessment of the incident and the surrounding circumstances. In cases where it is determined that an employee has violated this policy by threatening another\nindividual with violence or engaging in violent behavior, management will determine the\nappropriate corrective action, if any, including whether disciplinary action is warranted. If it is\ndetermined that a threat of violence was made or actual violence has occurred, disciplinary\naction will be imposed, up to and possibly including immediate termination and/or contacting\nlocal authorities.

As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the\nworkplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to\nprotect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the\nintent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,\nthereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management. This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):\n\n 1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:\n a. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 2. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the\n connection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential\n conflict of interest by compromising any of the following:\n a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to\ncommunicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject\nthat responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral\nreassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for\nthe purpose of working out details of a reassignment.

Guest Privacy\nEmployees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on\npremise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out.

Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism. 5. Risk of sexual harassment suits. As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the\nworkplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to\nprotect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the\nintent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,\nthereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management. This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):\n\n1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:\na. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 2. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the\nconnection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential\nconflict of interest by compromising any of the following:\n\na. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to\ncommunicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject\nthat responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral\nreassignment of either party.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md", "company": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Alta Peruvian Lodge", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0022", "char_span": [110125, 115000], "sentence_count": 67, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0021", "next_chunk_id": "Hospitality_Alta_Peruvian_Lodge.md_chunk_0023", "keywords": ["will", "that", "person", "other", "hotel"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "REST"], "hash_64": "31cbb9474b232f71", "created_at": "2025-11-18T19:09:41.281643", "token_count": 1016}}
