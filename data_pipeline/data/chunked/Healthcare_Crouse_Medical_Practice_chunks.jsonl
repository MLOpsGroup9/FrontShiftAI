These documents are available in full detail to all\nemployees on a shared drive. Employees will be asked to affirm that they understand where to\naccess such detailed policies and procedures. Crouse Medical Practice strives to provide an employee-friendly environment in which goaloriented individuals thrive. Our company commitment to serving patients and providing quality\npatient care is unwavering. These policies, procedures and working conditions provide a work\nenvironment in which both patient and employee interests are served. We value our employees’ talents, skills and abilities and seek to foster an open, cooperative and\ndynamic environment in which we can all excel. Crouse Medical Practice provides an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to bring ideas and challenges to any level of\nmanagement. This handbook contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be\ncomprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general\npolicies and procedures described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning\neligibility for a particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should\naddress your specific questions to the Human Resources Department. No provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical\nPractice’s President, or designee. ##### At-Will Employment Statement\n\nEmployment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an\nemployee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time,\nfor any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it\nintended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will\nemployment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written\ncontract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual. Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual\nright, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it\nguarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0000", "char_span": [0, 5060], "sentence_count": 54, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": null, "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0001", "keywords": ["employment", "medical", "crouse", "employee", "practice"], "policy_tags": ["COBRA", "FMLA", "HARASSMENT", "I-9", "OVERTIME", "PTO", "REST"], "hash_64": "388fb9dd4b67fe49", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.163719", "token_count": 987}}
{"text": "Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual\nright, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it\nguarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for\nany specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by\nCrouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are\ndisciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to\nterminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps. ---\n\nNo supervisor or other representative of Crouse Medical Practice except the Owner and/or\nPresident has the authority to enter into any contract of employment for any specified period of\ntime, or to make any agreement contrary to the above. The policies and procedures outlined will be applied at the discretion of Crouse Medical Practice\nmanagement. As such, Crouse Medical Practice may deviate from the policies, procedures,\nbenefits and working conditions described in this handbook. The company may also withdraw or\nchange the policies, procedures, benefits and working conditions described in this handbook at\nany time, for any reason. While it is our goal to provide employees with notice of such changes,\nprior notice is not required before a change is implemented. Throughout an employee’s\nemployment with Crouse Medical Practice, it is his or her responsibility to remain up to date on\ncompany policies, procedures, benefits and work conditions-both published and unpublished. Some of the subjects described here are covered in detail in official benefit policy documents. You should refer to those documents for specific information since this handbook only briefly\nsummarizes those benefits. Please note that the terms of the written insurance policies are\ncontrolling. ##### Crouse Health System\n\n![Crouse Health System, Inc.

Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and\nthose we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be\nsuccessful in his or her work.

It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0001", "char_span": [5060, 9742], "sentence_count": 22, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0000", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0002", "keywords": ["crouse", "medical", "this", "without", "employees"], "policy_tags": ["ADA"], "hash_64": "3985cd465f366779", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.167732", "token_count": 986}}
{"text": "It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of\nindividuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate\nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,\nadvancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of\nemployment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided\nwithout creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given\nthe same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and\nemployees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the\nrequested accommodations result in the following:\n\n A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace\nand the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or\n An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company\nADA policy. ---\n\nThe Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including\nthe resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues. Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation. ##### Employee Classification\n\nEmployees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as\ndetermined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:\n\n *Exempt -* Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including\nmanagerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or\npart-time status.  *Non-Exempt -* Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards. Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these\nemployees. Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their fulltime or part-time status. ##### Employment Resignation and Termination\n\nTermination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons\nfor termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your\nanticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and\nexempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice\n(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract). Upon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with\nan accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year. In the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work\nforce, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off\n(PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be\nspecifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please\nrefer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. If you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will\nassume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline\nPolicy #600-002. ---\n\n##### Employment Status\n\n**FULL-TIME** - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such\nfull-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service\nhave been met. **PART-TIME** - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be parttime and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who\nwork on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s\nCompensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other\nemployee benefits. **PER DIEM** - Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of\nhours. These employees are not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except legally\nmandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits). **CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE** - Employees who have a written contract with CMP that defines\nthe scope of their benefits with the organization.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0002", "char_span": [9742, 14877], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0001", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0003", "keywords": ["employees", "eligible", "employment", "benefits", "work"], "policy_tags": ["ADA", "EEOC", "FLSA", "OVERTIME", "PTO"], "hash_64": "39c5c9454f226e43", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.172171", "token_count": 1005}}

{"text": "An employee who alleges an employer has violated [New York Labor Law] Section 203-e may\nbring a civil action against the employer in any court of competent jurisdiction, which may award\ndamages, injunctive relief, reinstatement, and/or liquidated damages. Liquidated damages will\nequal 100 percent of the damages award unless the employer proves it had a good-faith basis\nto believe its actions complied with the law. In addition, separate civil penalties are available if\nan employer is found to have engaged in retaliation or retaliatory personnel action against an\nemployee for exercising rights under Section 203-e. Please contact Human Resources with questions or concerns. ##### Internal Transfer and/or Promotion\n\nThe company strives to retain employees through an environment that creates opportunity and\nencourages advancement. It is our goal to allow employees to fully use and develop their skills. When a position becomes available, it will be advertised both internally and externally. Current\nemployees are welcome to apply, as are external candidates. All staffing decisions will be made\nwith the position goals in mind, with the desire to hire the most-qualified individual being\nparamount. At times, positions may be filled internally without being posted. This could relate to a business\nneed or a planned career progression that includes an employee being assigned new\nresponsibilities. In order to be considered for a transfer or promotion, you should contact Human Resources and\nexpress interest in pursuing the opportunity. Details regarding internal transfers can be found in\nCMP’s Internal Position Transfer Policy #600-019. After the interview process is complete, if you\nare selected for the position, you will receive documentation and the transition process will\nbegin. ##### I-9 Immigration Reform\n\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to hire and retain\nonly individuals who are authorized to work in the United States. To enforce these guidelines, IRCA requires an employer to verify a potential employee’s\neligibility by completing the Employment Verification Form (Form I-9). By completing Form I-9,\nthe employer is certifying that it has viewed documents proving that the potential employee is\nauthorized to live and work in the United States. All employees are asked to provide original documents verifying their right to work in the United\nStates and to sign a verification form (Form I-9). If an individual cannot verify his or her right to\n\n---\n\nwork within three (3) days of hire, Crouse Medical Practice must terminate his or her\nemployment. Please contact Human Resources with questions or concerns. ##### Unemployment Insurance\n\nIncome protection in case of unemployment is provided depending upon your average weekly\nearnings as determined under New York State unemployment law qualifications. ##### Workplace Conduct\n\n##### Code of Conduct\n\nCrouse Medical Practice has adopted a Code of Conduct to provide standards and guidance by\nwhich employees, providers, volunteers and other individuals affiliated with Crouse Medical\nPractice will conduct themselves (collectively referred to as “Employees”). The Code of Conduct is a fundamental part of Crouse Medical Practice’s Corporate Compliance\nProgram, and works together with our Mission, Vision and Value statements and our Corporate\nCompliance Policies and Procedures.

It is important for all Employees to understand personal obligations to comply with this code,\nimmediately report any alleged violations of wrongdoing, and assist management and the\nCompliance Officer in investigating and/or addressing suspected violations.

Instead, the Code contains principles that are\nintended to guide Employees in making ethical decisions in carrying out duties for or on behalf\nof Crouse Medical Practice. All Employees share in the responsibility to uphold the principles of\ncaring, honesty and integrity that are fundamental to this Code of Conduct. Please refer to the full Code of Conduct Policy #100-001, your supervisor or Corporate\nCompliance Officer with questions.

Compliance with this Substance Abuse in the Workplace Policy is a condition of employment. Please refer to CMP’s Substance Abuse in the Workplace Policy #600-008. ##### False Claims Act and Whistleblower Protections\n\nIt is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal\nhealthcare programs. Crouse Medical Practice is committed to prompt, complete, and accurate\nbilling of all services provided to individuals. Crouse Medical Practice and its employees,\nproviders, contractors, and agents shall not make or submit any false or misleading entries on\nany claim forms. No employee, provider, contractor, or agent shall engage in any arrangement\nor participate in such arrangement at the direction of another person, including any supervisor or\nmanager that results in the submission of a false or misleading entry on claims forms or\ndocumentation of services that result in the submission of a false claim. Such acts are strictly\nprohibited by Crouse Medical Practice and any employee, provider, contractor or agent\n\n---\n\ncommitting or allowing such acts will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including\ntermination. The Federal False Claims Act **(31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733)** & NYS False Claims Act, NY **State**\n**Finance Law, Article 13 §§ 187-194** , are Federal & State laws designed to prevent and detect\nfraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. Under the\nFederal and State False Claims Act, anyone who “knowingly” submits a false claim to the\nGovernment is liable for damages up to three times the amount of the erroneous payment plus\nFederal or State penalties ranging from no less than $5,000 to $12,000. The amount of damages\nmay be reduced if the violator self discloses the violation. In addition to the penalties above, any\nviolation could result in, but not limited to, criminal proceedings.

PFL is available for eligible employees to take paid time off from work for the\nfollowing purposes:\n\n to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child;\n\n---\n\n to care for a covered family member (including spouses, domestic partners,\nchildren, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, and grandchildren) with a\nserious health condition; or\n to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active\nmilitary duty. For further information please refer to CMP’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) Policy #600-020. ##### Paid Time Off (PTO)\n\nCrouse Medical Practice believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away\nfrom work to help balance their lives. For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)\nprogram to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to\ndecide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule. Employees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:\n\n As vacation\n For personal business\n For periods of illness\n For religious observation\n For doctor or dental appointments\n For personal or family emergencies\n In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions\n\n##### Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual\n\nAll full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO\nhours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total\namount of PTO time in two equally divided “buckets” to current employees in the beginning of\nthe first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year. Time allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. - the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):\n\n Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the\nemployee’s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the\ncompletion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires.  Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an\nexempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If\nthey work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the\nmonth following the date of hire for new hires. When an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to\ndetermine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or\nwith less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees\n\n---\n\nmay roll up to forty (40) hours of PTO from one calendar year to the next unless otherwise\nspecified in an employment contract or offer letter. Unless specified otherwise in an employment agreement or offer letter, PTO time is earned as\noutlined in CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. ##### Personal Leave\n\nCrouse Medical Practice complies with all federal and state leave laws. However, when these\nlaws do not apply or an employee does not meet the eligibility requirements, the company will\nconsider an employee’s request for a personal leave. ##### Time Off to Vote\n\nCrouse Medical Practice encourages all employees to vote. It is the policy of Crouse Medical\nPractice to comply with all state election laws with respect to providing employees time off to\nvote. If an employee has four consecutive hours, either between the opening of the polls in his or her\ncommunity and the beginning of the workday or between the end of the workday and the closing\nof the polls, it will be deemed that the employee has sufficient time outside his or her normal\nworking hours in which to vote. If an employee has less than four consecutive hours in the time periods described above, he or\nshe may take up to two (2) hours of working time to vote. This time is eligible as paid voting\nleave, and such time shall be taken only at the beginning or end of the employee’s workday as\ndesignated by his or her supervisor.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md", "company": "Crouse Medical Practice", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Crouse Medical Practice", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0012", "char_span": [59527, 64068], "sentence_count": 32, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0011", "next_chunk_id": "Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice.md_chunk_0013", "keywords": ["time", "hours", "employees", "will", "paid"], "policy_tags": ["PTO"], "hash_64": "39cdfd5f5f22662b", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:07.213945", "token_count": 1022}}

It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure\nthat your time is correctly recorded (i.e. by punching in and out of your shifts, every day). Detailed instructions will be given to you by your supervisor. Failure to properly record your work time may be subject to disciplinary procedures, up to and\npossibly including termination. ##### Overtime Pay\n\nCrouse Medical Practice must compensate all hourly, non-exempt employees one-and-a-half\ntimes their hourly wage rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours each week. PTO and\nCompany Holidays do not count towards the calculation of overtime. The company’s workweek begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. At times, employees will be asked to work overtime to complete necessary work tasks. The\nemployee’s supervisor will notify the employee as early as possible regarding scheduling needs. Employees who want to work more than 40 hours during a workweek must receive authorization\nfrom their supervisor before working overtime. ##### Pay Periods and Check Distribution/Direct Deposit Voucher\n\nThe standard pay period at Crouse Medical Practice consists of two (2), 7-day, 40 hour weeks\nand starts on a Sunday and ends on the second following Saturday. Employees will be paid on\na bi-weekly basis on Friday. If paydays fall on non-workdays or holidays, employees will be paid\non the last workday prior to the regularly scheduled payday. It is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to offer employee’s the option to receive payments via\nelectronic direct deposit and/or live payroll check. The payroll office or Human Resources will\nassist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any\nquestions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit. ---\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for\nemployees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will\nbe electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated\nby each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or\ncredit unions that support direct deposit. It is each employee’s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal\ninformation and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has\nbeen an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not\nentitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid\namounts from future paychecks. Paychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be\nreleased to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the\nemployee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on\nthe date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or\nshe returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day. If an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to\npayroll information through the Company’s payroll service provider. ##### Performance Evaluation\n\nCrouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,\nabout your job performance. Managers and supervisors are responsible for providing ongoing\nperformance feedback to each employee. In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally\ndiscuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may\nbe conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position. Your performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas\nneeding improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance\nproblems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal\ndiscussions or formal disciplinary action. Formal performance feedback becomes a permanent\npart of your personnel file. Please contact Human Resources if you have any questions. ##### Personnel Records\n\nCrouse Medical Practice strives to keep accurate and up-to-date personnel records.
