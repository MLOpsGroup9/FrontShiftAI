Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and\n those we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be\n successful in his or her work. Diversity isall of the ways we are different as individual people - the characteristics of who\n we are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences. Our culture and values support diversity and inclusion by:\n\n  Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team\n  Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s\n and our community\n  Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and\n perspectives\n\nEmployment\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or\nmore employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of\nindividuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate\nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,\nadvancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of\nemployment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided\nwithout creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given\nthe same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and\nemployees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the\nrequested accommodations result in the following:\n\n  A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace\n and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or\n  An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company\nADA policy. 4 | P a g e\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity creates Inclusion.

To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and\nexempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice\n(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract).

Telephone & Cell Phone Usage\n\nCrouse Medical Practice provides phones to employees to increase efficiency in doing\nbusiness. There are important things to consider when using company phones. Please adhere\nto the following guidelines, based on the type of call you are making or receiving:\n\n  Business phone calls - Much of our business is conducted over the phone, making our\n telephone communication extremely important. A friendly but professional telephone\n manner should always be projected.  Personal phone calls - We recognize that periodically, personal phone calls must be\n made or received during the business hours. Such calls should be held at a minimum so\n that they do not interfere with the workflow. Additionally, these calls should be made\n outside of any patient care or public area.  Personal cell phone - Unless required for your job, cell phone usage will not be allowed\n for personal calls, text messaging, surfing the Internet, receiving or responding to email,\n checking phone messages or any other purpose during business hours. Please inform\n family and friends that your cell phone will be unavailable during work hours. If there is\n an emergency family/friends should attempt to reach you by calling the office first.
