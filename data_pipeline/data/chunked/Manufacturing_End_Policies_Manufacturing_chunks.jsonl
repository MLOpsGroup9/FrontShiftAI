When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to\ntelephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may\nbe absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin\nwhen they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee’s time\nsheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance\napproval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to\ndiscipline. Upon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the\nreason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor’s certificate, to substantiate the\nabsence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or\nwritten reprimand, or termination of employment. Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early\ndepartures as well as absence for an entire day. An employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to\nhave voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY. Employees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records. Employees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log\nout for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business\npurposes as part of their job duties. Tampering with another employee’s time records, including logging another\nemployee in or out, is prohibited and may result in immediate termination.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md", "company": "End Policies Manufacturing", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "End Policies Manufacturing", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0001", "char_span": [3401, 7521], "sentence_count": 29, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0000", "next_chunk_id": "Manufacturing_End_Policies_Manufacturing.md_chunk_0002", "keywords": ["this", "time", "handbook", "employment", "jewelry"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "39cfad5f57226639", "created_at": "2025-11-18T19:09:43.051017", "token_count": 1007}}
