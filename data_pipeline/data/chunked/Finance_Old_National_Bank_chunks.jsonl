The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of\nevery job. These include:\n\nEssential Duties and Responsibilities\n- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities\n- Dimensional Data\n- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities\n- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job\nresponsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to\nidentify the appropriate career level for the position. Pay Ranges\nEach career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range\nminimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and\nperformance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job’s pay range. The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the\nquality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member’s pay closer\nto the midpoint of the job’s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of\nthe preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career\nlevels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels. The maximum of a salary range represents the highest possible value of the job. Team members generally will not\nreceive increases beyond the maximum of their current job grade.

Insurance Continuation (COBRA)\n\nThe federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives team members and their qualified\nbeneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under various Old National plans when a\n“qualifying event” would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common qualifying events include:\n\nTermination of employment + Divorce or legal separation\nDeath of a team member + Adependent child no longer meeting\nReduction in a team member's hours eligibility requirements. Leave of absence\n\nThe team member must notify the Plan Administrator of a divorce, legal separation, termination of domestic partner\nrelationship, or a dependent child becoming ineligible within 30 days after the event occurs, otherwise continuation\ntights will be lost. If you wish to extend coverage because of disability, you must notify the Plan Administrator of the\ndisability before the 18-month continuation coverage period ends, otherwise extension rights will be lost. Under COBRA, the team member or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at Old National's group rates plus an\nadministration fee. Each eligible team member will receive a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA\nwhen the team member becomes eligible for coverage under various Old National plans. The notice contains important\ninformation about the team member's rights and obligations and generally will be mailed within two weeks from the\ndate coverage ceases. Team members, their spouse/domestic partner and/or dependent children may separately choose to continue or\nwaive coverage, and to change coverage during any future open enrollment period following the COBRA election.

Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short\nnotice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities. Paid military exigency leave may also\nqualify for FMLA and/or state law protection. Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for\npay purposes. MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE\nOld National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (“nearest blood\nrelative”) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state\nlaw protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave\nplan design for pay purposes. Personal Leave\nOld National provides leaves of absence without pay to eligible team members who wish to take time off from work\nduties to fulfill obligations other than qualifying FMLA events such as, visiting family in a foreign country, or a mission\ntrip. Additionally, team members that do not meet the service requirements for paid leave for their own medical\ncondition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave. All team members are eligible to request\npersonal leave. One personal leave may be granted for a period of up to 30 consecutive calendar days every two years per supervisor\napproval. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single\nextension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be\nevaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the\nproposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)\nbefore going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it\nis available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot\nguarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. Worker’s Compensation Insurance\nOld National provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This\nprogram covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,\nsurgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers’ compensation insurance\nprovides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses. Team members who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. You or your\nsupervisor should then contact HR Shared Services for completion of necessary forms. If treatment is needed, HR\nShared Services can assist you in finding a workers’ comp healthcare provider. No matter how minor an on-the-job\ninjury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible team member to qualify for\ncoverage as quickly as possible. Failure to do so may result in a delay in workers’ compensation benefits. Old National\nwill not retaliate against any team member for reporting a work-related injury or illness. MILITARY EXIGENCY LEAVE\n\nOld National provides paid military exigency leave to eligible team members.

{"text": "Personal Leave\n\nOld National provides leaves of absence without pay to eligible team members who wish to take time off from work\nduties to fulfill obligations other than qualifying FMLA events such as, visiting family in a foreign country, or a mission\ntrip. Additionally, team members that do not meet the service requirements for paid leave for their own medical\ncondition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave. All team members are eligible to request\npersonal leave. One personal leave may be granted for a period of up to 30 consecutive calendar days every two years per supervisor\napproval. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single\nextension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be\nevaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the\nproposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)\nbefore going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it\nis available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot\nguarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. Worker’s Compensation Insurance\n\nOld National provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This\nprogram covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,\nsurgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers’ compensation insurance\nprovides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses. Team members who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. You or your\nsupervisor should then contact HR Shared Services for completion of necessary forms. If treatment is needed, HR\nShared Services can assist you in finding a workers’ comp healthcare provider. No matter how minor an on-the-job\ninjury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible team member to qualify for\ncoverage as quickly as possible. Failure to do so may result in a delay in workers’ compensation benefits. Old National\nwill not retaliate against any team member for reporting a work-related injury or illness. ---\n\n## Page 33\n\nTEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK 33\n\nSubject to state workers’ compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the\npayment of workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member’s voluntary participation in\nany off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National.

EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM\n\nOld National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your\nimmediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business\ninterruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a\nmember of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their\nemployment with Old National. Even if you have paid time off to cover several absences and you report them to your manager in a timely manner, you\nmay be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. Your overall attendance record,\nincluding late arrivals and early departures, is an important consideration when being reviewed for promotional\nopportunities, transfers, and even salary increases. Your manager retains discretion in determining whether your\nabsences are excessive. While not an exhaustive list, your manager may consider the impact of your absences on the\ncompletion of work and/or on service levels, the frequency and length of the absences, the reasons for the absences,\nthe timing of your absences, etc. ---\n\n## Page 37\n\nTEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK 37\n\nManagers are responsible for monitoring attendance-related issues on a case-by-case basis and taking corrective\naction, if required.
