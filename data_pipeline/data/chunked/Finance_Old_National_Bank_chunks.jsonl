We embrace differences based on\nethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and national origin, as well as a wide range of unique\ncharacteristics, such as communication and learning styles. Diversity of thought, backgrounds, and experiences in\ncombination with an environment where differences are celebrated as assets drives innovation and leads to better\noutcomes for our business, communities, clients, and team members. We are better able to understand and meet\nthe changing needs of the communities and clients we serve by reflecting their diverse make-up. For us, an inclusive culture is a work environment that welcomes and embraces the strengths of our differences,\nsupports involvement, and provides everyone with equal access to opportunities and information. An inclusive culture\nthat celebrates all aspects of diversity creates loyalty, a sense of belonging, and a workplace where team members\nare valued, respected, and excited to deliver best-in-class service to our clients and communities.

The Company’s\nreputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and\nregulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity. The continued success of Old National is dependent upon our customers’ trust, and we are dedicated to preserving\nthat trust. Team members have a duty to Old National Bancorp, its customers, and shareholders to act in a way that\nwill merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Old National expects its directors, officers, and team members to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit,\nand intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment based on high ethical principles will guide you with respect to acceptable\nconduct.

Individuals who fail to acknowledge and accept the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics will be subject to termination of employment. ##### Compensation Administration\n\nOld National Bancorp recognizes that to attract, motivate and retain a highly skilled workforce, team members must be\ncompensated in a fair and equitable manner. The Company believes that all jobs are important to the success and\ngrowth of the organization. Therefore, a compensation philosophy has been adopted that ensures all team members a\ncompetitive compensation package based upon the type of work they do and how well they do it. This philosophy enables Old National to provide its entire workforce, from non-exempt team members to executive\nofficers, with competitive base pay and opportunities for additional financial rewards based on performance that\nmeets or exceeds established objectives. ---\n\n##### Job Documentation and Evaluation\n\nJob Documentation and Evaluation is the systematic process for obtaining important and relevant information about\neach distinct role in the organization. The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of\nevery job. These include:\n\n**Essential Duties and Responsibilities**\n\n- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities\n\n- Dimensional Data\n\n- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities\n\n- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job\nresponsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to\nidentify the appropriate career level for the position. ##### Pay Ranges\n\nEach career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range\nminimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and\nperformance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job’s pay range. The range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the\nquality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member’s pay closer\nto the midpoint of the job’s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of\nthe preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career\nlevels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0004", "char_span": [20532, 25900], "sentence_count": 31, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0003", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0005", "keywords": ["team", "conduct", "business", "national", "will"], "policy_tags": [], "hash_64": "388fb9464d676671", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.872280", "token_count": 1015}}

Please contact HR Shared Services for further\ninformation. ##### Conflicts of Interest\n\nConflicts of interest can harm the Company when someone’s outside interest or relationship interferes, or appears to\ninterfere, with their ability to make decisions and act in the best interest of Old National. We recognize our team\nmembers have a broad range of personal and community interests and involvement and we strive to find the right\nbalance between supporting those pursuits and protecting the reputation, brand, and financial success of the\nCompany. In some cases, the mere potential for conflict or the appearance of a conflict can be a problem, therefore,\nteam members should avoid situations which affect their ability to be objective and impartial or their loyalties may\nbecome divided. Old National recognizes not all conflicts of interest present a problem, and the Company seeks to\nidentify and manage all actual and potential conflicts of interest with integrity and transparency.

The Company is committed to complying fully with The Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (“ADAAA”) and all applicable state\nand local fair employment practices laws. Generally, discrimination against persons with a known association or\nrelationship with a disabled individual is prohibited. Old National provides reasonable accommodations in order for the\nindividual to perform the essential functions of the job in question. Old National does not retaliate against individuals\nbecause they request a reasonable accommodation. While many individuals with disabilities can work without accommodation, some individuals may face barriers to\nemployment in the absence of an accommodation process. If Old National is notified that a qualified individual with\na disability requires a reasonable accommodation in order to apply for a position, perform the essential functions\nof a job, or enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, the Company will work with the individual to find a\nreasonable accommodation unless doing so would impose a direct threat to the team member, applicant, or others\nand without imposing an undue hardship on Old National’s business. Initial requests for reasonable accommodation may be presented verbally or in writing to a Human Resources\nRepresentative or your supervisor. An individual seeking an accommodation will engage in an interactive dialog,\n“the interactive process” with their supervisor and/or a Human Resources Representative. Old National’s Human\nResources Department is responsible for determining if the individual is considered “qualified” and if a “reasonable\naccommodation” exists. The reasonable accommodation is not required to be the specific accommodation requested\nby the individual. There may be more than one way to reasonably accommodate the individual.

Job posting is a way to inform team members of openings and to identify\nqualified and interested applicants who might not otherwise be known to the hiring manager. Other recruiting sources\nmay also be used to fill open positions. There are situations where management may choose not to post a job such as\nopenings resulting from restructuring, reorganization or staff reductions or an opportunity to promote a current team\nmember. Most job openings will be posted on the Company’s Intranet site.

Supervisors are encouraged\nto support team members’ efforts to gain experience and advance within the organization.

Alternative Work Schedules are a part of this commitment.

Alternative work arrangements include, but are not\nlimited to, compressed work weeks, part-time hours, job sharing, reduced and/or flex hours. While these options are\nnot an entitlement, when managers and team members work together, they can turn a challenge into a true win-win\nsituation. If you encounter a situation that leads you to believe that an Alternative Work Schedule would meet your needs, you\nshould carefully consider how it will impact your department and be prepared with possible solutions when you meet\nwith your manager to request the Alternative Work Schedule. More information regarding Alternative Work Schedules, including the request form can be found in MyHR. ##### Employment Categories\n\nEmployment categories are established so that team members will understand their employment status and benefit\neligibility.

If you\nare called for jury duty and you are a full-time or part-time level I team member, you will receive your regular pay for\nyour regularly scheduled hours of work plus jury pay provided by the court. Team members must provide the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so the supervisor can\nplan for their absence. Team members are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either Old National or the team member may request an excuse from jury duty if, in Old National’s judgment, the team\nmember’s absence would create serious operational difficulties. Old National will continue to provide and accrue all\neligible benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. ##### Witness Duty\n\nOld National encourages team members to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. Team members should provide the subpoena to their supervisor as soon as possible so the supervisor can plan for\ntheir absence. Team members are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. If a team member is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by Old National, they will receive paid\ntime for the entire period of witness duty. If a team member is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as\nwitnesses by a party other than Old National, they should use Paid Time Off (PTO). ##### Time Off to Vote\n\nTime Off to Vote Old National encourages team members to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in\nelections. Generally, team members find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If team\nmembers are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, Old National provides all team members up\nto two hours of paid time to vote. In state or areas with laws which require employers to provide more than two hours\nfor voting, we comply with those local or state laws and requirements\n\n## Leave Policies\n\n##### Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nOld National complies with all applicable federal and state labor and employment laws, including the Family and\nMedical Leave Act (FMLA).

We are pleased to assist team members with access to\npaid leave to attend to these important matters. To be eligible for paid leave, a team member must be either full-time or\npart-time level I and have a qualifying, approved, continuous leave that begins on or after six months of continuous\nservice for leaves due to a team member’s own serious health condition and on or after one year of continuous service\nfor Caregiver and Parental Leaves.

This paid leave may also qualify\nfor FMLA and/or state law protection. Consecutive leave periods separated by 14 days or less for the same medical\ncondition are considered one period of disability. Team members are expected to work if they are physically able to perform the job and return to work as soon as\nreleased by their medical provider. A medical release must be submitted to UNUM upon the team member’s return to\nwork. **PLAN DESIGN** **MEDICAL LEAVE/SHORT-TERM DISABILITY**\n\n**PTO Usage Required** 40 hours of PTO must be used before going on paid leave status (20 hours for parttime level I).

To qualify for Parental Leave, a team member must be\neither Full-Time or Part-Time Level I, have one or more year of service at the time of the Parental Event, and use one\nweek of PTO for the first week of paid leave associated with the Parental Event. A paid leave for a birthing parent begins with Short-Term Disability (i.e. Medical), which typically lasts for six weeks\nfollowed by up to an additional six weeks of bonding time. When eligible for a parental leave as a birth parent, the ShortTerm Disability (Medical) and bonding time are treated as one continuous leave for pay purposes, and leave benefits are\npaid according to the Short-Term Disability chart in the table above. Non-birthing parents must also use one week of\nPTO as the first week of their leave and will receive up to an additional five paid weeks to also provide up to six weeks of\npaid bonding time in total with leave benefits paid according to the Caregiver Leave chart in the table above. Birthing team members that do not meet the eligibility requirements for parental leave, may be eligible for medical/shortterm disability leave at the time of birth until medically released by their healthcare provider. ***Paid parental leave may also qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection.***\n\n**COMMISSION BASED TEAM MEMBERS**\n\nLeave pay for team members paid on a commission basis will be based on a team member’s basic monthly earnings. Commissions shall be averaged for the 24 months that are prior to the date the leave began. If employed less than months, the commissions shall be averaged for the total number of months employed. Any commission payments that\ncontinue after the leave begins cannot be considered as part of the basic monthly earnings. Commissions do not\ninclude arbitrary commissions not directly related to the team member’s production. Team members will be eligible to\nreceive any net commissions earned during the period of disability in excess of the basic monthly earnings.

Advance notice of military service is required, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it is\notherwise impossible or unreasonable. If a team member is called to service in the military, or must attend military training, and he/she earns less in the\nmilitary, Old National will pay the difference between their regular salary and the amount paid by the government for\nup to 18 months. Although we are not required by law to pay this difference, we are proud to do so as a way of\nshowing our support for our team members who serve our country in the uniformed services. If a team member has\nunused Paid Time Off (PTO) when the leave begins, and the team member will not return from leave prior to the new\ncalendar year, the team member has the option to be paid for any unused PTO when the leave begins or at the end\nof the year.

Qualifying exigencies may include, but are not limited to, short\nnotice deployment, military events, childcare, and post-deployment activities.

Military Exigency Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave plan design for\npay purposes. **MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE**\n\nOld National provides paid military caregiver leave to eligible team members. The leave enables an eligible team\nmember to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (“nearest blood\nrelative”) who is a covered service member. Paid military caregiver leaves may also qualify for FMLA and/or state\nlaw protection. Except for the leave duration, Military Caregiver Leave will follow the Caregiver Leave\nplan design for pay purposes. ##### Personal Leave\n\nOld National provides leaves of absence without pay to eligible team members who wish to take time off from work\nduties to fulfill obligations other than qualifying FMLA events such as, visiting family in a foreign country, or a mission\ntrip. Additionally, team members that do not meet the service requirements for paid leave for their own medical\ncondition, caregiver, or parental leave may be eligible for a personal leave.

If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single\nextension of no more than 30 consecutive calendar days per supervisor approval. Requests for personal leave will be\nevaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the\nproposed period of absence. Team members granted leave will be required to take all available Paid Time Off (PTO)\nbefore going into an unpaid status. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the team member to the same position, if it\nis available, or to a similar available position for which the team member is qualified. However, Old National cannot\nguarantee reinstatement in all cases since personal leave does not qualify for FMLA protection. ##### Worker’s Compensation Insurance\n\nOld National provides a comprehensive workers’ compensation insurance program at no cost to team members. This\nprogram covers any injury or illness sustained during the course and scope of employment that requires medical,\nsurgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements and approval, workers’ compensation insurance\nprovides disability income and medical coverage for work related injuries or illnesses. ---\n\nSubject to state workers’ compensation laws, neither Old National nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the\npayment of workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that occur during a team member’s voluntary participation in\nany off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by Old National. This includes volunteer activities during\nnormal working hours as part of the paid Volunteer Time program. ## Your Pay\n\nUnderstanding the components of your pay is important to you. In this section, the details of how time is tracked,\nas well as information on deductions and overtime is discussed. ##### Deductions\n\nThe law requires that Old National make certain deductions from every team member’s compensation. Among these\nare applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Old National must also deduct Social Security taxes on each\nteam member’s earnings up to the Social Security “wage base.” Old National matches the amount of Social Security\ntaxes paid by each team member. Old National offers additional programs and benefits. Team members authorize deductions from their pay checks\nto cover the costs of participation in these programs. Forms to change certain deductions are available on the\nCompany’s Intranet by navigating to HR & L&D > Forms. Sometimes involuntary deductions are taken by Old National, usually to pay off a debt or obligation, when required by\nfederal or state agencies. Team members are encouraged to maintain a satisfactory credit record to ensure that these\ndeductions are not required. Confidential credit counseling services are available through Old National’s Employee\nAssistance Program and may be available through other Credit Counseling Agencies located in your local community. If you have questions concerning deductions made from your paycheck or how they were calculated, contact HR\nShared Services. ##### Overdrafts\n\nAs a team member of Old National, you are encouraged to maintain your banking relationship with us. Our expectation\nis that you will maintain your account in good status. Therefore, we encourage you to consider Overdraft Protection for\nyour checking account(s) to cover inadvertent overdrafts. To sign up for Overdraft Protection, please contact Client Care or visit your local banking center. If you choose not to\nenroll in Overdraft Protection, overdraft decisions will be made according to Overdraft Courtesy guidelines. Team\nmembers with accounts that are overdrawn or with overdrafts that exceed Overdraft Protection coverage will be\nreviewed as part of the Company’s overall internal control procedures. Certain government regulations place overdraft restrictions on certain executive officers. These restrictions include the\namount an account can be overdrawn, the length of time an account can be overdrawn and prohibits the waiving of\noverdraft fees. The restrictions identified within the regulations supersede any internal policy regarding overdrafts for\nthose individuals governed by this regulation.

{"text": "Overtime will be paid to non-exempt team members who work more than 40 hours during a week, which is defined as\nSunday through Saturday, at the rate of one and one-half times the team member’s regular base rate. Overtime\ncompensation is paid to all non-exempt team members in accordance with federal and state, wage, and hour\nrestrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time off for holidays, PTO, or any leave of absence will\nnot be considered hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. Overtime must always be approved in advance by the team member’s supervisor. However, if a non-exempt team\nmember does not obtain pre-approval, the time must still be treated as work time. If a team member continues to work\novertime without proper approval or fails to work requested overtime, it may result in disciplinary action. Holiday premium pay is applicable to full and part time non-exempt team members. You will be paid one and one-half\ntimes your regular hourly rate for all hours worked on holidays observed by your office, in addition to receiving your\nregular holiday pay. If you work on a holiday, input the hours worked into Old National’s timekeeping system as normal\nin/out entries. ##### Pay Corrections\n\nOld National takes all reasonable steps to ensure that team members receive the correct amount of pay in each\npaycheck and that team members are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. If there is an error in the amount of pay, the team member should promptly notify HR Shared Services so that the\ndiscrepancy can be reviewed. If the Company identifies the error, the team member will be contacted immediately,\nand the appropriate adjustment will be made as quickly as possible. Payroll corrections will normally be made with\nthe next scheduled paycheck date immediately following the error. If a team member’s paycheck has been lost in the mail and it has been more than five business days, please contact\nHR Shared Services for instructions. ##### Paydays\n\nAll team members are paid bi-weekly with each payroll period ending at the end of the team member’s normal shift on\nSaturday. For hourly team members, each pay advice will include earnings for all work performed through the end of\nthe previous payroll week. For salaried team members, each pay advice includes earnings for all work performed\nthrough the end of the week for the current payroll period. The normal payday for all team members is Friday. The\nCompany allows two options for team members to receive their bi-weekly pay. *Team members may either elect direct\ndeposit into an Old National account or choose to be paid by check. ( **Excluding the Minnesota Region* ). All Old National team members are eligible for three FREE personal checking accounts. This benefit applies to\ntraditional personal checking accounts only, and the team member must be a single or joint owner of the account. ---\n\n##### Severance Pay\n\nOld National provides severance pay to eligible team members whose employment is terminated because of a job\nelimination. The purpose of severance pay is to minimize the financial hardship that might occur when team members\nexperience job loss through no fault of their own. Severance benefits and the eligibility requirements are detailed in the\n[**Severance Pay Summary Plan Description**](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)[.](https://www.oldnational.com/globalassets/onb-site/onb-documents/onb-about-us/onb-team-member-handbook/onb-severance-pay-plan-summary-plan-description-june-2023.pdf)\n\n##### Timekeeping\n\nIt is the responsibility of every non-exempt team member to accurately record time worked. Federal and state laws\nrequire Old National to keep an accurate record of time worked to calculate team member pay and benefits. Time\nworked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Non-exempt team members should accurately record their time worked daily. Non-exempt team members must\naccurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal\nperiod. They should also record the hours of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. Salaried nonexempt team members must accurately record any deviations to their standard schedule. Misrepresenting or falsifying timekeeping or recording time for another team member may result in disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination of employment. It is the team member’s responsibility to enter their time to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The supervisor will\nreview and approve the time record before submitting it for payroll processing.

{"text": "The supervisor will\nreview and approve the time record before submitting it for payroll processing. A team member’s workday, in general, begins when the team member commences their job duties and ends when they\nhave ceased performing job duties.

Team members\nparticipating in these procedures would be able to use the mobile app to clock in or out from the parking lot to capture\ntheir accurate time worked. Those team members that are not part of opening and closing procedures may use the\nmobile app to clock in when at their workstation ready to begin work or clock out when at their workstation done with\ntheir work. Instructions and policies related to timekeeping can be found in MyHR. ***Note: Intranet sites are only accessible from within the Old National Network.***\n\n##### Travel Time\n\nOrdinary travel from home to work is not counted as hours worked. Non-exempt team members required to travel out\nof town for business-related matters will be paid for all hours worked. Additionally, hours worked include time spent\ntraveling to or home from the out-of-town business location (e.g., in a car, in an airplane). Other time spent out of town\nfor business travel, such as time in hotel for overnight stays and meals, are not considered hours worked. ##### Advances\n\nOld National does not provide pay advances on earned or unearned wages to team members, prior to the team\nmember’s scheduled payment date, unless otherwise stated in an existing employment agreement. ---\n\n##### Pay Transparency\n\nOld National will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against team members or applicants because they\nhave inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another team member or applicant. However,\nteam members who have access to the compensation information of other team members or applicants as a part of\ntheir essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other team members or applicants to individuals who do not\notherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or\ncharge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by\nthe employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor’s legal duty to furnish information. ## Your Conduct\n\nTo ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Old National expects team members\nto follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and the organization. In this\nsection of the Team Member Handbook, you’ll learn what’s expected of you in terms of your behavior on and off the\njob as well as specifics on how to handle problems in the workplace. ##### Absenteeism\n\nAs part of the Old National team, you are expected to be conscientious about your attendance and punctuality. The success of your department or banking center depends on the contributions of each team member; when you’re\nnot working, it places an extra burden on your co-workers and may affect service to internal and external clients. **PLANNED ABSENCES**\n\nYou must obtain approval from your manager in advance of any planned absences or in accordance with the\nestablished guidelines in your department or banking center. By scheduling in advance, it allows your department or\nbanking center to appropriately plan for your time off to continue efficient service to customers and manage workloads. **UNPLANNED ABSENCES**\n\nUnscheduled absences, late arrivals, or early departures are those for which you do not receive prior approval from\nyour manager. Such absences place a burden on your co-workers and may cause efficiency and customer service to\nsuffer. If you’re going to be absent, late, or need to leave early, you must contact your manager no later than your\nnormal starting time that day or in accordance with the established guidelines in your department or banking center. **EXCESSIVE ABSENTEEISM**\n\nOld National recognizes that occasionally you may be ill, injured, or unable to work because of an illness in your\nimmediate family. Excessive absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, can cause significant business\ninterruption. Any team member who fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days or more without notifying a\nmember of their leadership team is considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily terminated their\nemployment with Old National. ---\n\nManagers are responsible for monitoring attendance-related issues on a case-by-case basis and taking corrective\naction, if required. ***Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action.***\n\n##### Team Member Conduct and Behavior\n\nEach team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual\nrespect and trust.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0023", "char_span": [113716, 118710], "sentence_count": 27, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0022", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0024", "keywords": ["team", "your", "their", "members", "time"], "policy_tags": ["MEAL", "REST"], "hash_64": "29ed9d075f636e39", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.953952", "token_count": 987}}
{"text": "***Absences protected under federal, state, or local laws are not subject to corrective action.***\n\n##### Team Member Conduct and Behavior\n\nEach team member is responsible for working with others to create a professional environment founded in mutual\nrespect and trust. Our interactions with others, whether with team members, clients, vendors, or people in the\ncommunities we serve will reflect Old National's values and the appreciation we have for each other's contribution and\nperspective. In the context of this handbook, it isn't possible to list all the forms of conduct that are considered\nunacceptable in the workplace. Instead, we expect team members to use good judgment and common sense in\nsustaining a civil and respectful work environment. The Company's values serve as a benchmark for what is\nacceptable and what is not, and the company maintains sole discretion in the decision as to what is inappropriate. An\nindividual's conduct is not acceptable solely because the person believes it to be. Nor may a team member excuse\ntheir conduct because this handbook doesn't specifically prohibit objectionable behavior. Old National expects that\nteam members recognize that inappropriate conduct, from acts of dishonesty to intimidating or belittling others, is not\nacceptable. Several sections of this Handbook, such as Confidential Information, Business Ethics and Conduct,\nConflicts of interest, Absenteeism, Sexual Harassment and Unlawful Harassment and more, speak to the standards of\nbehavior expected of all team members. Refer to relevant sections of the Handbook for more information on specific\ntopics or contact your manager or a Human Resource Representative for more information. Team members are expected to report to any Corporate Security Officer, a Talent team member, HR Shared Services,\ntheir manager, or use the PSAR/SAR process on the Old National Intranet Homepage, all known or suspected criminal\nactivities affecting the Corporation, its customers, or team members. Withholding information or knowledge of criminal\nactivity may be cause for prosecution. ***Team members may report any suspicious activity by calling the toll-free hotline 866-ETHICSP.***\n\nThis hotline may be used anonymously, if the team member wishes, and without fear of reprisal. **The following are examples of some of the infractions or conduct that may result in disciplinary action,**\n**up to and including termination of employment. This list is not exhaustive, and Old National expects all**\n**team members to exercise sound judgment and personal responsibility for their actions and behavior:**\n\n- Acts of dishonesty such as theft, fraud, embezzlement, check kiting operation, misuse of Company credit cards,or other financial crimes. - Falsification of company records. - Working under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. - Irresponsible, negligent, or improper handling of company assets including systems, email, confidentialinformation, etc. - Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or controlled substances in the workplace,while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment. - Engaging in violent acts or threatening conduct. ---\n\n- Failure to meet behavior and performance expectations and/or training expectations for your role. - Failure to cooperate in Company investigations of workplace misconduct. - Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct. - Sexual or other unlawful harassment. Employment with Old National is at the mutual consent of Old National and the team member, and either party may\nterminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. ##### Dress Guidelines\n\nCreating a positive first impression paves the way for establishing good relationships. Often the impression you create\nis influenced by the way you present yourself, including your attire. At Old National, we follow a “dress for your day” approach. This means appropriate dress can vary from business to\ncasual. What is appropriate for each team member on a given day should be dictated by their role and the interaction\nthey expect to have with customers, fellow team members and others outside Old National on that day. Please consider your daily schedule when choosing your attire. Even if your circumstances allow for casual clothing,\nplease remember that your attire is a reflection on you and on Old National. ##### Drug and Alcohol Use\n\nIt is Old National’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthy, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, team members\nare required to report to work in an appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory\nmanner. While on Old National premises or while conducting business related activities away from Old National premises, no\nteam member may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The legal use of\nprescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair a team member’s ability to perform the essential\nfunctions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment,\nand/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0024", "char_span": [118710, 124068], "sentence_count": 37, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0023", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0025", "keywords": ["team", "this", "that", "national", "your"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT", "REST"], "hash_64": "39cd88474f636e73", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.958650", "token_count": 1024}}

As part of this commitment, Old National encourages a candid and receptive atmosphere in which any\nproblem, complaint, question, or suggestion may be discussed, and a timely response provided from your supervisor\nand/or a member of the HR Talent team. **This Policy is intended to:**\n\n- Provide the opportunity to resolve work-related conflict or complaints at an early stage and addressmisunderstandings that may cause a communication breakdown. - Improve communication and understanding between team members and between team membersand their supervisor. - Promote flexible, creative solutions. **Team members should use this Policy to:**\n\n- Discuss concerns about difficulties you may be experiencing with coworkers or a supervisor. - Address established rules of conduct, policies, practices, or a decision that affects the terms and conditionsof your employment. Old National strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members, and everyone is expected to treat each\nother with mutual respect. If your supervisor does not resolve your issue, or you are concerned about retaliation, you may contact your next level\nsupervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services. In the event your issue is not resolved by your\nnext level supervisor, Talent Manager or Talent Partner, or HR Shared Services, the team member has the ability to\ndiscuss it with a representative of Senior Management up to and including the appropriate department or line of\nbusiness Executive for final resolution. A Talent Manager or Talent Partner will assist the team member, if requested,\nin the escalation of the problem to Senior Management. Not every problem can be resolved to everyone’s total satisfaction, but through understanding and discussion of\nmutual problems, team members and management can develop confidence in each other to move forward. This\nconfidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment. ***Complaints or concerns may also be shared anonymously through EthicsPoint.***\n\nOld National does not tolerate retaliation for good faith reports of ethical violations, misconduct, problems, complaints,\nor for using the problem resolution procedure. ---\n\n##### Corrective Action\n\nEvery team member’s contribution is important to Old National’s success. Both our external and internal clients depend\non a consistent level of excellence in their interactions with team members. The Company believes that everyone is\nresponsible for their performance and behavior and expects each team member to meet the expectations for their\nposition. And we believe that open, honest, and direct communication is critical to the success of each team member\nand Old National. Our corrective action process is intended to foster team member success by identifying\nunacceptable performance and the cause(s) of the unacceptable performance, agreeing on method(s) for improving\nperformance to an acceptable level, and preventing recurrence. In most cases, if you have a performance or behavior issue, your manager will work with you to provide appropriate\nperformance counseling and corrective action so that you have the opportunity to improve. However, our corrective\naction process is not necessarily progressive. This means a manager does not have to use levels of corrective action\nconsecutively. Managers reserve the right to take the level of corrective action that is appropriate for the situation and,\nif necessary, to terminate employment without implementing performance counseling and corrective action. **The level of performance counseling and corrective action depends on considerations such as:**\n\n- The nature, circumstances, and severity of the issue(s)\n\n- Timing and frequency of previous issues\n\n- The team member’s overall performance\n\nCorrective action options include a verbal, written or final warning, suspension, or termination of employment. Additionally, during the corrective action process, there may be times when Old National determines that it is\nappropriate for you to be out of the workplace, and you may be placed on administrative leave.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0025", "char_span": [124068, 129688], "sentence_count": 33, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0024", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0026", "keywords": ["team", "corrective", "action", "that", "your"], "policy_tags": ["WARN"], "hash_64": "31c598474f676e39", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.963320", "token_count": 1010}}
{"text": "Additionally, during the corrective action process, there may be times when Old National determines that it is\nappropriate for you to be out of the workplace, and you may be placed on administrative leave. The Company is\ncommitted to ensuring that performance counseling and corrective action is timely, transparent, and impartial. Because facts and circumstances can vary widely and are often unique to a particular situation, the action that’s\ntaken in one situation shouldn’t be interpreted as setting standard for any other situations. Team members are responsible for actively engaging in the corrective action process and taking appropriate action(s)\nto improve their performance or behavior. This may include preparing a plan outlining actions to improve performance,\ncommitments, and follow-up. Old National believes that this corrective action process can help to resolve performance and conduct problems at an\nearly stage. ##### Security Inspections\n\nOld National will maintain a work environment that is free of controlled substances and related paraphernalia, alcohol,\nfirearms, explosives, or other improper materials such as weapons and sexually explicit materials. Old National\nprohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises. In some states, there are additional\nlaws about this subject; when applicable, state law takes precedence over these guidelines. Desks, lockers, and other storage devices may be provided for the convenience of team members but remain the sole\nproperty of Old National. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or\nrepresentative of Old National at any time, either with or without prior notice. ---\n\n##### Solicitation\n\nTo ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by Old National may not solicit or\ndistribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose. Old National recognizes that team members may have interest in events and organizations outside the workplace. Solicitation and distribution of literature are prohibited during business hours. Distribution of literature is prohibited in\nwork areas at all times. ONB Classifieds located on Viva Engage is the official site for posting any items that you are\noffering for sale or wish to purchase. In the case of recognized organizations, such as United Way, your assistance may be solicited by your supervisor or\nappropriate member of management. Contributions are voluntary and made on a private and personal basis. While\ngiving is encouraged, it is not expected. Old National maintains bulletin boards to communicate Company information to team members and to post notices\nrequired by law. These bulletin boards are for the posting of Company information and notices only, and only people\ndesignated by Human Resources may place notices on or take down material from the bulletin boards. The\nunauthorized posting of notices, photographs, or other printed or written materials on bulletin boards or any other\nCompany property is prohibited. ## Important Policies\n\nIn this section, you’ll learn about Old National’s policies such as the Information Users Acknowledgment, Emergency\nClosings and many more. ##### Emergency Closings\n\nEmergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or earthquakes, can disrupt company operations. The\nnature of our business requires us to continue to operate regardless of conditions that might otherwise close other\nbusinesses. Old National is committed to the safety and well-being of all team members and will take appropriate steps\nto make sure team members feel safe when continuing business operations during emergency conditions including\npermitting team members to perform work from home when possible. The following guidelines explain various scenarios and how the company will pay you when an emergency scenario\noccurs. **If your business, branch, or department closes during your working hours:**\nIn extreme cases, when inclement weather conditions or another emergency situation develops during the day,\nmanagement may decide to close all or part of its business operations. - All team members who are instructed to leave early as a result of closed operations will be paid for their normallyscheduled hours that day. Team members who are in a role that work can be performed remotely (home or\nanother ONB location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on\ndetermining a remote location to work. - Team members may be asked to work on a day when their department is officially closed. In these circumstances,non-exempt team members who work will receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times the team member’s base\nrate of pay. Please contact HR Shared Services for assistance regarding the proper coding of the time. ---\n\n**If your business, branch, or department is open for the day:**\nIf inclement weather or other emergency conditions exist, team members should report to work, unless they have been\nadvised by phone, radio, or other means that the business will be closed for the day.

It is our policy to pay team members for their regularly scheduled hours\nunder these conditions. Team members who are in a role that can be performed remotely (home or another ONB\nlocation) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on determining a remote\nlocation to work. **Pay Practices**\nTeam members may be paid their regular pay for up to one week of emergency closure pay per calendar year if they\nare unable to perform their job duties from a remote setting. If emergency closures exceed one week per year,\nexecutive leaders will review to determine if additional emergency close pay is warranted. All emergency close pay will be recorded using the Emergency Closing (EMC) pay code for regular hours or the\nEmergency Closing Shift (EMS) pay code for shift hours. Emergency Closing Pay will not count as hours worked for\novertime purposes. Please contact HR Shared Services if you have any questions concerning the above. ##### Ergonomics\n\nOld National makes every effort in providing a safe and healthy work environment for all team members. Work-related\nrepetitive motion injuries (RMIs) are caused by repeated motions and exertions when performing a job, process or\noperation and are diagnosed by a licensed physician. The disorder can involve nerves, tendons, muscles and\nsupporting structure of the musculoskeletal system. Examples of repetitive motion tasks include, but are not limited to,\nsustained computer keyboard and mouse usage or lifting, carrying and loading objects.

The success of this program depends on active participation by all\nof us. Team members are encouraged to make a commitment to recycle and be a part of this solution. Many Old\nNational locations provide special recycling receptacles to promote the separation and collection of recyclable\nmaterials.

That commitment is jeopardized when any team member illegally uses drugs at\nhome or at work, comes to work under their influence, possesses, distributes, or sells drugs in the workplace, or\nabuses alcohol on the job. This conduct is inconsistent with the behavior expected of team members, subjects all team\nmembers and visitors to our facilities to unacceptable safety risks, and undermines Old National Bancorp’s ability to\noperate effectively and efficiently. As part of Old National Bancorp’s commitment to safeguard the well-being of its team members and to provide a safe\nenvironment for everyone, Old National Bancorp has established the following drug-free workplace policy:\n\n- It is a violation of this policy for any team member to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegaldrugs or drug paraphernalia or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md", "company": "Old National Bank", "source_url": "", "org": "General Business", "industry": "HR/Employee", "doc_type": "handbook", "doc_title": "Old National Bank", "doc_year": "unknown", "section_path": "Unknown", "section_title": "Unknown", "section_index": "", "chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0029", "char_span": [145617, 150361], "sentence_count": 21, "content_type": "text", "prev_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0028", "next_chunk_id": "Finance_Old_National_Bank.md_chunk_0030", "keywords": ["team", "will", "national", "chief", "sexual"], "policy_tags": ["HARASSMENT"], "hash_64": "288db84747676e71", "created_at": "2025-10-23T16:07:05.979993", "token_count": 994}}
