The Handbook describes\nmany of your responsibilities as a team member and outlines the programs we have developed to benefit our\nteam members. One of our objectives at Buchheit is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both\npersonal and professional growth.\n\nNo team member handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about every one of our policies.\nFurther, there may be situations where the need arises for us to revise, add, or cancel policies. Therefore,\nBuchheit reserves the right to add new policies, and to change or cancel existing policies at any time. The\nonly exception is that our employment-at-will policy will not be changed or cancelled. The employment-atwill policy permits you or Buchheit to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. We will\nnotify you of any changes to the Handbook as they occur.\n\n###### Purpose of Handbook\n\nThe contents of this handbook are not intended to create a contract between Buchheit and any or all of its\nteam members. Rather, this handbook is provided only for the purpose of providing general information\nabout the company and its policies.\n\nBuchheit reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change any or all such plans, policies or\nprocedures, in whole or in part, anytime with or without notice. Nothing herein is intended to create any type\nof contract or guarantee of continued employment. Your employment with Buchheit is at will and may be\ndiscontinued with or without reason, with or without advance notice.\n\n###### The Buchheit Story\n\nIn 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Rudy Buchheit started hauling livestock to market for local\nfarmers. No superhighways, no GPS units - just Rudy, his truck, and his determination to feed his family.\n\nTo make the most of each trip, Rudy began hauling goods back on his return trip. Turned out folks back\nhome had a hard time laying hands on such merchandise. So, Rudy’s efforts were an immediate hit, and\nBuchheit Trucking was born.\n\nSeveral million miles later, Buchheit has become the #1 independent logistics corporation in the region with\na network connecting continents around the globe.\n\nThe Buchheit name is also known as a trustworthy source for agricultural supplies. Buchheit retail stores\noffer a wide variety of home and farm products across the Midwest.\n\nYet in spite of our success, we’ve never forgotten the simple principles that drove Rudy back in 1934: get it\nthere on time, get it there in good condition, and get it there for a fair price. We call it “ ***Rudy’s way*** .” And no\nmatter how much farther down the road we go, we’ll never lose sight of it.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_9_0.png)\n\n###### Customer Relations\n\nCustomers are Buchheit's most valuable assets. Each team member represents Buchheit to our Customers\nand the public. The way we do our jobs presents an image of our entire organization. Customers judge us by\nhow they are treated each time they have contact with us. Therefore, one of our top business priorities is to\nassist any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, helpful,\nand prompt in the attention you give to customers. This applies to internal, as well as external, customers.\n\nBuchheit will provide customer relations and services training to all team members who have extensive\ncustomer contact. If a customer wishes to make a specific comment or complaint, you should direct that\nperson to the Manager on Duty for appropriate action. Remember that your contacts with the public in\nperson, over the telephone, and through all your communications reflect, not only on you, but on Buchheit as\na whole. Positive customer relations will not only enhance the public's image of Buchheit, but also pay off in\ngreater customer loyalty and increased sales and profit.\n\n###### Buchheit Logistics, Our Promise\n\nAt Buchheit, we understand our customers have a choice when it comes to a logistics partner. And we\nunderstand just how much they have riding on their decision. That’s why we make this promise to our\ncustomers: Each and every day we commit to their success. From the first mile to the last, we will stand\nwith them to ensure that their products are cared for and delivered to their intended destination on time,\nas promised. And, if for any reason they are ever dissatisfied, we will spare no effort to make it right.\n\nThanks for allowing us to serve our customers.\n\nSincerely,\n*The Buchheit Logistics Team*\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_10_0.png)\n\n###### A Letter from Rudy\n\nI am pleased that you have decided to join us here at Buchheit! A lot of hard work and long hours have been put into our business to\nmake it what it is today. I hope that you take the kind of pride in your job at Buchheit as my family, fellow team members, and myself\nhave taken through the years. We have worked together as a close team for many years, and that has made us what we are today.\n\nI would like to tell you a little about what it was like when I started Buchheit and how it evolved into what it is today. In 1934, the\ndepression years, I was driving a truck, hauling livestock, gravel, hay, lumber, and whatever type of loads I could get. This meant\nloading and unloading the truck by myself and scooping gravel from the creek beds. I felt fortunate to have an eighth-grade education\nduring these times. After two years of hauling, the building in which the original store stood was for sale. I did not have the money to\nbuy it, and it belonged to an estate, so the people who owned it financed the building for me. They trusted that I would pay for it, so I\ndid not have to make a down payment. My monthly payments were $25.\n\nMy father-in-law furnished $200 for the first merchandise that I bought. I paid him back by hauling cattle to market. Some of my first\ninventory included 50-gallon barrels of salted herring, 25-lb. and 50-lb. bags of flour, 100-lb. bags of sugar, and 280-lb. barrels of\nsalt, and 100-lb. bags of beans. We had coffee that we weighed and ground by hand. There was also rice and prunes sold in bulk.\nLater, I sold feed in floral print bags. Ladies would come in on Sundays after church and pick out their favorite print, which they\nwould use to sew clothes for themselves and their children. I can recall several people walking as far as five miles to trade with me.\nThey would carry baskets full of eggs that I would buy. In return, they would fill their baskets with goods they bought from me.\n\nBack then, personalized service meant a lot to my customers, as it still does today. Since there was no advertising, the quality of\nservice was the best way to keep my customers loyal. By word of mouth, people began to learn of my business here.\n\nIn the beginning, I lived in the top of the store. In winter, it would get so cold, the soda bottles would freeze. In the summer, we would\nopen the doors to the stores for a breeze. However, outside was a dirt road, and the dust was so bad, it was almost better to leave the\ndoors shut.\n\nI didn't have many employees - one or two. Many days, I would run the cash register, load customers in the yard, and talk to\nsalespeople. Things would get kind of hectic. During the evenings, I would still haul livestock to St. Louis, rent a bed in a rooming\nhouse to sleep for a few hours, and come back home. I worked many 24-hour days.\n\nA salesperson would call me every two weeks. I would order my supplies and would have to pay cash for what I needed right then.\nWhen people would ask for an item, I would try to get it in stock. By filling my customers' needs, I built my inventory up to a business\nwith a reputation that, \"we have everything you need.\"\n\nIf you have noticed, our emblem is a wagon wheel. This represents how teamwork is necessary for progress. The hub, or the center of\nthe wheel, can be viewed as team members pulling together to get things done, just as the hub holds the spokes together so the wheel\ncan be put into motion. If one spoke is missing, the wheel cannot work. The same is true for our business. If someone does not\ncontribute as a team member, our business cannot work. With teamwork, it is difficult to run a business today; however, without\nteamwork, it is IMPOSSIBLE and will surely fail. The 11 spokes in this wheel represent each of my children.\n\nUntil the early 1960s, I never took a salary: all the profits went back into the business. I have 11 children. Putting food on the table\noften meant using the outdated groceries from the store. When I think back, it seemed to be pretty hard work at times, and you didn't\nhave much time for yourself. But, I would not have done it if I didn't enjoy it.\n\nWhen my children were big enough to start helping out, they were a big help! With their new ideas, things just seemed to keep\ngrowing. We began to buy a little grain and things in other areas. Our trucking operation expanded to meet our needs, and today, we\nare still servicing our customers with a fleet. The feed division has come a long way from the floral print bags. We now manufacture\nPremium Brand feeds for the surrounding communities and other custom feeds for a distribution network.\n\nIn running this business, I have learned many things. One is that mistakes will be made. I feel that it is important to correct these\nmistakes as they arise and to take care of our customers.\n\nOur family has worked by this motto, which has turned into our business motto:\n\n**Rule #1: The customer is always right.**\n**Rule #2: When in doubt, refer to rule #1.**\n\nNo matter what your job is here at Buchheit, it is very important that you are honest, have a positive attitude, respect the company, and\nrespect the inventory, equipment, and the company's customers. These are the main contributions that make your paycheck possible.\n\nI am proud of the history of our company and of the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire Buchheit team. I want you to\ntake pride in your job and enjoy being part of this team.\n\n## Rudy Buchheit\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_11_0.png)\n\n###### Mission, Vision, Values\n\n## MISSION :\n\nOur Mission is to attract and retain customers by providing best-in-class, full-service logistics solutions\nby becoming an integral part of their strategy by driving out cost and adding value.

We have found that having an introductory period can\nbe very helpful to new team members. The introductory period provides you with the opportunity to\ndemonstrate that you can perform your job at a satisfactory level of performance and to determine if the new\njob meets your expectations. We use this period to evaluate your capabilities, work habits, and overall\nperformance.\n\nSince employment at Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit may end the employment\nrelationship at will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance\nnotice.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_20_0.png)\n\nThe introductory period for all new and rehired team members is the first 90 calendar days after the date of\nhire. If there is a significant period of absence during the introductory period, the period will automatically\nbe extended by the length of the absence. Either during the introductory period, or at the end of the period,\nwe may extend the introductory period if we determine there was not adequate time to evaluate performance.\n\nWhen the introductory period is satisfactorily completed, team members enter the \"regular\" employment\nclassification.\n\nDuring the introduction period, new team members are eligible for legally required benefits, such as workers'\ncompensation insurance and Social Security.\n\nAfter becoming regular team members, they may also be eligible for other Buchheit benefit programs,\nsubject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program.

If you have concerns\nabout work conditions or compensations, you are strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and\ndirectly to your supervisor.\n\nOur experience has shown that when team members deal openly and directly with management, the work\nenvironment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that\nBuchheit amply demonstrates its commitment to team members by responding effectively to team member\nconcerns. Because we want to maintain direct employer/team member communications, we do not believe\nour team members need an outside party to speak for them and will continue to protect your right to speak\nfor yourself.\n\n###### Personal Relationships in the Workplace\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The employment of relatives of individuals involved in a dating relationship in the same area of an\norganization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and team member morale. In addition\nto claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be\ncarried over into day-to-day working relationships. This policy applies to all team members regardless of\ntheir gender or sexual orientation.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, a relative is defined as any person who is related to you by blood or marriage, or\nwhose relationship with you is similar to that of a relative. A dating relationship is defined as a relationship\nthat may be reasonably expected to lead to the formation of a consensual \"romantic\" or sexual relationship.\n\nYou may not be involved in a dating relationship with a team member who either works directly for you or\nsupervises you. Buchheit reserves the right to take prompt action if an actual or potential conflict of interest\narises involving relatives or individuals involved in a dating relationship who occupy positions at any level\n(higher or lower) in the same line of authority that might affect the review of employment decisions.\n\nIf two people who are in a reporting situation described above subsequently develop a dating relationship,\nthe person in the relationship who is the supervisor is responsible and obligated to disclose the existence of\nthe relationship to management. We will decide which one of them is to be transferred to another available\nlocation. If the team member is not willing to be transferred to another location, they may be terminated.\n\nIf there is a situation where a conflict, or the potential for conflict, arises because of the relationship between\nteam members, even if there is no line of authority or reporting involved, the team members may be\nseparated by reassignment or termination of employment. If in a close personal relationship with another\nteam member, we ask that you refrain from displays of affection or excessive personal conversation at work.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_22_0.png)\n\n###### Conflicts of Interest\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/As a team member of Buchheit, you have the obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit\nactual or potential conflicts of interest.

These guidelines are intended to provide a general direction so that you can get further\nclarification on areas that affect you. For more information or questions on conflict of interest, contact the\nCompany President or the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAn actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when a team member is in a position to influence a decision\nthat may result in a personal gain for that team member or for a relative as a result of business dealings with\nBuchheit. For the purposes of this policy, we define a relative as any person who is related by blood or\nmarriage, or whose relationship with the team member is similar to that of persons who are related by blood\nor marriage.\n\nThere is no \"presumption of guilt\" created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.\nHowever, if you have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative\nthat you disclose this fact to an officer of Buchheit as soon as possible. By alerting us to the existence of any\nactual or even a potential conflict of interest, we can establish safeguards to protect all parties.\n\nThe potential for personal gain is not limited to situations where a team member or relative has a significant\nownership in a firm with which Buchheit does business.

This is particularly true if your job involves dealing in person with\ncustomers or visitors.\n\nYour supervisor or department head is responsible for establishing a reasonable dress code appropriate to the\njob you perform. If your supervisor feels your personal appearance is inappropriate, you may be asked to\nleave work until you can return properly dressed or groomed.\n\nIf this happens, you will not be paid for the time away from work.

We use telephone monitoring to identify and correct performance problems with\ntargeted training. We are always striving for improved performance to enhance our customers' image of\nBuchheit as well as customer service satisfaction.\n\nThe computer equipment and systems and Internet access that team members may use are always the\nproperty of Buchheit. Therefore, we reserve the right to monitor computer activities. We also reserve the\nright to retrieve and read any computer files or data that are composed, sent, or received through Internet\nconnections or stored in our computer systems.\n\nWe may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. We use video monitoring to identify\nsafety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage and prevent acts of\nharassment and workplace violence.\n\nYou may request access to information gathered through workplace monitoring that may impact employment\ndecisions. We will grant access unless there is an ongoing investigation or a legitimate business reason to\nprotect confidentiality.\n\nBecause we are sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of or our team members, we will make every effort\nto guarantee that workplace monitoring is always done in an ethical and respectful manner.\n\n###### Use of Phone and Mail Systems\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit telephones are intended for business use, and team members are not permitted to make personal\nlong-distance or toll calls from our phones. We request that you keep any personal local calls to a minimum\nand may require you to reimburse Buchheit for charges resulting from personal calls.\n\nIt is not acceptable to use Buchheit postage or metering for your personal mail. The postage is intended only\nfor official business-related mail.\n\nBecause our telephone communications are an important reflection of our image to customers and the\ncommunity, every team member should use proper telephone etiquette.\n\nSome examples of good telephone etiquette are: always using the approved greeting, speaking courteously\nand professionally, confirming the information you have received from the caller, and only hanging up once\nthe caller has done so.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_40_0.png)\n\n###### Cell Phone Usage\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 1/05/Buchheit provides cellular telephones to some team members as business tools. The phones are provided to\nassist team members in communicating with management and other team members, clients, and other\nbusiness-related contacts. Cell phones are primarily intended for business-related calls. However, occasional,\nbrief personal use is permitted within reasonable limits. Buchheit will review cell phone invoices. Buchheit\nissued cell phones may include GPS tracking functionality.\n\nCompany provided cell phones will include a wall charger, all other accessories are the responsibility of the\nteam member. Further, each phone is issued for a life of two years. Team members are responsible for\nreplacement of a phone or accessories should they break and are out of the warranty period prior to being\neligible for an upgrade. If a team member prefers to upgrade his/her phone outside of the upgrade eligibility\nwindow, the charges incurred will be the responsibility of the team member. Team members are also\nresponsible for any charges that are incurred through personal application downloads or paid services.\n\nBuchheit IT will only support approved devices. These devices can be found in the approved hardware list\naccessible through an IT help desk request. Also, Buchheit IT will not support unauthorized downloaded\napplications to company provided cell phones.\n\nWhile driving, your primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. For that\nreason, we prohibit team members from using cell phones to conduct business while they are driving. You\nshould utilize a hands-free device, or safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before you dial or\ntalk on the phone.\n\nIf you use a cell phone for business, always remember to apply normal business etiquette by keeping your\nconversations private and non-disruptive to others.\n\nThe use of personal cell phones without a valid business purpose during working hours is prohibited.\n\n###### Personal Identifiable Information Policy (PII)\nIt is company policy to protect personally identifiable information (PII) of employees and contractors.\nThe electronic restrictions and safeguards outlined in this policy provide guidance for employees, and\ncontractors that have access to PII to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations.\n\n**Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as:** Any representation of information that permits\nthe identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or\nindirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual (e.g.,\nname, address, social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email\naddress, etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other\ndata elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender,\nrace, birth date, geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the\nphysical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable information.\nThis information can be maintained in either paper, electronic or other media.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_41_0.png)\n\nSome information that is considered PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, public\nwebsites, university listings, etc. This type of information is considered to be **Public PII** and includes:\n\n1. First and Last name\n2. Address\n3. Work telephone number\n4. Work e-mail address\n5. Home telephone number\n6. General educational credentials\n7. Photos and video\nIn contrast, **Protected PII** is defined as any one or more of types of information including, but not\nlimited to:\n\n1. Social security number\n2. Username and password\n3. Passport number\n4. Credit card number\n5. Clearances\n6. Banking information\n7. Biometrics\n8. Data and place of birth\n9. Mother’s maiden name\n10. Criminal, medical and financial records\n11. Educational transcripts\n12. Photos and video including any of the above\nEmployees are reminded that safeguarding sensitive information is a critical responsibility that must be\ntaken seriously at all times. Company policy specifies the following security policies for the protection\nof PII and other sensitive data:\n\n- It is the responsibility of the individual user to protect data to which they have access.\n\n- Employees having access to personal information shall respect the confidentiality of such\ninformation, and refrain from any conduct that would indicate a careless or negligent attitude\ntoward such information. Employees also shall avoid office gossip and should not permit any\nunauthorized viewing of records. Only individuals who have a \"need to know\" in their official\ncapacity shall have access to such records.\n\nThe loss of PII can result in substantial harm to individuals, including identity theft or other fraudulent\nuse of the information. Because employees may have access to personal identifiable information\nconcerning individuals and other sensitive data, we have a special responsibility to protect that\ninformation from loss and misuse. With these responsibilities employees should:\n\n- Safeguard information to which the employee has access at all times.\n\n- Obtain management's **written** approval prior to taking any sensitive information away from the\noffice. The manager's approval must identify the business necessity for removing such\ninformation from the facility.\n\n- When approval is granted to take sensitive information away from the office, the employee must\nadhere to the security policies described above.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_42_0.png)\n\nInformation System - a collection of computing resources that are accessible through privileged access\nsuch as a login or key. Usually a software package designed to store employee data.\n\nSecure Deletion - Secure deletion of an electronic file is accomplished by overwriting the full file\ncontents with random data multiple times.\n\nAll electronic files that contain Protected PII shall reside within a protected Information System. All\nphysical files that contain Protected PII will reside within a locked file cabinet or room when not being\nactively viewed or modified. Protected PII is not to be downloaded to personal or employee workstations\nor mobile devices (such as laptops, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, tablets or removable\nmedia) or to systems outside the protection of the company. PII will also not be sent through any form of\ninsecure electronic communication such as E-mail or instant messaging systems.\n\nSignificant security risks emerge when PII is transferred from a secure location to a less secure location\nor is disposed of improperly. When disposing of PII the physical or electronic file should be shredded or\nsecurely deleted.\n\nEmployees should ensure they are aware of their responsibilities regarding the protection of PII. In\naddition to the forgoing, if employees become aware of a theft or loss of PII, they are required to\n**immediately** inform management.\n\nAny employee found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action as deemed\nappropriate based on the facts and circumstances giving rise to the violation.\n\n###### Team Member Conduct and Work Rules\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, we expect you to follow rules\nof conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all team members and Buchheit.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable at work, the\nfollowing are some examples of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination of employment:\n\n- Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property\n- Falsification of timekeeping records\n- Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs\n- Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty,or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment\n\n- Fighting, threatening violence, or bullying in the workplace\n- Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace\n- Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property\n- Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct\n- Violation of safety or health rules\n- Smoking in prohibited areas\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_43_0.png)\n\n- Sexual or other unlawful of unwelcome harassment\n- Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace\n- Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice\n- Unauthorized absence from work area during the workday\n- Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment\n- Unauthorized disclosure of business \"secrets\" or confidential information\n- Violation of personnel policies\n- Unsatisfactory performance or conduct\nSince employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent, either you or Buchheit have the right to\nterminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause or advance notice, at any time.\n\n###### Problem Solving Process\nWe encourage team members to work out any problems they have with their peers and their immediate\nsupervisors on a one-to-one basis. If you believe your problem is not adequately addressed, you may take the\nproblem to any supervisor/manager in your line of authority.\n\nIf you are unable to work out problems informally, you may briefly describe the problem in writing and\nsubmit it to the corporate loss prevention department. Appropriate personnel will be assigned to look into\nthe problem and attempt to resolve it completely. Management will respond to the problem by the team\nmember’s next workday (Mon.-Fri.). If you are not satisfied with the resolution, you may discuss the\nproblem with senior corporate management.\n\nYou must call the attention of management to the problem within 30 calendar days of its occurrence. If you\nbelieve you are experiencing sexual harassment, you may raise this problem in the same manner as for any\nother problem, except that you have 180 calendar days.\n\nWhen attempting to resolve a problem in person, two company representatives or members of management\nmust be present.\n\n###### Open Door Policy\nAny applicant or employee who believes that there has been a violation of company policy or any applicable\nlaw relating to accommodating a person with a disability should immediately contact the Human Resource\nDepartment. All complaints are promptly investigated. All individuals are expected to cooperate with an\ninvestigation. The information in the course of an investigation is held in confidence and is only disclosed to\nindividuals who have a need to know.\n\n###### Progressive Discipline\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This policy describes the policy for administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory\nconduct at Buchheit. We believe that the best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to be\nenforced and comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all employment levels.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_44_0.png)\n\nWe also believe that it is in the best interests of Buchheit to ensure fair treatment of all team members and\nmake certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any\ndisciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the team member for\nsatisfactory performance in the future.\n\nAlthough your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and Buchheit have the right to\nterminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, Buchheit may use progressive\ndiscipline at its discretion.\n\nDisciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or\nwithout pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of\noccurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.\n\nProgressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be\nfollowed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning;\nanother offense may lead to a suspension; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of\nemployment.\n\nBuchheit recognizes that there are certain types of team member problems that are serious enough to justify\neither a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual\nprogressive discipline steps.\n\nWhile it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be considered a serious offense, the Employee\nConduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or\ntermination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all necessarily serious offenses, but may be\nexamples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger progressive discipline.\n\nBy using progressive discipline, we hope that most team member problems can be corrected at any early\nstage, benefiting both team members and Buchheit.\n\n###### Problem Resolution\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing the best possible working conditions for our team members. Part of this\ncommitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or\nquestion receives a timely response from Buchheit supervisors and management.\n\nBuchheit strives to ensure fair and honest treatment of all team members. We expect supervisors, managers,\nand team members to treat each other with mutual respect. We encourage team members to offer positive\nand constructive criticism to each other.\n\nIf you disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, you can express your concern\nthrough the problem resolution procedure. You will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a\ncomplaint with Buchheit in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution\nprocedure.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_45_0.png)\n\nIf a situation occurs when you believe that a condition of employment or a decision affecting you is unjust or\ninequitable, you are encouraged to make use of the following steps. You may discontinue the procedure at\nany step.\n\n1. You present the problem to your supervisor within 30 calendar days after the incident occurs. If yoursupervisor is unavailable or you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, you may present\nthe problem to the Loss Prevention Manager or any other member of management.\n\n1. The supervisor responds to the problem during discussion or within 30 calendar days after consultingwith appropriate management, when necessary. The supervisor documents the discussion.\n\n1. You present the problem to the Loss Prevention Manager within 30 calendar days if the problem isunresolved.\n\n1. The Loss Prevention Manager counsels and advises you, assists you in putting the problem in writing,visits with your supervisor/managers, if necessary, and directs you to the Director of Stores for a review\nof the problem.\n\n1. You present the problem to the Director of Stores in writing.\n2. The Director of Stores reviews and considers the problem. The Director of Stores informs you of thedecision within 30 calendar days and forwards a copy of the written response to the Loss Prevention\nManager for your file. The Director of Stores has full authority to make any adjustment deemed\nappropriate to resolve the problem.\n\nNot every problem can be resolved to everyone's total satisfaction, but only through understanding and\ndiscussion of mutual problems can team members and management develop confidence in each other. This\nconfidence is important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment and helps to\nensure everyone's job security.\n\n###### Safety\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/This program is a top priority at Buchheit. To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for\nteam members, customers, and visitors, Buchheit has established a workplace safety program. The Loss\nPrevention Department is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety\nprogram. The success of the program depends on the alertness and personal commitment of everyone.\n\nWe provide information to team members about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal\ncommunication channels. These may include supervisor-team member meetings, bulletin board postings,\nmemos, or other written communications.\n\nTeam members and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential\nsafety and health hazards, as well as safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards.\nWe also have a safety advisory group that assists in these activities and helps facilitate effective\ncommunication between team members and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\nIf you have an idea, concern, or suggestion for how to improve safety in the workplace, we encourage you to\ntell your supervisor, location manager, Safety Manager, or the Loss Prevention Manager. We want you to be\nassured that you can report any concerns about workplace safety anonymously if you wish, and you can make\na report without fear of reprisal.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_46_0.png)\n\nYou are expected to obey all safety rules and use caution in your work activities. You must immediately\nreport any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. If you violate Buchheit safety standards, cause a\nhazardous or dangerous situation, or fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, you may be\nsubject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nIn the case of an accident that results in an injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, you\nshould immediately notify the Loss Prevention Department or the appropriate supervisor. Prompt reporting\ncan ensure legal compliance and quick initiation of insurance and worker's compensation benefits\nprocedures. A post-accident drug and alcohol screen will be required.\n\n###### Workplace Violence Prevention\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. We\nhave adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual)\nviolence that might occur during business hours or on our premises.\n\nAll team members, including supervisors and temporary team members, should be treated with courtesy and\nrespect at all times. Team members are expected to refrain from fighting, \"horseplay\", or other conduct that\nmay be dangerous to others. We prohibit firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices and\nsubstances from the premises of Buchheit without proper authorization.\n\nBuchheit will not tolerate conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another team member, a customer,\nor a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods. This includes all acts of harassment,\nincluding harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, national origin, disability, religion, or\nany characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.\n\nAll threats of (or actual) violence, either direct or indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your\nsupervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by team members as well as threats by\ncustomers, vendors, solicitors, or anyone else. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific\nand detailed as possible.\n\nBe sure to report any suspicious person or activities as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place\nyourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work area, do not try to intercede\nor see what is happening.\n\nWe will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats (or actual), bullying or violence and of\nsuspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the person who made the report will be protected to the\nextent practical. To maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Buchheit may suspend a\nteam member, either with or without pay, pending investigation.\n\nAny person who violates these guidelines will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination of employment. Violations include making a threat of violence or actually committing a violent\nact.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_47_0.png)\n\nIf you are having a dispute or differences with another team member, we encourage you to discuss it with\nyour supervisor or the Loss Prevention Manager before the situation escalates into potential violence.\nBuchheit is eager to assist in the resolution of team member disputes, and we will not discipline a team\nmember for raising these types of concerns.\n\n###### Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of harassment and\ndiscrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual\nharassment. This policy applies to all employees of the company, including supervisors and non-supervisory\nemployees, and independent contractors.\n\nIn keeping with this commitment, the company maintains a strict policy prohibiting harassment or\ndiscrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental and/or physical\ndisability, national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law. This includes any form of verbal,\nnon-verbal, physical, and visual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an\nindividual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other\nlegally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. We provide ongoing sexual harassment training to\nensure you the opportunity to work in an environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment.\n\nMoreover, it is the policy of the company to prevent and prohibit misconduct on the job, including\nsexual harassment or any other type of harassment or discrimination by co-workers, other employees,\nincluding supervisors, and persons doing business with or for the company.\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other offensive conduct of a sexual nature do not\nbelong in the workplace. In addition, a hostile or offensive work environment caused by remarks or actions\nbased on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, gender, age, marital status, veteran status, sexual\norientation, any physical or mental disability or any other classification that is protected under applicable\nlaw, will not be condoned or permitted. Such conduct could constitute harassment, which is not only a\nviolation of Company policy, but also violate the law.\n\nIt is important to remember that actions or comments you may consider to be innocent or harmless may be\nconsidered offensive physical or verbal harassment by another employee, driver, or contractor. In addition,\nunder some circumstances, a violation of the Company’s E-Mail, Internet, and Mobilecomm Policy may also\nconstitute harassment.\n\nIf an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical\nharassment, or there are other interpersonal issues which compromise the working environment, or which\ncreate discord or distractions that interfere with your safety and productivity, the driver should immediately\nnotify his or her supervisor, or contact the Human Resources Department, so that the company may\ninvestigate the situation. If an employee or independent contractor believes he or she is being subjected to\nverbal or physical harassment during training, the employee should immediately contact his or her supervisor\nto inform them of the situation.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_48_0.png)\n\nAll complaints will be treated as confidentially as possible and will be investigated by the Company. No\nassociate will suffer retaliation or intimidation as a result of the good faith, honest use of this internal\ncomplaint procedure.\n\nWhen a violation of this policy is determined to have occurred, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination of employment/contract, will be taken. This policy is not intended to create any type\nof contract between the company and any associate, and this policy is subject to review and/or modification\nby the company at any time.\n\nHarassment and/or discrimination may take many forms including but not limited to:\nA) Any discriminatory or harassing action based on one’s protected characteristic (race, citizenship,\ncolor, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, and/or disability) that has the purpose or effect of\nunreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or adversely effecting an\nindividual’s employment opportunities.\nB) Such verbal, non-verbal, discriminatory, or harassing actions that create a hostile work environment.\nThese may include but are not limited to:\n`o`\nVerbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or unwanted sexual advances,\ninvitations, or comments.\n`o`\nVisual conduct such as derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings, or gestures.\n`o`\nPhysical conduct such as assault, blocking normal movement, or interference with work, when\ndirected at an individual.\nD) Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, threats or demands to submit to sexual requests in\norder to keep a job or avoid some other loss and offers of job benefits in return for sexual favors\n(“Quid Pro Quo”).\nE) Retaliation for having reported harassment or discrimination.\n\nSexual harassment may include:\nA) Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct\nof a sexual nature as a condition of an employees’ employment; or\nB) Making submissions to/or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the\nemployee; or\nC) Threatening, directly or indirectly, to retaliate against an employee, if the employee refuses to\ncomply with a sexually oriented request; or\nD) Engaging in sexually suggestive physical contact or touching another employee in a way that is\nunwelcome; or\nE) Displaying, storing, discussing, or transmitting pornographic or sexually oriented materials using the\ncompany or personal equipment or facilities while driving for the company.\nF) Engaging in indecent exposure; or\nG) Creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\nSexual harassment can be physical and/or psychological in nature. An aggregation of a series of\nincidents can constitute sexual harassment even if one of the incidents considered on its own would not\nbe harassing. Employees and independent contractors are prohibited from harassing other employees or\nindependent contractors whether or not the incidents of harassment occur on any company premises or\ncompany owned/leased equipment, or customer facilities and whether or not the incidents occur during\nworking hours. Sexual harassment can involve males/females being harassed by members of either sex.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_49_0.png)\n\nAlthough sexual harassment typically involves co-workers, it can also include third parties, such as\ncustomers or suppliers. It is imperative that you immediately report any behavior, which you deem to be\nsexually harassing so the company can take immediate action and investigate the complaint.\n\n***Team Member Responsibilities:***\nIf employee or independent contractor believes that they have been subject to sexual harassment or any\nunwanted sexual attention, they should:\n\n- Make their unease and/or disapproval directly and immediately known to the harasser;\n- Make a written record of the date, time, and nature of the incident (s) and the names of any witness;and\n\n- Report the incident to their supervisor or directly to the Human Resources Department.\nThe company encourages drivers to communicate effectively with each other and resolve issues that\narise on the truck by themselves. However, all incidents of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual\nconduct must be reported, regardless of their seriousness. Publicizing information about alleged\nharassment without following the reporting procedures or filing a formal complaint might be considered\nevidence of an ill intent on the part of the accuser. Complaints may be written or oral.

Although there is no requirement that you give advance notice, doing so can reduce the impact on\nyour co-workers and productivity. We request a resigning team member submit a written notice of\nresignation at least two weeks in advance. Vacation pay may be withheld without two-weeks’ notice, subject\nto state law. Vacation time may not be included as part of the two-week notice.\n\nBefore a team member leaves, we will schedule an off-site exit interview to better understand the reasons for\nresignation and to go over any resulting benefit changes.\n\n###### Employment Termination\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of\nthe reasons for termination are routine. These are some of the most common circumstances for employment\nterminations:\n\n- FMLA leave expires - failure to perform active work for more than twelve weeks.\n- Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by a team member.\n- Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization.\n- Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for non-disciplinary reasons.\n- Retirement - voluntary employment termination initiated by the team member meeting age, length ofservice, and any other criteria for retirement from the organization.\n\nWe will generally schedule an exit interview at the time of employment termination. The exit interview is an\nopportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of any outstanding\ndebt to Buchheit, or return of Buchheit-owned property. It is also a time for you to voice any suggestions,\ncomplaints, and questions you may have. Since employment with Buchheit is based on mutual consent,\neither you or Buchheit have the right to terminate the employment relationship at will, with or without cause\nor advance notice, at any time.\n\nYour benefits are affected by termination in several ways. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and\npayable at termination will be paid out. Some benefits may be continued at your expense if you choose. You\nwill be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations\nfor continuing them.\n\n###### Termination Date\nIf an employee or independent contractor fails to report to work at the normally scheduled time, or a\ndriver abandons a truck, their termination date is the last day they worked. If an employee is on\nWorker’s Compensation, short-term disability, military leave or Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and\nis released to return to work and fails to report, their termination date is the date they were released to\nreturn to work.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_52_0.png)\n\n###### Re-Hire Policy\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/If you should terminate employment with us and then be re-hired, our policy requires that certain steps may\nhave to be taken before re-employment:\n\n- Re-hires must be approved by management.\n- An updated application may be required, and an updated background check may be requested.\n- Pre-employment drug screen if more than 30-days have lapsed since last day worked.\n- WorkSteps testing if more than 30-days have lapsed since last day worked.\n- Benefits may be reinstated if termination date was less than six weeks prior to your re-employment date.\n- New Hire Orientation class *may* be required.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_53_0.png)\n\n###### Employee Benefits\n\nBuchheit provides a wide range of benefit programs to eligible team members. Certain legally required\nprograms (such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance)\ncover all employees in the manner required by the laws. While some of the benefit programs we offer may\nrequire you to contribute to the cost, many programs are partially or fully paid by Buchheit.\n\nYour eligibility for each benefit program depends on a variety of factors, including your team member\nclassification. To better understand exactly which benefit programs, you are eligible for, talk to\n[your supervisor.

Team members in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation:\n\n- Full-time team members\n- Regular part-time team members\nFull-time team members paid vacation time increases each year, with the length of employment as shown in\nthe following schedule:\n\n- After 1 year, the team member is entitled to 5 vacation days (40-hours) each year.\n- After 2 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 10 vacation days (80-hours) each year.\n- After 10 years of eligible service, the team member is entitled to 15 vacation days (120-hours) each year.\nRegular part-time team members will receive 20 hours of vacation per year after 2 years of service. To be\neligible for vacation as a part-time team member, you must work a minimum of 1,000 hours during the\npreceding two calendar years.\n\nThe length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a \"calendar year\". A \" calendar year\" is defined as\nthe 12-month period that begins when you start earning vacation time. Your benefit year may be extended\nfor any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. (Military leave has no effect on the\nbenefit calculation.) See the leave of absences policies in this Handbook for more information.\n\nOnce you enter an eligible employment classification, you begin to earn paid vacation time according to the\nschedule in this policy. You can use earned vacation time in the year after it is accrued.\n\nYou may use vacation time in minimum increments of one day. To schedule vacation time, you should\nrequest the time off through your Paycom profile to obtain approval from your supervisor. Each request will\nbe reviewed based on a number of factors, including our business needs and staffing requirements.\n\nDifferent departments and jobs within the company require different responsibilities. Therefore, vacations\nare granted on an individual basis depending, in part, on the needs of the business. Other conditions may\napply as stated in 6.01 Leaves of Absence.\n\nVacation time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the vacation. It does not include overtime or any\nspecial forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Drivers\nvacation time is paid based on the average rate of pay for the prior years’ earnings.\n\nWe encourage you to use your available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the\nevent that you do not use your available vacation by the end of the benefit year, you will forfeit the unused\ntime.\n\nIf your employment terminates, you will be paid for any unused vacation time that has been earned through\nyour last day of work, if a two-week notice is given and/or according to state requirements.\n\n---\n\n![(S| BUCHHEIT LOGISTICS MILES BEYOND](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_55_0.png)\n\n**Unpaid Time Off Policy**\nEffective 12/08/All team members are eligible for unpaid time off after one completed year of employment. When unpaid time\noff is requested for personal reasons, a team member’s accrued vacation leave must be fully used before unpaid\ntime off can be requested.\n\nUnpaid time off is granted only in whole-day increments. It may be granted for a single workday or a number\nof consecutive workdays up to a maximum of three (3) days. Unpaid time off cannot be granted for more than\nthree (3) consecutive workdays. Unpaid absences of more than three (3) days must be requested under the leave\nof absence policy. Team members are not paid for this absence.\n\nTeam members maintain their regular benefits while absent from work on approved unpaid time off as long as\nthe benefit payments are made bi-weekly and kept current during the leave. Since contributions to the Buchheit\nRetirement Plan are based on team member earnings, unpaid time off will reduce the team member and\nemployer contributions to the plan.\n\nTeam members must request for unpaid time off through the human resource/time off software at least three (3)\nweeks in advance of the desired time off. The three (3) week advanced request will allow time for the facility to\nproperly complete a schedule to make sure we have adequate coverage for business needs. Requirement may be\nwaived in emergency situations.\n\nFacility Manager and/or Human Resource Coordinator are responsible for obtaining departmental decisions and\ncommunicating either approval or denial back via the human resource/time off software at least two (2) weeks\nprior to the requested unpaid time off. Approval or denial decisions must take into consideration the staffing\nand budgetary needs of the facility and the amount of unpaid time that has already been taken for the calendar\nyear. If request is considered excessive more than 10 days in a calendar year the request maybe denied.\nRequests may be approved or denied on the basis of these or other reasonable considerations.\n\nTeam members who are absent from work without approval of their supervisor may be subject to disciplinary\naction accordance with Attendance and Punctuality Policy.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_56_0.png)\n\n###### Holidays\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 12/16/We provide holiday time off with pay to eligible full-time team members who have completed 180 calendar\ndays of service as a full-time team member. If you are eligible for paid holidays, your holiday pay will be\ncalculated on your straight time pay rate. Holiday hours will be calculated as the following:\n\n- Full time team members working 40 hours a week will receive 8 holiday hours\n- Full time team members working 32 hours a week will receive 6.4 holiday hours\n- Full time team members working 30 hours a week will receive 6 holiday hours\nAlso, to be paid for a holiday, a full-time team member must work both the last scheduled workday\nimmediately preceding the holiday and the first scheduled day immediately following the holiday.\n\nIf a recognized holiday falls during an eligible team member's paid absence (such as bereavement or\nvacation), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have\napplied.\n\nIf eligible non-exempt team members work on a recognized holiday, the team members will receive holiday\npay plus wages at one and one-half times their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday.\n\nA holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday can either be observed on Friday or Monday for office team\nmembers. Check with your manager to schedule your holiday.\n\nPaid time off holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining overtime.\nPayment for these holidays will be observed on the date of the recognized holiday.\n\nRecognized holidays are:\n\n- New Year's Day (January 1)\n- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)\n- Independence Day (July 4)\n- Labor Day (first Monday in September)\n- Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)\n- Christmas (December 25)###### Workers' Compensation Insurance\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Workers’ Compensation provides payment for medical expenses, wage loss, and disability to an\nemployee in the event of an injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires\nmedical, surgical, or hospital treatment. The injury must occur in the course and scope of employment.\nSubject to the applicable legal requirements, this program provides benefits after a short waiting period\nor, in the event of hospitalization.\n\nThe company is concerned about its employees. The Company and the Safety Department will work\nwith all employees injured on the job. Our priorities are to see that you receive proper medical attention\nand return to work as soon as possible.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_57_0.png)\n\nIt is critical that you inform your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless\nof how minor it might appear at the time. Immediate reporting ensures that, if eligible, you will qualify for\nworkers' compensation benefits as quickly as possible and also lets us investigate the matter promptly.\nFailure to report an injury will result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.\n\n**You must report any injury to the Workers’ Compensation Department within 8 hours**\nNo action will be taken to initiate a claim on the employees’ behalf until the Safety Department has been\nnotified.\n\nDrivers are assumed to be 'on the job' when they are physically in the truck and/or performing duties\nrequired of them as a driver, including but not limited to, making check calls, loading/unloading, and\nperforming pre-trip inspections. Drivers are not 'on the job' when they are commuting in a personal\nvehicle to and from work.\n\nWorkers' compensation is intended to cover only work-related injuries and illnesses. Because of this, neither\nBuchheit nor our insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for\ninjuries that might occur during team members' voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or\nathletic activities that we may sponsor.\n\nThe Safety Department **must** be notified before authorization for medical treatment will be given. The\nCompany will designate medical providers for treatment for any work-related injury (except for\nemergency situations). If you decide to go to a doctor other than the one we suggest, you risk paying the\nmedical costs yourself. The Safety Department has access to obtaining qualified doctors anywhere in the\nUnited States.\n\nEach Workers’ Compensation claim will be investigated thoroughly. In the event a claim is deemed\ncompensatory, you will be paid by the company based on the laws of the state in which you were hired.\nYour weekly benefits will be a percentage of your gross average weekly wage. This means the weekly\nbenefits may be significantly less than your net pay. You should also note there is a minimum waiting\nperiod of 3 days (depending on the state Workers’ Compensation laws) before the weekly benefits goes\ninto effect. This translates into a week or two without income. The calculation of your weekly benefit\nand the waiting period is not a policy set by the company but rather by state laws.\n\nYour claim may be administered, and benefits paid to you by a third-party administrator.\n\nThe Company will offer modified duty work to drivers who sustain work injuries if the treating\nphysician feels the driver is capable of modified duty work. Injured drivers will be offered modified\nduty work that will meet their physical capabilities. Modified duty work is intended as rehabilitation and\nshould be temporary only.\n\nIf your claim is investigated and found to be fraudulent, benefits will be denied, and internal disciplinary\nactions will be taken. If deemed appropriate, legal action may also be taken. A preventable on the job\ninjury may disqualify a driver from the Safety Award program.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_58_0.png)\n\nIn the event an injury results in time away from work, drivers will be responsible for making regular\ncontact regarding their status with their supervisor and the Safety Department. It is very critical to the\nhandling of a claim that the driver keeps the Safety Department informed of his/her medical status.\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on Worker’s\nCompensation that would normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or\nbefore the first day of the coverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the\nattention of the Corporate Payroll Department. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage.\n\nWhile the company cannot guarantee it will hold open an employee’s regular job during an extended\nperiod of leave, or while an employee is performing modified duty work, the Company will consider the\nphysicians estimated length of absence from the employee’s regular job in determining whether the\nemployee will be permitted to return to work.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Workers’\nCompensation time off is applied toward FMLA leave allowance, if eligible for FMLA. If not eligible\nfor FMLA, then a request for a Leave of Absence may be considered.\n\n###### Time Off to Vote\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit encourages you to fulfill your civic responsibilities by voting in elections. We expect that you will\nbe able to vote either before or after work hours. However, if you cannot vote during your nonworking hours,\nwe will grant up to three hours of unpaid time off to vote.\n\nIllinois team members will receive two hours of paid time off to vote *if* their scheduled work day starts less\nthan two hours after voting time begins *and* ends less than two hours before voting time ends. The team\nmember will be required to submit a voter's receipt.\n\nIn order to accommodate your absence, you should request the time off from your supervisor at least two\nworking days prior to an election day.\n\n###### Bereavement Leave\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 0 5 / 28 /201 In the event that you need to take time off in the event of the death of a family member, Buchheit\nprovides bereavement leave. To request bereavement leave, see your supervisor for the proper form.\nDocumentation is required to be submitted with the form.

You may also, with supervisory approval, use any\navailable paid leave benefits, such as vacation, for additional time off as necessary.\n\nWe grant up to three days of paid leave for the death of an immediate family member. The bereavement\nleave policy defines \"immediate family\" as your spouse, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, brother,\nsister, step-brother, step-sister, spouse's parent or spouse's step-parent.\n\nWe grant up to one day of paid leave for the death of an extended family member.

Salaried team members are eligible for paid jury duty\nleave. If you remain on jury duty beyond the period of paid jury duty leave, you may use any available paid\ntime off, such as vacation time, or request an unpaid jury duty leave of absence.\n\nIf you receive a jury duty summons, show it to your supervisor as soon as possible so that arrangements can\nbe made to accommodate your possible absence from work. You are expected to report for work whenever\nthe court schedule permits.\n\nBenefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during unpaid jury duty\nleave and will resume when you return to active employment.\n\n###### Witness Duty\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/We provide witness duty time off to team members who receive a subpoena to testify in court.

This time will be without company compensation but will not be in place of earned\nvacation. Consequently, it will not result in loss of vacation time or vacation compensation.\n\nThe employee may use vacation time for military duty. The Company will pay the normal company\ngroup insurance contributions during the leave of absence for military reserve training.\n\n###### Sickness\nAn employee who misses work due to illness may be required to provide a doctor’s note. After an\nemployee has been unable to work 3 consecutive days because of a non-job-related illness or injury, the\nemployee may be required to present a doctor's release and/or a return to work physical to return to duty.\n\n###### Life-Threatening Illnesses in The Workplace\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Team members with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to\ncontinue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. Buchheit supports\nthese endeavors as long as team members are able to meet acceptable performance standards. As in the case\nof other disabilities, we will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal requirements, to\nallow qualified team members with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs.\n\nMedical information on individual team members is treated confidentially. Buchheit will take reasonable\nprecautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure.\n\nSupervisor/managers and other team members have a responsibility to respect and maintain the\nconfidentiality of team member medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is\nsubject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nIf you have a question or concern about life-threatening illnesses, we encourage you to contact the Payroll\nDepartment or our Employee Assistance Program for information and referral to services and resources.\n\n###### Leaves of Absence\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/There may be times when you need to be away from work for urgent personal reasons. At these times, you\nmay be granted unpaid (nonexempt) or paid (exempt) leave depending upon your circumstances. However,\nleaves of absence will not be granted for convenience or personal benefit. These examples include starting an\noutside business, building a home, harvesting crops, extending vacation, etc. After three days, consecutive or\nnon-consecutive requested unpaid days, in a calendar year, the team member is required to use remaining\nvacation time.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_61_0.png)\n\nExceptions to this policy will be handled on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the Chief Financial\nOfficer, Loss Prevention Manager, and Location Management.\n\nThe following are some situations where you might request a leave of absence. Your supervisor must\napprove the request.\n\n- Death of a Family Member. - See Bereavement Policy\n- Family Illness. If a member of your immediate family is ill and being absent from work to attend mattersrelated to the illness is necessary for you, you may be granted a leave of absence. If circumstances warrant\nit, you may take a leave of up to three days. For serious health conditions of a child or a spouse, you may\nrequest a longer leave of absence under the FMLA.\n\n- Jury/Civic Duties.

Payments will be due by each Friday of your pay cycle.\n\n###### Family and Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA)\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 grants qualified employees an unpaid leave of absence for\nup to 12 weeks in a 12-month period at the time of the birth/adoption of a child, or in the case of a\nserious health condition affecting the employee or the employee’s spouse, child or parent.\n\nThe company recognizes that a leave of absence from active employment may be necessary for family or\nmedical reason. This leave of absence policy complies with the provisions of the Family and Medical Act of\n1993 (FMLA).\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_62_0.png)\n\n***Family and Medical Leave Policy***\n\nI. **Purpose:** To outline the conditions under which an employee may request time off without pay for a\nlimited period with job protection and no loss of accumulated service if the employee returns to work.\n\nII. **Definition:** A family or medical leave of absence is defined as an approved absence available to eligible\nemployees for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year under particular circumstances that are critical to\nthe life of a family.\n\nLeave may be taken:\n\n- on the birth of an employee’s child;\n- on the placement of a child for adoption or foster care with an employee;\n- when an employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;or\n\n- when an employee is unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of his or her positionbecause of the employee’s own serious health condition.\n\nA “serious health condition” is one that requires inpatient or residential care or continuing treatment by a\nhealth care provider. “Continuing treatment” includes two or more treatments by a health care provider\nfollowed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider. It also\nincludes treatment of pregnancy or prenatal care, treatment of a chronic health condition of a serious nature,\ntreatment of a long-term or permanent health condition for which the family member must be under\ncontinuing supervision of a health care provider, or any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a\nhealth care provider either for restorative surgery or a condition, which if untreated, would result in an\nincapacity of more than three days.\n\nFor the purpose of this policy, a \"serious health condition\" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or\nphysical or mental condition that involves:\n\n- Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,hospice, or residential medical care facility; or\n\n- A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or any otherregular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health\ncare provider; or\n\n- Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care; or\n- A period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma,diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); or\n\n- Any absences to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by, or onreferral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three\nconsecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).\n\nFor the purpose of this policy, health care providers who may provide certification of a serious health\ncondition include:\n\n- Doctor of Medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the Statein which the doctor practices\n\n- Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists and chiropractors (limited to treatment consisting\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_63_0.png)\n\nof manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by x-ray to exist) authorized\nto practice in the State and performing within the scope of their practice under State law\n\n- Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social workers authorized to practice under State lawand performing within the scope of the practice as defined under State law\n\n- Christian Science practitioners listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts\n- Any health care provider recognized by the team member or the team member's group health plan'sbenefits manager\n\n- A health care provider listed above who practices in a country other than the United States and who isauthorized to practice under the laws of that country\n\nA team member's spouse, children (son or daughter), and parents are immediate family member for purposes\nof FMLA. The term \"parent\" does not include a parent \"in-law\". The terms son or daughter do not include\nindividuals age 18 or over unless they are \"incapable of self-care\" because of a mental or physical disability\nthat limits one or more of the \"major life activities\" as those terms are defined in regulations issued by the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nIII. **Scope:** This policy applies to all family and medical leaves of absence except leaves covered under paid\nemployment benefit plans or polices for any part of the 12 weeks’ leave to which the employees may be\nentitled under this policy. In other words, if an employee is entitled to both FMLA (Family and Medical\nLeave Act) and paid leave under another benefit plan or policy, the employee must take the paid leave\nfirst.\n\nIV. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for leave under this policy, an employee must have been employed here for at\nleast 12 months and must have worked at least 1250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the\nbeginning of the leave. While on leave your time vested is protected, and you will not lose any benefits\naccrued prior to the date the leave began (except any accrued paid leave that you are required to exhaust).\n\n*Exception:* If an employee on leave is salaried and among the highest paid 10% of Company employees\nwithin 75 surface miles and keeping the job open for the employee would result in substantial and serious\neconomic injury to the Company, the employee can be denied job restoration after leave. In this situation,\nhowever, the employee will be given an opportunity to return to work during leave.\n\nV. **Basic Regulations and Conditions of Leave:** Medical certification. The Company will require\nmedical certification to support a claim for leave for an employee’s own serious health condition or to\ncare for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. For the employee’s own medical leave, the certification\nmust include a statement that the employee is unable to perform at least one of the functions of his or her\nposition. For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certification must include an\nestimate of the amount of time that the employee is needed to provide one.\n\nCovered employers must take the following steps to provide information to team members about FMLA:\n\n- Post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining rights and responsibilities under FMLA\n- Include information about team member rights and obligations under FMLA in team member handbooksor other written material, including Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs)\n\n- If handbooks or other written materials do not exist, provide general written guidance about team memberrights and obligation under FMLA whenever a team member requests leave\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_64_0.png)\n\n- Provide a written notice designating the leave as FMLA leave and detailing specific expectations andobligations of a team member who is exercising his/her FMLA entitlements. The team member may use\nthe \"Employer Response to Employee Request for Family or Medical Leave\" to meet this requirement.\nThis employer notice should be provided to the team member within one or two business days after\nreceiving the team members notice of need for leave and include the following:\n\n`o`\nThat the leave will be counted against the team member's annual FMLA leave entitlement\n`o`\nAny requirements for the team member to furnish medical certification and the consequences of\nfailing to do so\n`o`\nThe team member's right to elect to use accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave and whether the\nemployer will require the use of paid leave, and the conditions related to using paid leave\n`o`\nAny requirement of the team member to make co-premium payments for maintaining group\ninsurance and the arrangements for making such payments\n`o`\nAny requirements to present fitness-for-duty certification before being restored to his/her job\n`o`\nRights to job restoration upon return from leave\n`o`\nTeam member's potential liability for reimbursement of health insurance premiums paid by the\nemployer during the leave if the team member fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave\n`o`\nWhether the team member qualifies as a \"key\" team member and the circumstances under which the\nteam member may not be restored to his or her job following leave\n\nEligible team members seeking to use FMLA leave may be required to provide:\n\n- 30-day advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable\n- notice \"as soon as practical\" when the need to take FMLA is not foreseeable (at least verbal notice to theemployer within 1-2 business days of learning of the need to take FMLA leave)\n\n- sufficient information for the employer to understand that the team member needs leave for FMLA-qualifying reasons (the team member need not mention FMLA when requesting leave to meet this\nrequirement, but may only explain why the leave is needed)\n\n- where the employer was not made aware that a team member was absent for FMLA reasons and the teammember wants the leave counted as FMLA leave, timely notice (generally within two business days of\nreturning to work) that leave was taking for FMLA-qualifying reason\n\nIn addition to the information required by the FLSA, a covered employer's records must show the following:\n\n- dates FMLA leave is taken, or hours of leave taken if FMLA leave is in increments of less than a day\n- copies of FMLA notices given to and by team members\n- documents describing team member benefits and leave policies\n- premium payments of team member benefits, and record of any dispute over FMLA leave\nThe records must comply with confidentiality requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The\ncompany may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first\nand second opinions differ, the company may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider,\napproved jointly by the company and the employee and paid for by the company.\n\n*Intermittent or reduced leave.* Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule if it is\nmedically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent. If\nleave is requested on this basis, however, the company may require the employee to transfer temporarily to a\npart-time schedule or an alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_65_0.png)\n\n*Spouses combined leave.* Spouses who are both employed by the company are entitled to a total of weeks’ leave (rather than 12 weeks each) for the birth or placement in adoption or foster care of a child for\nthe care of a sick parent.\n\n*Restoration to employment rights.* After a leave, an employee will be restored to the position he or she held\nwhen the leave began, or to an equivalent position. However, if upon the expiration of the leave the\nemployee is unable to perform the essential function of his or her former position because of a physical or\nmedical condition, the employee has no right to restoration to another position. Except as to employees who\nare taking an intermittent leave, as a condition of being restored to their former position, the company may\nrequire the employee to receive certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee be\nable to resume work.\n\nVI. **Notification and Reporting Requirements:** When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth\nof a child, the placement in adoption or foster care of a child, or planned medical treatment, the\nemployee must provide reasonable prior notice (thirty days) and make an effort to schedule leave so that\nit does not unduly disrupt Company operations. Employees who are ill will be required to report\nperiodically on their status and their intention to return to work.\n\nVII. **Status of Employee Benefits During Leave of Absence:** Health insurance. Group health care\ncoverage will continue for employees on leave as if they were still working.\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to pay for their portion of the insurance premiums while on leave that\nwould normally be handled through payroll deduction. Payments are due on or before the first day of the\ncoverage month. Payments should be made to the company and sent to the Corporate Payroll\nDepartment. Failure to do so may result in the loss of coverage. If the leave is paid, premiums will\ncontinue to be paid through payroll deductions.\n\nThe Corporate Payroll Department will provide a schedule of payment amounts and due dates at the\nbeginning of any unpaid leave of absence. (After 12 weeks of leave the team member is then responsible for\n100% of the premium.)\n\nRecovery of premiums. If an employee chooses to return to work (meaning: stay for 30 calendar days) after\nan approved unpaid leave of absence, the Company may recover from the employee the cost of any payments\nmade to maintain the employee’s health insurance, unless the failure to return is because of a serious health\ncondition or reasons beyond the employee’s control.\n\nBenefit entitlement based on length of service will be calculated as of the last paid workday before the start\nof the unpaid absence.\n\nIf the employee fails to return to work at the conclusion of the leave, the Company may require the employee\nto reimburse the full cost of the health care coverage during any period of unpaid leave.\n\nVIII. **Procedures:** Employees must contact Corporate Payroll to have FMLA paperwork sent to them.\nEmployees must complete the employee portion of the paperwork including signature and date, and have\ntheir physician complete the Physician portion of the paperwork including signature and date.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_66_0.png)\n\n*Request form.* The employee must fill out a “Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence” Form in\nduplicate. This form must be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate\nsupervisor for proper approvals, and forwarded to the Human Resources Department (see attached copy of\n‘Request for Family and Medical Leave of Absence’ form). If possible, the form should be submitted days before the effective date of the leave.\n\nAll requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness must include sufficient medical\ncertification stating:\n\n(1) the date on which the serious health condition began;\n(2) the probable duration of the condition; and\n(3) the appropriate medical facts that the health care provider knows about the condition.\n\nIn addition, for leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the\namount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care.\n\nFor leave for an employee illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform at least\none of the functions of his or her position. For certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave\nschedule for planned medical treatment, the certificate must state the dates on which such treatment is\nexpected to be given and the duration of the treatment.\n\nA team member who expects or anticipates taking a family or medical leave is required to notify the\nCorporate Payroll Department of the date of commencement and the expected duration of the leave at least\n30 days in advance of the leave, or, if the need for the leave is not foreseeable, as soon as practicable. In\ncases where the need for leave is foreseeable, a team member's failure to provide 30 days’ notice prior to\ntaking leave may result in denial or delay of leave. A team member requesting leave under this policy should\nsubmit a complete application for leave form to the Corporate Payroll Department.\n\nCertain \"key employees\" may not be eligible to be restored to the same or an equivalent position at the\nconclusion of their leave. Buchheit will notify such team members of their \"key employee\" status and the\nconditions under which job restoration may be denied, if applicable. \"Key employee\", as defined by law, is\ntypically a management position.\n\nAn eligible team member may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period\nwithout loss of seniority or benefits. The amount of leave available to a team member at any given time will\nbe calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the 12-month period immediately\npreceding the requested leave. A team member who fails to return to work immediately following expiration\nof the authorized leave period will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. All leave taken under this\npolicy and leave for any other reason which would qualify under FMLA (e.g. worker's compensation leave)\nwill be counted against the team members leave entitlement under FMLA.\n\nDuring a family or medical leave provided under this policy, team members shall first exhaust all unused\nvacation before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. During a leave related to the team member's\nserious health condition, the team member should also exhaust any available vacation or short-term\ndisability before continuing such leave on an unpaid basis. Team members will not receive vacation pay in\naddition to compensation from disability or worker's compensation insurance.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_67_0.png)\n\nIf a team member takes a leave of absence because of the serious health condition of the team member or the\nteam member's family member, the team member must submit to the Corporate Payroll Department written\nmedical certification from a health care provider of the serious health condition. Failure to provide such\ncertification upon request may result in a denial or delay of leave. Buchheit reserves the right to require that\nthe team member receive a second (and possibly a third) opinion from another health care provider (at\nBuchheit's expense) certifying the serious health condition of the team member or the team member's family\nmember. Buchheit reserves the right to require that a team member provide the company with a\nrecertification of the medical condition for which leave is taken.\n\nBefore being able to return to work, a team member who is on leave of absence as a result of his or her own\nserious health condition must submit a health care provider's written certification that the team member is\nable to return to work. Failure to provide such certification may result in the delay or denial of job\nrestoration. During the team member's leave, Buchheit may also periodically inquire as to the team member's\nintent to return to work.\n\nLeave taken because of the team member's or family member's serious health condition may be taken on an\nintermittent or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary. If a team member seeks leave on an\nintermittent or reduced schedule basis, the team member must submit medical certification, as discussed\nabove, and additional certification from the health care provider that the intermittent or reduced schedule\nleave is medically necessary.\n\nBuchheit may require a team member taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave to transfer temporarily to\nan alternative available position for which the team member is qualified or may modify the team member's\ncurrent position to better accommodate the team member's recurring periods of leave.\n\nDuring the team member's family or medical leave of absence, team members have the option to stop\ncoverage or stop premium payments during the FMLA leave. If the team member elects to continue\ncoverage, Buchheit will continue to provide health insurance coverage; however, the team member will\nremain personally responsible for paying the team member's portion of the insurance premium. Such\npayments may be paid prior to the leave or paid during the leave. Payments must be submitted directly to the\nCorporate Payroll Department. The team member must make similar payments for all other benefits in full\nduring the period leave. A team member who does not return may be required to repay any insurance\npremiums paid by Buchheit during the leave. Team members will be eligible for COBRA benefits at the end\nof their 12-week FMLA leave of absence or the last day payment was received.\n\nUpon return from family or medical leave in accordance with this policy, the team member will be returned\nto the same or equivalent position with no loss in benefits, which accrued prior to the leave of absence. A\nteam member who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave will be considered to have\nvoluntarily resigned.\n\nIf you anticipate the possibility of taking family or medical leave, or if you have any questions about the\napplication of this policy to your particular situation, contact the Payroll Office or Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAdditional details on The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 may be obtained by contacting the\nCorporate Payroll Department.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_68_0.png)\n\n###### Return to Work Post-Employment Testing\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 01/01/Post-employment examinations are successful tools utilized to create a more safe and secure working\nenvironment for team members.

Eligible team members may participate in the\n401(k)-plan subject to all terms and conditions of the plan.\n\nThe 401(k) savings plan allows you to elect how much salary you want to contribute and direct the\ninvestment of your plan account, so you can tailor your own retirement package to meet your individual\nneeds. Buchheit also contributes an additional matching amount to each team member's 401(k)\ncontribution, equal to one half of the contribution up to 2% of your gross wages, after the 1st year.\n\nBecause your contribution to a 401(k) plan is automatically deducted from your pay before federal and state\ntax withholdings are calculated, you save tax dollars now by having your current taxable amount reduced.\nWhile the amounts deducted generally will be taxed when they are finally distributed, favorable tax rules\ntypically apply to 401(k) distributions. Complete details are described in the Summary Plan Description\nor contact Payroll for more information.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_72_0.png)\n\n###### Employee Assistance Program\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 03/18/We care about team members' health and well-being and recognize that personal problems can sometimes\ndisrupt personal and work lives. While many problems can be solved on your own or with the help of family\nand friends, there may be times when you need professional assistance and advice.\n\nThrough the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Buchheit provides you and your immediate family\nmembers with confidential access to professional counseling services for help in confronting such personal\nproblems as alcohol and other substance abuse, marital or family difficulties, financial or legal troubles, and\nemotional distress.\n\nThe EAP offers problem assessment, short-term counseling, and referrals to appropriate community and\nprivate services.\n\nThe EAP is strictly confidential and designed to safeguard the participant's privacy and rights. The\ninformation you give an EAP counselor can be released only with your written consent, and EAP counselors\nare guided by a Professional Code of Ethics.\n\nPersonal information about EAP participation is maintained in a confidential manner. No information about\nyour participation in the program is made known to Buchheit. EAP counselors are required by law to notify\nthe company if the team member, co-workers, or customers are at risk.\n\nWe offer EAP as a benefit to our team members, and there is no cost to consult with an EAP counselor. If\nfurther counseling is necessary, the EAP counselor will outline available community and private services,\nand the cost of these services will be the responsibility of the team member.\n\nIf you have concerns that are negatively affecting your life, we strongly encourage you to use the Employee\nAssistance Program.\n\n[You can reach a confidential EAP counselor by dialing 1-800-356-0845 or](http://www.paseap.com/)[www.paseap.com](http://www.paseap.com/)[.](http://www.paseap.com/)\n\n###### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/Buchheit offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) program that allows team members to have pre-tax\ndollars deducted from their salaries to pay for eligible out-of-pocket expenses. The pre-tax contributions\nmade to the FSA can be used to pay for predictable non-reimbursed health care expenses during the plan\nyear.\n\nThrough the FSA program, you can reduce your taxable income without reducing your real income, so that\nyou can keep more of the money you earn.\n\n---\n\n![(@ Cs) BUCHHENT MILES BEYOND EXPECTATIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Logistics_Buchheit_Logistics_image_73_0.png)\n\nFull-time team members who have completed 90 days of employment by July 1st are eligible to participate\nin the Flexible Spending Account program.\n\nParticipation in the Health Care FSA is optional and determined on an annual basis for the plan year. You\nmust enroll for each plan year, which begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th. You determine how much to\ncontribute to the account, up to a specified maximum, based on anticipated expenses during the plan year.\nContributions are directed to the FSA through salary reduction on a pre-tax basis. This tax-free money is\nthen available to you for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Since the amounts that remain in the\naccount at the end of the plan year are forfeited, you should take care not to over-fund your account.\n\nDetails of the Flexible Spending Account program are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD).\nContact the Payroll Department for more information on the FSA program and to obtain enrollment and\nreimbursement forms and worksheets with examples of reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses.\n\n###### Team Member Discounts\nEffective Date: 03/23/Revision Date: 09/01/The ***Buchheit*** ***Team Member Discount Program*** was developed as a way to say, \"Thank You\" and\nshow our appreciation to our Team Members for their hard work and dedication.\n\nThe Buchheit team member discount program has been designed to benefit you for all of your hard work and\ndedication as a vital part of the Buchheit team.
