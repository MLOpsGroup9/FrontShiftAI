A brief introduction of these\nbusiness philosophies follows and includes insights about their importance in the LFHI workplace and\nhow they are incorporated into our everyday business environments.\n\n**OUR VISION**\nOur vision for the Company identifies what it is we are striving to achieve and what we ultimately want\nthe Company to be.

They\nset out to answer the question “what is it that we do?” You will notice the icon that’s used to convey our\nCompany’s mission looks like a person and an exclamation point is incorporated into the design. The\nicon signifies the importance of each person in our Company - employees make sensational service\nhappen and employees create what we call the “WOW!” factor. Everyone has a role in this. As you read\nour mission statement, we ask that you think about what it is that you will do to make our mission come\nalive.\n\n**Together**\nOne Company, two brands (store formats), and the connection of all entities: stores, production facilities\nand corporate support office.\n\n**We**\nTeam, community, caring, and responsibility.\n\n**Create**\nInnovation, synergy, opportunity, delivery, service, empowerment, pride, higher standards, market\nleadership, and new traditions.\n\n**Sensational**\nExceed expectations, feeling of “WOW!”, extraordinary, unexpected, and fun.\n\n**Shopping Experiences**\nMore than an errand, point of differentiation, world class journey, style, and one-on-one connections.\n\n**For a Lifetime**\nRelationship, retention, ownership, responsibility, bringing them back, families and generations -\ncustomers and employees, better each time, every time, all the time.\n\n**OUR MISSION**\nTogether we create sensational shopping experiences for a lifetime.\n\n**OUR VALUES**\nOur ability to consistently lead will be guided by our values. We thrive on the power and passion of our\nemployees by enthusiastically encouraging and preparing them to be successful. We judge ourselves by\nour beliefs and intentions, while others judge us by our behaviors and actions.\n\nThe values, which guide our business practices, were identified by the Company’s owner, Tres Lund, and\nits executive team members. These values represent a set of beliefs and principles that govern the\nmanner in which we work together and the ways in which we conduct our business.\n\nRespect, honesty and integrity, empowerment, innovation, safety, development and communication are\nCompany values that we bring to life by supporting them and practicing them.\n\n**Teamwork** means collaboration in and with all levels is the key to our success.\n\n*“Together Everyone Achieves More.”*\n\n![Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_5_4](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_5_4.png)\n\n| | OUR MISSION |\n|--|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| | Together we create sensational shopping experiences for a lifetime. |\n\n---\n\n**Respect** means honoring all the diversity in our work environment and includes coworkers, customers,\nvendors, and our communities. It means consideration of others’ feelings, concerns and ideas.\n\n*“People with humility don’t think less of themselves, they just think about themselves less.”*\n\n*“Sometimes when the numbers look right the decision is still wrong.”*\n\n**Innovation** means continually striving to improve our processes, our products, and our quality, and\nhelping our coworkers do their job better.\n\n*“Managing only for profit is like trying to play tennis with your eye on the scoreboard and not on*\n*the ball.”*\n\n**OUR HISTORY**\nBoth Lunds and Byerlys have a rich history, beginning as Minnesota companies founded by local families.\nLunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove’s, a local supermarket back\nin 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store\non Lake Street in Minneapolis.\n\nDon Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden\nValley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single\nCompany in 1997.\n\nThe new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is\nowned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr.\n\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued\nprosperity for the 21st century and beyond.\n\n**MEDIA PHILOSOPHY**\nIt is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or\nother public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we\nspeak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a\nCompany-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your\nlocation manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding\nthe media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office.\n\n###### III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES\n\n**EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER**\nOur Company recognizes and values the benefits of diversity in people, ideas and cultures. Accordingly,\nour Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment\nfree from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a\npolicy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender,\nage, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with\nregard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law.\n\n---\n\nThis commitment applies to all policies and procedures relating to all phases of employment including\nselection, training, promotions, demotions, transfers, discipline, compensation, benefits, layoff, recall,\nand termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all\nclassifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment.\n\nIf you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or\nprocess that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your\ndepartment manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources.\n\nYou can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal\nemployment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your\ncomplaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be\nengaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up\nto and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion.\n\n**REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES**\nOur Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting\ndiscrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any\nqualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such\nindividual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential\nfunctions of the job.\n\nConsistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a\nqualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us\naware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her\nposition. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue\nhardship for the Company.\n\nYour medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file.\nThe Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate\ndisclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the\nconfidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information\nis subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at\nmanagement’s discretion.\n\nEmployees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the\nessential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This\npolicy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions\nnecessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws.\n\n**IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE**\nOur Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are\nauthorized to work in the United States. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of\n1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility\nVerification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility.\nFormer employees who are rehired with the Company must recertify their employment eligibility by\n\n---\n\ncompleting a new I-9 and provide the appropriate documentation to establish identity and employment\neligibility. Questions about immigration law issues may be directed to the human resource department.\n\n**RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE**\nAs part of our strong stand and value set with respect to our EEO, discrimination and harassment\npolicies, all of us have an obligation and duty to be proactive, intervening and addressing any acts that\nmay be potentially offensive or inappropriate particularly from a race and/or religious basis. This\nincludes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or\nclasses of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might\nbe displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by\nreporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It\nalso includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory\nand reporting such to your manager to take action to correct the situation.\n\nThe key message is: Be proactive and address issues by reporting them to your manager as you see\nthem occur.\n\nWe all are responsible for providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and\nintolerant acts, while maintaining the highest levels of respect, teamwork and innovation.\n\n**RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**\nFor those employees who can provide proof of strongly held religious beliefs, the Company will\nreasonably accommodate religious-based requests with respect to work schedule, breaks, position\nassignment, or other work-related activities provided such requests do not impose an undue hardship\non the work and/or operational needs of the business.\n\nYou are responsible for informing your manager of the need for such religious-based accommodations in\nwriting.\n\nFor more information and/or concerns, please see your manager or contact a human resources\nrepresentative.\n\n**HARASSMENT INCLUDING OFFENSIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR**\nAll employees have a right to expect and enjoy respectful work environments. Employees are prohibited\nfrom harassing other employees whether or not the incidents of harassment occur on employer\npremises and whether or not the incidents occur during working hours. The Company has a zero\ntolerance harassment policy and any harassment or offensive or inappropriate behavior may result in\ncorrective action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nThe Company prohibits all sexual and other forms of harassment. Harassment consists of unwelcome\nconduct, whether verbal, written or physical, that is sexual in nature and/or based upon a person’s\nprotected status, such as race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status,\nmedical condition, veteran status, sexual orientation or other protected status under applicable law.\n\n---\n\n**SEXUAL HARASSMENT**\nSexual harassment includes any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or visual, verbal\nor physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment; or\n Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the\nindividual; or\n Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work\nperformance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment\n\nForbidden conduct: With respect to harassment, the following is a partial list of conduct that violates the\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. Non-Harassment & Retaliation policy:\n Unwelcome sexual advances\n Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors\n Threatening retaliation or retaliating after a negative response to sexual advances\n Leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying sexually suggestive or offensive objects, photographs,\ncartoons, calendars or posters\n Transmitting inappropriate, sexual, or offensive images, derogatory posters, cartoons, drawings or\ninformation through social media, a computer network, electronic mail, or any other means of\ncommunication\n Using obscene, derogatory, or vulgar language, epithets, slurs, sexually explicit or otherwise\ninappropriate jokes, or making inappropriate or derogatory comments about an employee\n Written communications of a sexual nature or containing statements which may be offensive to\nindividuals in a particular protected group such as racial or ethnic stereotypes or caricatures that are\ndistributed in hard copy, on social media, via a computer network, or any other means of\ncommunication\n Unwelcome verbal sexual advances or propositions\n Verbal abuse of a sexual nature such as unwelcome graphic or verbal commentary about an\nindividual’s body, sexually degrading words to describe an individual, suggestive or obscene letters,\nnotes or invitations\n Unwelcome physical conduct such as touching, assault, impeding or blocking normal movements\n Retaliation against or toward an individual for making harassment reports to the company or for\nparticipating in an investigation into harassment allegations\n\nRetaliation or reprisal against persons making complaints or providing information will not be tolerated.\nThe company strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee for using this complaint procedure,\nreporting harassment, or for filing, testifying, or participating in any manner in any investigation, or\nhearing conducted by the company or governmental enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation\nincludes, but is not limited to, termination, demotion, suspension, failure to hire or consider for hire,\nfailure to give equal consideration in making employment decisions, failure to make employment\nrecommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions or otherwise denying any\nemployment benefit. Any employee found to have retaliated against another employee will be subject\nto disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nReporting an Incident: If you experience behavior that is offensive or uncomfortable, or are aware of\nharassment in the workplace, please advise the person who is initiating such behavior that you find it\noffensive and ask him or her to stop. If you are uncomfortable confronting the individual directly, or if\n\n---\n\nthe behavior persists, you must advise your supervisor or your location manager and a human resources\nbusiness partner of your concerns.\n\nAll complaints will receive immediate attention, including an investigation and any corrective action\ndeemed necessary by the Company to ensure that the harassment and/or offensive behavior stops. All\ncomplaints of this nature will be kept confidential with information being disclosed to only those\npersons who have a legitimate need to know.\n\nAll managers must notify the human resources department of any harassment complaints that they\nreceive. All management, together with the human resources department, are responsible for ensuring\nthat appropriate and timely action is taken to investigate harassment complaints and respond with\nactions that effectively resolve the situation and prevent recurrence of the behavior.\n\nFalse and malicious complains of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as opposed to complaints\nthat, even if erroneous, are made in good faith) may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.\n\n**EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL**\nAll employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an\nemployment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment\nrelationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you\nas the employee or the Company as your employer at any time, for any reason, with or without cause,\nand with or without notice. No manager or any representative of the Company, other than an officer of\nthe Company, has the authority to enter into any agreement with you for employment for any specified\nperiod, or to make any promises or commitments that are contrary to the employment-at-will policy.\nAny such agreements entered into by an officer of the Company must be in writing and signed by the\nofficer.\n\n**EMPLOYEE REFERRALS**\nWe often find that our own employees are our best source of potential employees and as such we\nappreciate and encourage employee referrals. Our employee referral program provides you with the\nopportunity to earn a bonus (less applicable taxes) for every employee that you refer that becomes\nemployed by the Company. Check with your location manager for specific information regarding the\nreferral program.\n\n**EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND ROOMMATES**\nFamily members, significant others, and roommates are a good source of referrals and future\nemployees. All are welcome to apply for and accept employment with the Company. However, to\nreduce the intrusion of domestic relations in our work environment, we ask that immediate family\nmembers, significant others and roommates avoid working in the same department whenever possible,\nand we prohibit family members, significant others and roommates from working in positions where\none is the direct supervisor or manager of the other. When such cases occur, the Company will attempt\naccommodation through transfer, relocation, or job change. In such situations, the affected employees\nwill need to decide which remedy they will select. An exception is made for periods of less than twentynine (29) calendar days where relatives may work together to satisfy short-term, temporary needs of\nthe business.\n\n---\n\n**ETHICSPOINT**\nEthicsPoint is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool for employees to report fraud, abuse and\nother misconduct in the workplace in a completely confidential and anonymous manner. You can file an\nEthicsPoint report from any computer that can access the Internet at the following website:\nwww.lundfoodholdings.ethics-point.com . You can file online from home and many public locations,\nincluding public libraries. If you don’t have access or are uncomfortable using a computer, call the\nEthicsPoint toll-free hotline - 1-866-437¬4478. It’s available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nNothing in our policies, guidelines or handbook is meant to restrict any activity that is protected under\nthe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\n\n###### IV. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n**STANDARDS OF CONDUCT**\nIt is important that employees understand that their conduct is a reflection on our Company. We expect\nthat all employees conduct themselves in alignment with our Company values and demonstrate\nintegrity and trust at all times. The following represents an overview of what we call standards of\nconduct, and are examples of conduct that will interfere with the productivity of our operations and the\nsafety and security of our employees. Although the Company firmly supports the concept of progressive\ndiscipline, conduct of this type may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment at the discretion of management. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or represent all\npossible examples of unacceptable behavior; rather it is intended to provide examples of the types of\nbehavior that could jeopardize the employment relationship. For more information, contact your\nmanager or a human resources business partner.\n\n**Rudeness to a customer**\nAs a Company, we base all of our decisions on what is best for the customer. We are absolutely\ncommitted to providing sensational service, treating every customer with respect and dignity, and in a\nconsiderate and friendly manner. If you find yourself in a challenging customer situation that you believe\nyou are unprepared to handle, it is your responsibility to contact a manager for assistance. Failure to\ntreat any customer with respect and dignity and in a considerate manner is inexcusable and will not be\ntolerated.\n\n**Not reporting for or completing a scheduled shift**\nWhen you miss a scheduled shift, arrive late, or leave early, our customer service is in jeopardy. You are\nexpected to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. To minimize the disruption\ncaused by an unplanned absence, it is absolutely essential that you contact your manager as far in\nadvance of your shift as possible.\n\nFailure to notify a manager of an absence or secure approval to leave early in advance of your shift is\ninexcusable and will not be tolerated and may result in an unexcused absence and disciplinary action.\n\nIf you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive working days without proper notification to your\nsupervisor/manager, you will be considered as having abandoned your job and resigned employment.\nJob abandonment will also occur when you fail to return to work or directly notify your supervisor or\nmanager of the reason for absence within two (2) consecutive working days after any approved leave of\nabsence or disciplinary suspension.\n\n---\n\nFor more information, please review the attendance policy and/or speak with your manager.\n\n**Misappropriation of money or propertytheft**\nTaking money, products, supplies or other forms of Company, customer, or employee property is\nforbidden. Additionally, a receipt must accompany all product purchases, and no product can be\nconsumed without paying for it first. When consuming a product in a retail store, the receipt must be\nvisible to show proof of purchase. Failure to adhere to these procedures can cost you your job, and\nprosecution by local law enforcement officials is possible.\n\nFailure to provide an accurate account of time actually worked that results in payment for time not\nworked is considered theft and could cost you your job.\n\n**Working off the clock**\nWe value the work that you do and it’s important to us that we compensate you for all work that you\nperform in your position. Therefore, we have provided you with multiple tools that you may use to\naccurately report all time spent performing any and all work. We expect that you will use these tools\naccurately and consistently. Performing work without reporting the time as time worked will not be\ntolerated and could cost you your job.\n\n**Alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants**\nYou may not possess, be under the influence of, or use any alcohol or illegal drugs, including\ninappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications or other intoxicants while on the\njob. This behavior represents a safety hazard and will not be tolerated. In no case is any employee\nallowed to report to work or return to work while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs,\nincluding inappropriate use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications, or other intoxicants.\n\nWe encourage any employee with an alcohol or drug dependency problem to voluntarily enter a drug or\nalcohol rehabilitation program before the problem affects or jeopardizes their employment. Employees\nwho violate this policy are subject to discipline despite participation in a program or a request for\nassistance. Further, to help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, employees may be asked\nto submit to drug testing to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and/or unauthorized use of\nalcohol. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including\ntermination of employment. Any such test will be at the Company’s expense and by a physician and/or\ntesting facility selected by the Company and in full compliance with state and federal law.\n\nIf you are under a physician’s guidance and are taking prescription drugs or other medication which may\naffect your ability to work safely, you should not perform your job duties if doing so will pose a threat to\nyour own safety or the safety of others. You must review this with your manager.\n\n**Fighting, threatening or violent behavior**\nLund Food Holdings, Inc. prohibits all forms of violence including, but not limited to, any verbal or\nphysical threats or threatening behavior or other behavior intended to cause or causing apprehension\non the part of another employee or customer. Fighting or other acts of threatening or violent behavior\nthat is threatening to yourself or others or results in injury to yourself or others or damage to property\nwill not be tolerated. If a disagreement arises, or you witness, receive, or have been told that another\nperson has witnessed or received such acts of behavior, you are responsible for contacting a manager\nimmediately to resolve the situation. Do not engage in argumentative behavior or violent behavior. This\n\n---\n\npolicy is strictly enforced. Violations may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment and criminal prosecution of those involved.\n\n**Firearms and weapons**\nPossession of firearms or weapons while at work or on Company property is strictly prohibited and will\nserve as grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Further, if any\nindividual violates this policy and refuses to comply, it will result in immediate notification of the proper\nlaw enforcement authorities. This prohibition applies to all employees, vendors, temporary workers and\ncontractors, including those who have a valid permit to carry a handgun pursuant to the Conceal and\nCarry law. The only exception authorized by management would be hired security.\n\nThe Company also reserves the right to search and inspect property, including purchases and lockers,\nand persons on Company property, and while operating Company machinery, equipment or vehicles for\nwork-related business, and while conducting Company business off premises.\n\n**Intentional misuse, damage, or destruction of property**\nWe recognize that from time-to-time something may drop or break unintentionally, and we would ask\nthat you take the time to use all Company property and equipment with care. Negligence or\nintentionally destructive acts that result in damage to Company property, or other employees’ or\ncustomers’ possessions, equipment, or property will not be tolerated.\n\n**Return of Company property**\nYou are responsible for all property, materials, equipment or written information issued to you or in\nyour possession or control. All Company property must be returned by employees on or before their last\nday of work. When permitted by applicable law, the Company may withhold from your paycheck or final\npaycheck the cost of any items that are not returned when required. In addition, the Company may take\nlegal action deemed appropriate to recover and/or protect its property.\n\n**Falsification of employment records, time records, or other Company records and transactions**\nYour honesty and integrity are essential and required.

When you do stretches, you ultimately\ndecrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static\nstretching - which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-seconds - is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as “warm-ups”\nto those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:\n\n Head/Neck Roll - Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling.\nLook over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times.\n Shoulder Shrugs - Raise shoulders up toward ears and hold. Make full circles-up, forward,\ndown and backward. Repeat 3-5 times.\n Elbow Press for Middle Back - Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly\nbackward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times.\n Back Extension - Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for\nsupport. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times.\n Leg Stretches - While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the\nsame with your left leg. Repeat 3-5 times.\n Wrist Circles - Slowly rotate hands up, down and around in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.\n Ankle Circles - One at a time, rotate ankles in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.\n\nCaution: If any of these stretches cause acute discomfort, do not do them.\n\n**Keeping Your Back Injury-Free** **-** Many jobs require routine lifting. To protect yourself and others from\ninjury, always use proper body mechanics when lifting, carrying or moving items. Use these safe lifting\ntechniques:\n Stretch\n Lift safely\n Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like ***Shoes For Crews®***\n- ask your manager about them.\n Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs.\n Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting.\n Know your limits - don’t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for\nhelp; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips.\n\nRegular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise\nprogram, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises.\n\n**Did You Know?**\n\n The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting. Take care to follow safe\nlifting techniques.\n\n![Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_40_7](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Retail_Lunds___Byerlys_image_40_7.png)\n\n| | Did You Know? | |\n|--|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n| |  The most common injury is a back injury due to improper lifting.
