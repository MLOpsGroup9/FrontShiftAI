Hamer, Sr. created B & G Food Enterprises, LLC when they received a\nfranchise from Taco Bell to operate a restaurant in Morgan City, Louisiana. Today, B&G operates Taco\nBells in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. We are the largest Taco Bell Franchisee in Louisiana and\nmaintain our Corporate Headquarters in Morgan City, Louisiana.\n\nIn 1997, Brenda and Greg received a Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchise in Louisiana. Also, in 1998, B &\nG’s first Taco Bell-KFC “2n1” Restaurant opened in Morgan City, Louisiana.\n\nOur Restaurant Support Center and Corporate Office is located at 1430 Sandra Street in Morgan City,\nLouisiana.\n\nWe are very proud to be a part of Yum! Brands Inc., the parent company of Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried\nChicken, and Pizza Hut. We hope you will share that same sense of pride as an employee of B & G Food\nEnterprises, LLC. It is a pleasure to have you join our family.\n\n- Brenda and Gregory Hamer, Sr.\n\n![Manufacturing_B_G_Foods_image_5_11](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Manufacturing_B_G_Foods_image_5_11.png)\n\n---\n\n#### TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT\n\nThis employee handbook has been prepared as a general guide to inform you about the human resources\npolicies and procedures of B & G Food Enterprises, LLC.

The minor to be employed must obtain the required employment certificate\n(Minor Work Permit) from the school board, and the Store Manager is to have a copy of the employment\ncertificate in the files of the Morgan City office with the electronic hiring packet.

In locations where a health\npermit or health certification is required, you must provide such documents to your manager on your first\nday of employment. These documents will be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager.

Background investigations may include review of criminal conviction records. Conviction of\na crime is not an absolute bar to employment and will not automatically eliminate an individual from\nconsideration for or continuation of employment. All relevant circumstances, such as how long ago the\nconviction occurred and the crime involved, will be considered in relation to specific job requirements.\nConviction of a crime that is related to the job the individual is expected to perform may be cause for denial\nof employment. Arrest records alone will generally not be considered in determining an individual’s\neligibility for employment, although the underlying behavior may be considered.\n\nThe company will comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all applicable\namendments when conducting any type of background investigation (e.g., criminal, credit, motor vehicle\nrecord, etc.). Particularly, the Human Resources Representative will ensure the correct disclosure of rights\nhas been made, authorization has been received before a background investigation is conducted, appropriate\nadverse action notices have been provided in instances in which an adverse action is taken due to the results\nof a background investigation, and the safeguarding of personally identifiable financial information has\nbeen maintained.

Reasonable measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive\nconsumer-related information.\n\nThe company reserves the right not to employ or retain in employment anyone who has been convicted of\nany felony or misdemeanor offense that relates to the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nYou must report any conviction occurring during the course of your employment to the Human Resources\nRepresentative immediately.\n\n**HIRING YOUR RELATIVES**\n\nApproval for hiring relatives must be received from the President of the Company. Relatives may be\nallowed to work in the same restaurant; however, relatives may not work in direct reporting relationships\nor supervise each other in any way. Relatives may not work on the same shift.

All\nemployees share in the responsibility for creating this environment and are expected to demonstrate mutual\nrespect and acceptance in the workplace. We believe that utilizing our employees' uniqueness enhances\ncommunication, problem-solving and decision-making skills, thereby improving our company’s\nproductivity and performance. We also believe that if our employees mirror the diverse make-up of our\ncommunities and our customers, we will be able to better understand, and more effectively respond to,\nmarket changes. We strive for excellence in our ability to create an inclusive, respectful, and equitable\nenvironment for our employees through leadership, policies, and practices.\n\n---\n\n**RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION**\n\nThe company will consider all requests for religious accommodations. Such requests may include time off\nfor attendance at religious services, an absence for observance of a religious holiday, or an employee’s\nattire.\n\nReasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s religious beliefs, unless such an\naccommodation results in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition.\n\n**DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION**\n\nThe company will consider all requests for disability accommodations to individuals who are otherwise\nqualified to perform the essential functions of a job. When an employee has a need for an accommodation,\nthe employee must let the Human Resources Manager know that an adjustment or a change at work is\nneeded for a reason related to a medical condition. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first\nstep in an informal, interactive process between the employee and the company. The company will make\nan attempt to accommodate the employee’s need for workplace changes with the company’s need to\nmaintain an efficient, productive workplace.\n\nBefore addressing the merits of the accommodation request, the company will determine if the employee’s\nmedical condition meets the definition of a disability, a prerequisite for the employee to be entitled to a\nreasonable accommodation. The term disability means, with respect to an individual:\n\n- A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of theindividual\n\n- A record of such an impairment; or\n- Being regarded as having such an impairment\nMajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,\nhearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,\nconcentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of a\nmajor bodily function, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth,\ndigestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive\nfunctions.\n\nThe company may require documentation showing that the employee has a covered disability and stating\nany functional limitations. The documentation must be sufficient to substantiate that the employee has a\ncovered disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested.\n\nReasonable accommodations will be made for an employee’s disability, unless such an accommodation\nresults in an undue hardship for the company or creates an unsafe working condition. An undue hardship\nwill be based upon an individualized assessment of current circumstances.\n\n---\n\n#### TRAINING\n\n**THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS**\n\nAt each of our restaurants, you will hear repeatedly: Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance,\nProduct Quality and Speed with Service. These are the principles that our brands were built on and are the\nstandards for our daily operation. If we can provide our guests with great service, we can keep their loyalty\nand they will come back.\n\nWe want to provide our guests with an atmosphere that is fun, casual, and comfortable. Each of our\nrestaurants has been designed with the guest in mind, in order to make our guests’ stay a truly enjoyable\none. Great service begins and ends with you----we want to have Customer Maniacs working for B&G.\n\n**Cleanliness:** To ensure that our guests have a dining experience that is both pleasant and healthy, we\nconstantly clean and maintain the entire restaurant - the exterior, the dining area, the counter area, the\nrestrooms, and the kitchen. We really never have a “spare” moment, because whenever business slows\ndown, we are cleaning.\n\n**Hospitality:** We treat our customers as if they were guests in our own home. We will go that extra step to\nmake guests feel welcome. We strive to provide good service because it makes our job more pleasant and\nalso improves our business. Taco Bell along with the other YUM Brands spend millions of dollars each\nyear on advertising, but the attentiveness, courtesy, and friendliness you display toward our guests is our\nmost important form of marketing.\n\n**Product Quality and Accuracy:** Our menu items are the product of a great deal of research and\ndevelopment, but we rely on you to make sure that every one of our guests enjoys a hot, tasty, and perfectly\nprepared meal every time they visit one of our restaurants. We are famous for the quality of our food, so\nwe will insist that you follow specific food preparation procedures that are both efficient and sanitary.\n\n**Speed with Service:** One thing always to keep in mind is that efficient guest service is our number one\npriority. Everything we do is for our guest because our guests are our business. Guests come to Taco Bell\nexpecting fast and friendly service, so we expect you to be efficient, attentive, courteous, and respectful at\nall times.\n\n---\n\n#### TEAMWORK\n\nTeamwork plays a big role within each individual restaurant operation. Also, the spirit of teamwork makes\nthe job a great deal more enjoyable, which in turn is passed along to our guests.\n\nThink of teamwork as you would playing a game. One great star does not necessarily do everything it takes\nto help the team win. It is only when all of the players pull together and enjoys the team’s performance\nagain and again. We accomplish a great team performance through proper training.\n\n**THE TRAINING PROGRAM**\n\nThe Company training program is implemented in the stores to ensure that employees build the skills\nneeded to serve our customers.\n\n- Doing more for and giving more to customers than the competition.\n\n- Learning the processes and procedures required to meet/exceed expectations and standards.\n\n- Improving performance to ensure the Restaurant’s continuous growth and success.\n\n- Developing employees’ self-sufficiency in running the Restaurant.\n\n**Training Systems:** Web-based training systems are designed for trainees who are new to their jobs. The\ntraining systems help trainees develop the skills and knowledge they need to meet and maintain our high\nrestaurant operating standards. Trainees must be certified in each position that they train for. Your manager\nwill explain all aspects of the Company’s training programs.\n\nIndividuals are constantly encouraged to improve their performance, expand the scope of their\nresponsibilities, and provide training to other employees who need it. That is the only way that restaurant\nemployees can become self-sufficient and successful.\n\nYour managers will explain all aspects of the Company’s training program.\n\n---\n\n#### COMPENSATION\n\n**OUR PAY PROCEDURES**\n\nThe payroll period is two work weeks (14 days) long. It begins on Wednesday at 12:00 a.m. and ends two\nweeks later on Tuesday 11:59 p.m. Payday is on Friday of the week following the end of the payroll period\n(every other Friday).

When this occurs, we expect you to cooperate and help out wherever and whenever you\nare needed. Overtime occurs when hours worked exceed 40 hours in a workweek (Wednesday - Tuesday).\n\n---\n\nOvertime is authorized and scheduled only by the General Manager and is never scheduled at crew member\ndiscretion. You must receive advance approval from the General Manager prior to working overtime.\n\nVacation, sick leave, and other paid absences are not considered time worked for the purpose of calculating\novertime pay. You must actually work over 40 hours in a workweek in which a paid absence day occurs\nto receive overtime pay.\n\n**EARNING A PAY INCREASE**\n\nThe Company uses a merit pay increase system. The Company may award pay increases to you subject to\nyour individual performance and the profitability of the Company. Pay increases are at management’s\ndiscretion and are neither automatic nor guaranteed. You will be considered for a merit pay increase based\non outstanding job performance and company growth.

The Human Resources\nRepresentative may seek clarification from your health care provider regarding the information contained\non the certification form with your written authorization provided to the company and to your health care\nprovider. The Company reserves the right to request a second and/or third opinion, at the Company’s\nexpense, from a health care provider chosen by the Company. Additionally, a recertification verifying the\nneed for leave may be requested by the Company to support a continuing medical leave every 30 days or\nat the expiration of the minimum duration of the condition, whichever is later. Such recertification can be\nrequested at any reasonable interval but not less than every 30 days unless:\n\n◼\nYou request an extension of leave;\n\n◼\nCircumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly; or\n\n◼\nCompany management receives information that casts doubt on the continuing validity of the most\nrecent certification.\n\nIn the event that appropriate certification or recertification is not provided, the leave of absence will not be\ngranted or continued, and you will be subject to the company’s policies regarding unexcused absences.\n\nFitness-for-duty certification will be required in order to verify that you are able to return to work.\nCertification of fitness to return to duty for absences taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule leave\n\n---\n\nmay be required once every 30 days if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee’s ability to\nperform his or her duties.

No\nrecertification requirements will apply to military caregiver leaves.\n\n**Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave** - Leave taken because of the serious health condition of either\nyou or a covered family member may be taken on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis if such an\narrangement is certified by the health care provider to be medically necessary or to provide care or\npsychological comfort to a covered relation with a serious health condition, as certified by the health care\nprovider. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may also be taken for a qualifying exigency or for military\ncaregiver leave of absence. An employee who needs an intermittent or reduced work schedule leave must\nattempt to schedule leave so as not to disrupt the Company’s operations. Leave taken due to the birth of a\nchild or placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care must be taken in one consecutive period\nunless approved in advance by the Human Resources Representative. Decisions regarding requests for\nintermittent or reduced work schedule leaves in birth, adoption or foster care situations will be based on the\nbusiness need of the Company.

Additionally, the designation\nnotice will include applicable information regarding amount of leave entitlement, paid/unpaid time off,\nfitness-for-duty certification requirements, certification deficiencies, etc. If a FMLA-qualifying reason is\ndetermined by the Company to exist, the Human Resources Representative may designate leave as FMLA\nwhether the employee specifically requests FMLA designation or not. Employees cannot request that the\nCompany waive an FMLA leave designation if the leave qualifies as a bona-fide FMLA leave.\n\n**Notification During the Leave** - You must contact the Restaurant Support Center at least weekly in order\nfor the Company to remain aware of your progress and anticipated longevity of the leave of absence.

You are\nexpected to return to work immediately following the health care provider’s release.\n\n**Reinstatement** - This leave provides that you will be able to return to your former position or an equivalent\nposition, with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, if you\nreturn to work within the 12-week period (or 26-week period for military caregiver leave), or at the\nconclusion of the need for the leave.\n\nThere are limited circumstances in which you may not be reinstated from leave (e.g., in the event\nof a reduction-in-force.) You have no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and\nconditions of employment than if you had not been on FMLA leave.\n\nAdditionally, employees who are considered “key employees” under the provisions of the Act may\nbe denied reinstatement if the reinstatement would result in substantial and grievous economic\ninjury to company operations and if the employee was provided the appropriate notice, stating\nsuch, at the commencement of his/her leave. A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible\nemployee who is among the highest paid 10% of the company’s entire workforce within 75 miles\nof the employee’s worksite.\n\nIf you do not return to work within the 12-week (or 26-week) period or when the reason for the leave ends,\nwhichever occurs first, your position may be terminated, and you must then follow the normal job\napplication procedures required of external candidates in order to reapply for the position.\n\n**Employment Benefits** - Taking a leave may not result in the loss of any employment benefit available\nbefore the date that the leave started.\n\n**Paid Time Off** - No sick leave or vacation days are earned during the unpaid leave period.\n\n**Insurance Continuation** - During the leave, you will be permitted to retain your current medical insurance\ncoverage as specified in the provisions of the Company’s policy, subject to you paying your portion of the\ncost of the insurance coverage.

Likewise, if\nan employee fraudulently obtains leave or accepts other employment while on leave without the prior\nwritten approval of the Human Resources Manager, the employee will not be entitled to benefits under this\npolicy and employment may be terminated.\n\nIn the event of a divorce, legal separation, a child losing dependent status under the plan(s), or the\nbirth or placement of a child with you for adoption, you must inform the Human Resources\n\n---\n\nRepresentative within 60 days of the occurrence of the qualifying event. Failure to provide written\nnotification of such a qualifying event within the 60-day period will result in loss of the right to\ncontinuation coverage.\n\n**OUR GROUP INSURANCE PLAN**\n\nThe Company offers Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance for eligible managers and employees. The\ncompany may pay a portion of the cost of these benefits. Specific information about coverage and cost is\navailable through the Human Resources Department.\n\nOptional life insurance is available for spouses and children of covered employees, and you must pay the\ncost for this dependent life insurance coverage.\n\nAn information booklet and I.D. card will be provided to you upon enrollment in the insurance coverage;\nplease contact the Human Resources Department for more information.\n\n**CONTINUING INSURANCE COVERAGE (COBRA)**\n\nThe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provides that you and covered family\nmembers may be eligible to temporarily extend your medical insurance coverage at group rates in certain\ninstances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end.

For additional information regarding COBRA or\nto provide notification of a qualifying event for COBRA coverage, contact the Restaurant Support Center.\n\n**ON-THE-JOB INJURIES - WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE**\n\nWorkers’ compensation insurance is maintained by the company to provide compensation to employees for\nloss of wages due to injury or illness that occurs in or as a result of employment and also pays necessary\nrelated medical expenses, according to applicable state law.\n\nIn the State of Texas, you may elect to decline such coverage if, no later than five days after beginning\nemployment, you notify the Human Resources Representative in writing that you wish to retain your\ncommon law right of action. In such an instance, you would not be covered by the insurance plan and\nwould not be able to obtain workers’ compensation income or medical benefits in the event of a job-related\ninjury or accident. If you decline workers’ compensation insurance coverage, your employment may be\nterminated immediately, as coverage under workers’ compensation insurance is a condition of employment\nwith the company.\n\n**All job-related injuries and accidents, regardless of the need for medical attention or severity of the**\n**injury or illness, must be reported immediately to the Manager-In-Charge. Failure to do so may**\n**result in non-payment of medical services. The Manager-In-Charge is responsible for reporting any**\n**work-related accident, illness, or injury immediately to the GM. Failure to comply with B&G**\n**accident reporting procedures can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of**\n**employment.**\n\nThe Company will require an alcohol or drug test if you are involved in a work-related accident.\n\nIt is expected that all employees are truthful in the reporting of work-related injuries. Workers’\ncompensation fraud occurs when someone willfully makes a false statement or conceals information in\norder to receive workers’ compensation benefits or prevents someone from receiving benefits to which they\n\n---\n\nmight be entitled. This organization will not tolerate fraud. If you think workers’ compensation fraud is\noccurring, notify the Manager, VP, Senior Staff, Human Resources Department, or the Owner at (985) 3843333 so that an investigation may occur.\n\nThe Company will follow the provisions of its *Family and Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA)* policy when\nadministering leave due to on-the-job injuries. If you are eligible for such leave and are unable to perform\nthe duties and responsibilities of your position, you may receive up to 12 weeks of leave as described in the\nFMLA policy. If you are injured on-the-job and are unable to perform your regular duties and\nresponsibilities as a result of an on-the-job injury, and you do not qualify under the policy, the Company\nreserves the right to replace you after you have missed seven consecutive days of work.

You must speak directly to the Manager-in-Charge unless prior arrangements have been made\n\n---\n\nwith the manager for other acceptable ways to communicate that you will be absent or tardy (i.e., text\nmessage, speaking with another designated person, leaving a voice mail message, etc.). In the event you\nmust leave work unexpectedly, you are to notify your manager or appropriate designee as soon as the need\narises.\n\nAbsences or tardiness occurring more than twice in the same week may be grounds for termination.\n\n**WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD**\n\nStores will usually be open even during severe weather. If the restaurant is open, you are expected to show\nup for scheduled shifts. Failure to come to work results in no pay for scheduled shifts.\n\nThe Area Coach will determine whether a Restaurant will open in the event of severe weather.

Other people or companies should not unfairly benefit from the\ncompany’s competitive confidential information. The need to protect the company’s competitive\nconfidential information should not be misinterpreted as chilling the right of employees to communicate\nabout their wages, hours and working conditions.\n\nThe need to protect the company’s competitive confidential information also should not be misinterpreted\nas inhibiting the company’s use of its own information. However, caution and discretion are required in\nthe use of such information and in sharing it only when required in the normal course of business. While\nthe company’s normal operations require the full flow of information throughout the organization,\nconfidential information available to one department or division of the company should be communicated\nto other departments or divisions only when required in the normal course of business.\n\nConfidential information obtained as a result of employment with the company is not to be used as a means\nof obtaining personal gain or for the private use of others. Researching information from company records\nabout customers for non-business-related reasons is prohibited. Use or disclosure of such knowledge or\ninformation in an inappropriate manner can result in civil and/or criminal penalties, both for the employee\nand for the company.\n\nOnly authorized company representatives are to communicate with the public on behalf of the company.\nEvents may occur that will draw immediate attention from the news media. It is imperative that authorized\ncompany representatives communicate on behalf of the company to deliver an appropriate message and to\navoid giving misinformation in any media inquiry. All media inquiries regarding company affairs must be\nreferred to the Owner. This policy is intended to control the company’s official message and not to restrict\nemployee communications about wages, hours, and working conditions.\n\n---\n\n**SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEE PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION**\n\nIt is the Company’s intent to safeguard employee personal and private information. Examples of personal\ninformation include social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, emergency\ncontact information, medical information or any other personal or private information to which the public\ndoes not have general access, or which may directly identify an individual. In the course of performing\ntheir job duties, some employees may have access to gain the personal and private information of other\nemployees (i.e., setting up payroll, medical benefits, etc.). These employees are expected to only use such\ninformation in the course of performing their job. It is expected that all employees maintain confidentiality\nof the personal or private information of other employees. Employee personal or private information may\nonly be released for business-related reasons on a need-to-know basis with approval from the Human\nResources Representative, or as required by applicable law.\n\n**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\n\nYou should recognize your responsibility to avoid any conflict between your personal interest and those of\nthe Company’s business interests. A conflict of interest exists when you, knowingly or unknowingly,\nengage in any activity that may compromise you, another employee, or the company in its relationship with\na customer, vendor, or competitor. Also, a conflict of interest occurs when the Company’s interests\ninterfere, or appear to interfere, with your ability to make sound business decisions on behalf of the\nCompany. Nothing in this policy is to be interpreted as applying to concerted activity for mutual aid and\nprotection under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nYou are prohibited from engaging in any activity, practice, or act which conflicts with, or appears to conflict\nwith, the interests of the Company, its customers, or vendors. Full disclosure should be made to the\nManager-in-Charge of any potential conflict of interest, before it occurs, is required.\n\nYou should not have additional employment in a competitive restaurant or other business which could\ninterfere with your ability to work or to provide your best performance for the Company, and such\nemployment must never result in a conflict of interest. You should inform you Manager-in-Charge if you\ndecide to obtain employment in addition to your job with the Company.\n\nAdditionally, personal relationships which may result in a conflict of interest are discouraged and, as such,\nemployees must comply with the following policies:\n\n- **Employees are not permitted to fraternize socially with fellow employees, if such personal**\n**relationships would result in conflicts of any type.**\n\n- **It is not permitted for a Manager to fraternize out-side of the workplace with an employee under**\n**his or her authority.**\n\n- **It is not permitted for any Manager to give a ride to an employee under his or her authority.**\n\n**EMPLOYEE DATING**\n\nDating between employees is discouraged by company management. If such relationships occur and create\nany type of disruption in the workplace, the company reserves the right to transfer or terminate one or both\nemployees involved.\n\nManagers and supervisory personnel are prohibited from dating or engaging in intimate personal\nrelationships with employees reporting to them either directly or indirectly.\n\n---\n\n**GRATUITIES**\n\nYou cannot receive gifts in any form from customers, supplies, or servicing organizations.

However, depending upon the\nnature and severity of the problem, the Company may enact any disciplinary measure (verbal or written\nnotice, probation, or termination) at any time, without progressing through each stage of the normal\nprocedures. The following disciplinary actions will generally be used in handling unacceptable\nperformance or behavior.\n\n- **Verbal Warning** - The Manager-in-Charge may discuss unacceptable performance or behavior\nwith you. The discussion will indicate the nature of the problem and the action necessary to correct\nit.\n\n- **Written Warning** - When a problem continues despite a verbal warning, the Manager-in-Charge\nmay prepare a written warning to be discussed with you.\n\n- **Probation Period** - A probation period (normally 30 days) may be incorporated in either the first\nor a subsequent written warning. You should realize that probation is the final step prior to\ntermination should improvement in performance or conduct fail to be achieved within the\nprobationary period.\n\n- **Termination** - If prior disciplinary action fails to resolve the problem, the General Manager will\ndocument a recommendation for termination of employment. You will then be notified of the\n\n---\n\ntermination by the General Manager. Certain actions may result in immediate termination of\nemployment, without prior disciplinary action.\n\n**WHEN SUSPENSION BECOMES NECESSARY**\n\nA suspension without pay may be justified when circumstances reasonably require an investigation of a\nserious incident in which you have allegedly been involved. Suspension without pay may be imposed for\nsuch proven misconduct as intentional violation of work or safety rules.\n\n**IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM**\n\nWe are committed to treating all employees fairly and honestly. Our success depends upon the results of\nindividual and team efforts, and each employee’s satisfaction with his or her job. You are encouraged to\ntalk to the General Manager or the Manager-in-Charge if a problem arises in the work environment.\n\nIf the problem is not resolved by the General Manager or Manager-in-Charge, you may ask for a meeting\nwith the Area Coach and/or Director of Operations and General Manager or Manager-in-Charge in an effort\nto work things out. If the problem is still unresolved, you may ask to meet with the President.\n\n---\n\n#### SAFETY\n\n**SECURITY**\n\nThe security of the Company is every employee’s responsibility. The Company takes a very positive\napproach when security matters arise. You should discuss with the Manager-in-Charge and/or the Director\nof Operations any problem which may arise with regard to security.\n\nThe back door of every restaurant should always have its alarm on and be locked. The back door should\nnever be opened after dark. **Under no circumstances is anyone not working allowed in the restaurant**\n**before or after business hours. This includes off-duty crew, family, and friends.

In all cases, a B & G Incident Reporting Form must be filled out and sent to the\nRestaurant Support Center immediately following the incident for immediate processing with the\nappropriate agency or company. Do not hesitate to call for emergency assistance when necessary or when\nrequested by a non-employee involved in an accident. Any video, witness statements or any other valuable\ninformation should be gathered and placed in a safe and secure place. It should then be given to the AC or\nsent to the Restaurant Support Center.\n\n**EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**\n\nIn cases of emergency such as power failure, fire, storm damage or robbery, the Manager-in-Charge will\ninstruct employees and others present in the restaurant as to the appropriate course of action (see Employee\nSafety Program).

The effective date of terminations will be the\nlast day in which you were actively at work. If you abandon your job, you will be paid only for each day\nactually worked. No earned vacation or sick leave will be paid. The exception regarding vacation pay is\nfor employees in Louisiana who, in accordance with Louisiana state law, will be paid earned, unused\nvacation time at separation.
