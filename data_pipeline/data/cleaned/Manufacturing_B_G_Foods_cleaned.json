Background investigations may include review of criminal conviction records. Conviction of\na crime is not an absolute bar to employment and will not automatically eliminate an individual from\nconsideration for or continuation of employment. All relevant circumstances, such as how long ago the\nconviction occurred and the crime involved, will be considered in relation to specific job requirements.\nConviction of a crime that is related to the job the individual is expected to perform may be cause for denial\nof employment. Arrest records alone will generally not be considered in determining an individual’s\neligibility for employment, although the underlying behavior may be considered.\n\nThe company will comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all applicable\namendments when conducting any type of background investigation (e.g., criminal, credit, motor vehicle\nrecord, etc.).

Also, the company will comply with laws governing the proper disposal of any\ndocuments (paper, electronic, or other format) that contain consumer information derived from a credit\nreport. Reasonable measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive\nconsumer-related information.\n\nThe company reserves the right not to employ or retain in employment anyone who has been convicted of\nany felony or misdemeanor offense that relates to the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nYou must report any conviction occurring during the course of your employment to the Human Resources\nRepresentative immediately.\n\nHIRING YOUR RELATIVES\nApproval for hiring relatives must be received from the President of the Company. Relatives may be\nallowed to work in the same restaurant; however, relatives may not work in direct reporting relationships\nor supervise each other in any way. Relatives may not work on the same shift. For the purpose of this\npolicy “relatives” include an employee’s spouse, children, parents, brothers/sisters, grandparents,\ngrandchildren, aunts/uncles, cousins, and corresponding step and/or in-law relations.\n\nDIVERSITY\nOur company is committed to acknowledging and valuing employee differences and to creating an\nenvironment in which every individual's unique strengths and abilities are developed and valued. All\nemployees share in the responsibility for creating this environment and are expected to demonstrate mutual\nrespect and acceptance in the workplace. We believe that utilizing our employees' uniqueness enhances\ncommunication, problem-solving and decision-making skills, thereby improving our company’s\nproductivity and performance. We also believe that if our employees mirror the diverse make-up of our\ncommunities and our customers, we will be able to better understand, and more effectively respond to,\nmarket changes.

Background investigations may include review of criminal conviction records. Conviction of\na crime is not an absolute bar to employment and will not automatically eliminate an individual from\nconsideration for or continuation of employment. All relevant circumstances, such as how long ago the\nconviction occurred and the crime involved, will be considered in relation to specific job requirements.\nConviction of a crime that is related to the job the individual is expected to perform may be cause for denial\nof employment. Arrest records alone will generally not be considered in determining an individual’s\neligibility for employment, although the underlying behavior may be considered.\n\nThe company will comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all applicable\namendments when conducting any type of background investigation (e.g., criminal, credit, motor vehicle\nrecord, etc.).

Also, the company will comply with laws governing the proper disposal of any\ndocuments (paper, electronic, or other format) that contain consumer information derived from a credit\nreport. Reasonable measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive\nconsumer-related information.\n\nThe company reserves the right not to employ or retain in employment anyone who has been convicted of\nany felony or misdemeanor offense that relates to the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nYou must report any conviction occurring during the course of your employment to the Human Resources\nRepresentative immediately.\n\nHIRING YOUR RELATIVES\n\nApproval for hiring relatives must be received from the President of the Company. Relatives may be\nallowed to work in the same restaurant; however, relatives may not work in direct reporting relationships\nor supervise each other in any way.

As employees under the | |\n| age of 18 comprise a major percentage of our restaurant teams, the Louisiana Minor Break Policy for | |\n| employees less than 18 years old will be strictly enforced. | |\n| | |\n| The Company’s policy is above and beyond Louisiana State Law to assure that our minor employees are | |\n| given the appropriate amount of rest as required by law. | |\n| | |\n| Louisiana State Law requires an uninterrupted 30-minute break after no more than 5 hours. | |\n| | |\n| We cannot accomplish the goal of our Minor Break Policy without each minor employee taking | |\n| responsibility to take his or her breaks according to the policy.

Repeated offences may lead to disciplinary action up | |\n| to and including termination. | |\n| - When it comes to our attention that Louisiana State Minor Policy is broken, the minor will be | |\n| terminated immediately.

After a written warning, the Area Coach risks being removed for\n repeated violation.\n\n Minors represent a vital part of our operations. Without them it would be next to impossible to run our\n stores, but if we cannot manage this very important “Human Resource” we will be forced to abandon using\n workers under the age of 18 because the financial constraints (fines up to $500 per infraction) will leave us\n no alternative.\n\nTAKING A BREAK\nYou are expected to take your breaks in the restaurant lobby only.

The Company takes a very positive\napproach when security matters arise. You should discuss with the Manager-in-Charge and/or the Director\nof Operations any problem which may arise with regard to security.\n\nThe back door of every restaurant should always have its alarm on and be locked. The back door should\nnever be opened after dark. Under no circumstances is anyone not working allowed in the restaurant\nbefore or after business hours. This includes off-duty crew, family, and friends. Violation of this\nimportant safety procedure will needlessly endanger the lives of your co-workers and may result in\nyour immediate termination.\n\nSecurity policies and devices should not be discussed with anyone outside the Company. You are\nresponsible for understanding and following the Company’s established security procedures. A violation\nof the safety policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nOnce the lobby is closed at night, never open the door for anyone, including the owner or any of B &\nG’s Staff, unless they have made prior arrangements. Most robberies occur when employees allow someone\nin after the lobby is locked.\n\nSAFETY IS IMPORTANT\nIt is the Company’s policy to provide a safe and healthful workplace. Company safety procedures must be\nfollowed at all times to ensure that crew members and guests enjoy safe restaurant conditions. It is your\nresponsibility to read and understand the safety policies located in each restaurant. The policies cover\ninformation on restaurant equipment, knives, electrical, material handling, storage, employee\nhealth/sanitation, building exterior, severe wind, fires, robbery, and vehicles and driving.\n\nThe safety policies apply to all employees.

You are\nrequired to participate in the safety effort of the Company by working safely and attending and participating\nin safety sessions when offered. Safety sessions are held every quarter. Incidents involving personnel are\nreviewed on a regular basis to identify any possible safety hazards. If you should have an incident or injury,\nreport it to your Manager-in-Charge immediately no matter how insignificant it may seem. If you seek\nmedical attention for a work-related injury, a drug screen is required during the first visit. B&G has\nrecommended medical facilities and are posted in each location.
