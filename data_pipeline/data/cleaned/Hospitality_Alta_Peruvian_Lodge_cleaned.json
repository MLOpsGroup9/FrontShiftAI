All\ninvolved parties may be brought together to resolve the situation.\n\nNote: Your problem may be such that you prefer to discuss it directly with your General\nManager. Always feel free to do so. All employee suggestions and complaints shall be given full\nconsideration. There will be no discrimination or recrimination against any employee because\nhe/she presents a complaint or problem.\n\nIn extraordinary situations, you may prefer to contact the president of Alta Hotel Group directly.\nA “Speak Out” form is available in this manual for this purpose.\n\nGENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES\n\nEmployee Conduct\nEmployees are expected to treat our guests, customers, and one another with respect and\nunderstanding.\n\nAny rudeness (e.g., profanity, yelling, use of vulgar or obscene language, suggestive or sarcastic\ngestures) will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination. Do not talk about company issues in public areas and by no means discuss any\ngrievances with guests.\n\nDating/Marriage Policy\n\nDating or marriage to a coworker in today's business, legal and social environment has an impact\nbeyond the otherwise simple relationship between two people. Among the various factors\ncomplicating matters, the following three \"risks\" are readily apparent.\n\nRisk to the business, reflected in three main areas:\n\n1. Financial defalcation\n2. Inappropriate influence over decision making Judgment\n\n---\n\n## Page 24\n\n3. Compromising operational policies/procedures\n 4. Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism.\n 5. Risk of sexual harassment suits.\n\nAs a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the\nworkplace in the form of a company-wide policy.\n\nIt is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to\nprotect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the\nintent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject,\nthereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management.\nThis policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital):\n\n 1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person:\n a. A department head or any other member of that department.\n b. General Manager and any other hotel employee.\n c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department.\n 2. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the\n connection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential\n conflict of interest by compromising any of the following:\n a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures.\n b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions.\n c. Financial defalcation.\n d. Alteration of hotel documentation.\n\nIt will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to\ncommunicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject\nthat responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral\nreassignment of either party.\n\nOnce communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for\nthe purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to\nprudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior\" positions.\nThere is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In\nthat event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel.\n\nGuest Privacy\nEmployees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on\npremise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out. An\nemployee is in a position to observe the personal actions of many people. It is mandatory that\nyou never discuss your observations either within or outside the property. However, should you\nnotice anything detrimental to the property or its guests, notify your department head, the\nGeneral Manager immediately.\n\nKeep in mind that all guest services (pool, fitness center, lobby, van, etc.) are for guest use only,\nunless otherwise allowed by the GM\n\n3.
