Jacob.pdf,Jacob,11,"Employee Handbook 4 INTRODUCTION Welcome! On behalf of your colleagues, I welcome you to Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning and wish you every success here. We believe that each employee contributes directly to JH&A's growth and success, and we hope you will take pride in being a member of our team. This handbook was developed to describe some of the expectations of our employees and to outline the policies, programs, and benefits available to eligible employees. Employees should familiarize themselves with the contents of the Employee Handbook upon hire and start, for it will answer many questions about your employment with JH&A. We hope that your experience here will be challenging, enjoyable, and rewarding. Sincerely, Robert Jacob President JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 5 100. ORGANIZATION - DESCRIPTION I. Goods and Services Provided Our company has two divisions: Jacob Sheet Metal Works and Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,12,"Jacob Sheet Metal Works fabricates in light gauge sheet metal. We offer galvanized, black iron (cold rolled) metal, aluminum, stainless steel and copper. Our 10' power shear can handle up to 16-gauge galvanized metal (the lower the number, the thicker the material). We do not do any welding, including of aluminum. We solder galvanized, stainless steel and copper. Our sales include everything from small over -the-counter orders, to work performed for various industrial and commercial firms in our area. It is the policy of the company that over -the-counter sheet metal orders will be taken on a first come, first serviced basis. Discretion will be used to prioritize orders that offer more revenue and benefit to the company (ex: a $2000 job vs. a $10 order). The company will make every attempt to advise customers of an appropriate timeframe that it will take to fulfill an order. It is important to note that sheet metal ductwork used by our air conditioning division is fabricated"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,13,"in our shop and these jobs will take precedence to other sheet metal jobs due the primary nature of the business. Most typical duct fittings, such as elbows, boots, and collars are purchased through wholesale distributors. We generally use sheet metal trunk lines, wrapped in duct wrap insulation, followed by flex supply runs. It is the philosophy of the company that this provides the customer with a superior duct system, and JH&A is the only company in the area that offers this. We will use fiberglass duct board for plenums and trunk lines as the specific job is bid. Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning conducts business in HVAC repair, maintenance, equipment sales and installation. Our sales are primarily residential and light commercial. In recent years we have begun to take on more commercial jobs, such as the Main Str eet Bank in DeLand. Our primary installation and repair work is for single family residences. We do not currently perform any refrigeration or chiller work."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,14,"any refrigeration or chiller work. We occasionally do new home construction; this would typically be a custom home situation, as we are not in the business of new home construction. We install and repair gas furnaces and oil -fired furnaces. We do not work on carburetor -type oil furnaces. We install and repair water-to-air heat pumps. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 6 We generally do not work on window ale units. However, we reserve the right to service a customer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two people to remove the customer who has both central and window units. In such a case, we will send two people to remove the window or wall unit and bring it to our shop for bench repairs. The customer must be advised the repairs could be costly, and it may be beneficial to buy a new unit. II. Facilities and Location(s): Our offices and sheet metal shop are located at 611 E. International Speedway Blvd., DeLand FL"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,15,"32724. This street is also known as East Highway 92. Our business is located within the DeLand city limits. Our main phone number is: (386) 734-0901 The back line is: (386) 734-9096. This number should be used for calls outside of regular business hours. Our fax line is: (386) 734-0808 III. History of Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning: Jacob Sheet Metal Works was founded in 1921 by Rudolph Jacob, Robert Jacob's grandfather. He moved to DeLand from Ohio and began working with a wooden brake installing metal roofs, copper work, guttering, and later warm air heating ducts. In those days, metal was shipped down the St. John's River and received at the Lake Beresford settlement. After World War II Robert's father, Paul Jacob joined Rudolph in the family business. Paul’s brother, Ervin Jacob, also worked with the company until 1977. The business was incorporated in 1964. Jacob Sheet Metal Works continued as a thriving business in DeLand during the 50’s, 60's and"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,16,"70’s. The company started concentrating on central heating & air conditioning installations as their popularity grew. Throughout the years, the company has gained a reputation in West Volusia County as the top- quality repair and installation company. We have many customers who have been doing business with Jacob Sheet Metal 30 -60 years, and we respect these people tremendously. Jacob Sheet Metal Works is one of DeLand's oldest businesses. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 7 Robert Jacob grew up in the family business. He obtained college degrees from Daytona Beach Community College and Florida Atlantic University and joined the firm in 1974 after servicing in the U.S. Army. Robert’s wife, Kim Jacob spent her career as an elementary school teacher. Robert and Kim have two children, Jennifer and Clinton. Robert is an active member and deacon in the First Presbyterian Church of DeLand."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,17,"in the First Presbyterian Church of DeLand. Robert's father, Paul, retired, but continued to lead an active life, working around the sheet metal shop nearly every day, until he passed away at the age of 88. In 1998 our heating & air conditioning business evolved to becoming 85% of the company's total sales. Even then, many people in town did not realize that the company did A/C work due to the name, “Jacob Sheet Metal Works.” For that reason, Robert decided i t was time to clarify the position in the marketplace by creating a branch called ""Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning."" This change resulted in major growth in our company, as we now have one of the most recognized names in West Volusia County. Other internal changes have occurred in recent years, including becoming more efficient. In 2000 we changed our repair pricing to ""Flat-Rate Pricing."" This is a proven feature in our industry, which has brought higher profits and stability, and allowed us to pay higher wages to our employees."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,18,"We have also increased employee training and have developed a wide range of employee benefits. Most important, the company is extremely proud to say it has several employees who have been with the company over 10 years, and two have been with us 20 years and over. We are constantly striving to increase our place in the market. Through better managem ent, organization and teamwork, we become more profitable. IV. Organizational Structure: Our company is a corporation registered in the State of Florida. Our company is an official Qualified Business Organization in the State of Florida. Holding a State Class A Contractors License (CAC024345) and L.P. gas license. Fully insured with business liability and workers comp insurance. Memberships: V.A.C.C.A. (county) and A.C.C.A. (national). JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 8 V. Role of the Human Resources Department: Due to the size of the company, the role of Human Resources is fulfilled through a team effort by"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,19,"the President, the office employees, a supervisor, and you, as the employee. VI. Management Philosophy: It is the philosophy of our company that we work as a team, with true success coming only through the combined efforts of each and every employee. Our management philosophy is to expect quality work from our employees, who will receive respect, competitive wages, and above average benefits in return. We believe in an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. Every employee is expected to contribute his best effort, each day, to produce quality service to our customers. We believe this will assure a winning combination, for the company, its employees, and also for the customer. We believe in an open -door policy and strive to create an atmosphere where employees are encouraged to discuss their problems openly with their superiors, without fear of reprisal, and share their accomplishments with others. Every effort will be made to a ssure each employee is"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,20,"always respected and treated equitably. VII. Goals: Our goal is to provide the highest quality service to our customers, at a fair price. In doing so we will provide a profitable business in which our employees can grow while creating a loyal client base within the West Volusia area. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 9 101. Nature of Employment This handbook is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of our personnel policies. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents of this handbook, for it will answer many common questions concerning employment with JH&A. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment and should not be considered all-inclusive. It is not an employment contract and is not intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. Neither the employee nor JH&A is"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,21,"bound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship at any time. In order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, JH&A reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies and/or benefits described in this handbook, except for its policy of employment -at-will. The only recognized deviations from the stated policies are those authorized and signed by the chief executive officer of JH&A. 102. Employee Relations JH&A believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are competitive with those offered by other employers in this area and in this industry. If employees have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are stron gly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors,"" the"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,22,"work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that JH&A amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding effectively to employee concerns. 103. Equal Employment Opportunity In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at JH&A will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. JH&A does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, veteran status, national origin, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. . This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 10 Any employee with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace is"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,23,"encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of retaliation Anyone f ound to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 104. Business Ethics and Conduct The successful business operation and reputation of JH&A is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable l aws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity. The continued success of JH&A is dependent upon our customers' trust and we are dedicated to preserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to JH&A, its customers, and shareholders to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,24,"JH&A will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers, and employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide you with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter should be discussed openly with your immediate supervisor. If necessary, the matter should be escalated to Management for advice and consultation. Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every JH&A employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment. 105. Hiring of Relatives"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,25,"105. Hiring of Relatives The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships. All hiring of family will be considered in a case-by-case basis in consideration of organizational impact. · JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 11 In cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or terminated from employment. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. 106. Employee Medical Examinations"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,26,"marriage. 106. Employee Medical Examinations To help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely, medical examinations may be required. After an offer has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical questionnaire will be required, and a medical examination may be required at JH&A's expense by a health professional of JH&A's choice. The offer of employment and as signment to duties is contingent upon completion of the questionnaire. Any employee off work more than three continuous workdays for an unforeseen illness or injury may be required to present JH&A with a written status report from a qualified healthcare provider. The status report must contain a diagnosis of the illness or injury, an acceptable explanation of why the employee cannot perform his or her job duties, and a reasonable expected return-to-work date. (Also see employee policies under Section 601 ""Medical Leave"")."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,27,"Information on an employee's medical condition or history will be kept separate from other employee information and maintained confidentially. Access to this information will be limited to those who have a legitimate need to know. 107. Immigration Law Compliance JH&A is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form 1 -9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed a 1-9 with JH&A within the past three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 12"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,28,JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 12 Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged to contact the Controller. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal. 108. Conflicts of Interest Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which JH&A wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to p rovide general direction so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of operation. Contact Management for more information or questions about conflicts of interest. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of JH&A's
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,29,"business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. No ""presumption of guilt"" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of JH&A as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which JH&A does business, but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving JH&A. 109. Outside Employment"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,30,"109. Outside Employment Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they are open and honest about their outside employment with their direct supervisor and meet the performance standards of their job with JH&A. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to JH&A's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the outside role precedes employment with JH&A, the employee should make the intention to maintain their outside position during the application/interview process with JH&A. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 13 If JH&A determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of JH&A as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with JH&A. ""Moonlighting,"" or outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,31,"Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside JH&A for materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs. Due to various reasons, the following will be considered as unacceptable conflicts of interests: - Working for a competitor as a direct employee or as a subcontractor - Taking business away from JH&A by serving an existing customer - Any business that uses JH&A time or material. It is important to note that service performed by an individual employee outside of JH&A business hours could be interpreted as JH&A related work from a legal perspective, and that it is against the law for a homeowner to hire an unlicensed individual to perform work. JH&A is in no way responsible for business performed by an individual outside of assigned jobs/duties. 110. Non-Disclosures The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,32,"the success of JH&A. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples: - wages or personal employee data - computer programs and codes · - customer lists - customer preference - financial information - marketing strategies - pricing for pending projects and proposals Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business s information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 14 111. Disability Accommodations JH&A is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. All employment practices and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Hiring procedures have been reviewed and provide persons with disabilities meaningful"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,33,"employment opportunities. Pre -employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's ability to perform the duties of the position. Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, where their disability affects the performance of job functions. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the situation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation) as well as in job assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists. Leave of all types will be available to all employees on an equal basis. JH&A is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified employees or applicants because they are related to or associated with a person with a disability. JH&A will follow any"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,34,"state or local law that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA. This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. JH&A is committed to taking all other actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. 112. Employment Categories It is the intent of JH&A to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the employment relationship at will at any time is retained by both the employee and JH&A. Each employee is designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,35,"provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT employees are excluded from specific provi sions of federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee's EXEMPT or NONEXEMPT classification may be changed only upon written notification by JH&A management. In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong lo one other employment category: JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 15 REGULAR FULL-TIME employees are those who are not in a temporary or introductory status and who are regularly scheduled to work JH&A's full -time schedule. Generally, they are eligible for JH&A's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limita tions of each benefit program. PART-TIME employees are those who are not assigned to a temporary or introductory status and who are regularly scheduled to work less than 32 hours per week. While they do receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensa tion insurance), they are"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,36,"ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. INTRODUCTORY employees are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position or with JH&A is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the introductory period will be notified of their new em ployment classification. TEMPORARY employees are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any in itially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insu rance and Social Security), they are ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,37,"ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. CASUAL employees are tho.se who have established an employment relationship with JH&A but who are assigned to work on an intermittent and/or unpredictable basis. While they receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are ineligible for all of JH&A's other benefit programs. 113. Access to Personnel Files JH&A maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information as the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance appraisals and salary increases, and other employment records. Personnel files are the property of JH&A, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of JH&A who have a legitimate reason to review information in a file are allowed to do so. Employees who wish to review their own file should contact their manager. With reasonable"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,38,"advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in JH&A's offices and in the presence of an individual appointed by JH&A to maintain the files. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 16 114. Employment Reference Checks To ensure that individuals who join JH&A are well qualified and have a strong potential to be productive and successful, it is the policy of JH&A to check the references of all applicants. All applicants will be asked, in writing, to authorize background checks for felony convictions, driver’s license reports, workers comp reports, and a nation-wide search on sex offender violations. The information obtained from the screening will be considered on a case by case basis and each situation will be considered individually. Management will respond in writing only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in writing. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,39,"position(s) held. 115. Personnel Data Changes It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify JH&A of any changes in personnel data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplish ments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personnel data has changed, notify the Office Manager. 116. Introductory Period The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. JH&A uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. Either the employee or JH&A may end the employment relationship at will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,40,"All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the length of the absence. If JH&A determines that the designated introductory period does not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may be extended for a specified period. Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the ""regular"" employment classification. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 17 During the introductory period, new employees are eligible for those benefits that are required by law, such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security. After becoming regular employees, they may also be eligible for other JH&A provided benefits, subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Employees should read the information for each specific"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,41,"benefits program for the details on eligibility requirements. Your employment with JH&A is a voluntary one and is subject to termination by you or JH&A at will, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modi fy in any way the employment -at-will status of JH&A employees. This policy of employment -at-will may not be modified by any officer or employee and shall not be modified in any publication or document. The only exception to this policy is a written employment agreement approved at the discretion of the President or th e Board of Directors, whichever is applicable. 117. Employment Applications JH&A relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may"

Performance Evaluation Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. Performance evaluations are scheduled approximately every 12 months, generally occurring in the late spring. Merit-based pay adjustments are awarded by JH&A in an effort to recognize truly superior employee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous factors, including the information documented by this formal performance evaluation process.

A number of the programs (such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your supervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs can be found elsewhere in the employee handbook. The following benefit programs are available to eligible employees: - COBRA Major Medical Benefit Conversion at Termination - Drug or Alcohol Rehabilitation Program (at employee's own expense) - Employee Assistance Program (through the Drug Free Workplace) - Family Leave (as required by Law) - Holidays - Major Medical Insurance for Employee - Dependent Major Medical Insurance through payroll deduction"

The benefit package for regular full -time employees represents an additional cost to JH&A of approximately 32 percent of wages. Due to government regulations, there may be a waiting period required for certain benefits. For a current and comprehensive list of benefits guidelines and plans, see the Office Manager."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,45,*Spiff benefits will only be extended/paid to Full-Time/Active employees. 120. Holidays - JH&A will grant holiday time off to all employees on the holidays listed below: - New Year's Day (January 1) - Memorial Day (last Monday in May) - Independence Day (July 4) - Labor Day (first Monday in September) - Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November) - Christmas (December 25) JH&A will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees immediately upon assignment to an eligible employment classification. Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee's straight-time pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day. Eligible employee classification(s): - Regular full-time employees A recognized holiday that falls on a Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday. A recognized holiday that falls on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday.
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,46,"If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's paid absence (such as vacation or sick leave), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have applied. If eligible nonexempt employees work on a recognized holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus wages at their straight -time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. Due to business needs, there will be on-call requirements for Service Technicians and those who are deemed as “on-call” JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 20 will inevitably work holidays. The holiday on -call schedule will be determined in advance and requests for PTO will be accommodated the best of JH&A’s ability, but are not guaranteed. Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining whether overtime pay is owed. 121. Workers' Compensation Insurance JH&A provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,47,"employees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable leg al requirements, workers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee is hospitalized, immediately. Employees who sustain work related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. No matter how minor an on -the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. Depending on the requirements of the Worker’s Compensation insurance provider, and the situation, a drug and/or alcohol test may be required of the employee to submit a claim. Neither JH&A nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off -duty"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,48,"recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by JH&A. 122. Time Off to Vote JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, JH&A will grant up to 1 hour of paid time off to vote. Employees should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two working days prior to the election day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at the beginning or end of the work shift, whichever provides the least disruption to the normal work schedule. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 21 123. Jury Duty JH&A encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required. JH&A will pay an employee for up to 5 days of jury duty, with proof of summons. After 5"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,49,"days, employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired, employees may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits). Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Employees are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either JH&A or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in JH&A's judgment, the employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. JH&A will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave. 124. Witness Duty JH&A encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by JH&A,"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,50,"they will receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. Employees will be granted unpaid time off to appear in court as a witness when requested by a party other than JH&A. Employees are free to use any available paid leave benefit (such as vacation leave) to receive compensation for the period of this absence. The subpoena should be shown to the employee's supervisor immediately after it is received so that operating requirements can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee's absence. The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. 125. Benefits Continuation (COBRA) The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under JH&A's health plan when a ""qualifying event"" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 22"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,51,"JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 22 qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a reduction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at JH&A's group rates plus an administration fee. JH&A provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible fo r coverage under JH&A's health insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations. 126. Educational Assistance JH&A recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the organization. Individual courses or courses that are part of a degree, licensing, or certification program must be"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,52,"related to the employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position in the organization in order to be eligible for educational assistance. JH&A has the sole discretion to determine whether a course relates to an employee's current job duties or a foreseeable-future position. Employees should contact Management for more information or questions about educational assistance and financial availability for educational assistance. The following pay guidelines will apply when employees are attending classes, seminars and educational courses, and their attendance is specifically required by Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning: - Employees attending company-required classes during their regular workday hours, Monday through Friday, will be paid a total of their hours worked and the hours spent in class and travel during the day. - Employees attending company-required classes commencing and ending after their regular"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,53,"workday hours, will be paid overtime wages for time spent in class beyond their regular 40 -hour work week. - Any courses pursued for personal development, which are not company mandated, can be considered to be financed through the company, but hourly wages will not be paid to the employee for their time. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 23 127. Paid Time OFF (PTO) Paid Time Off (PTO) is an all -purpose time-off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation, illness or injury, and personal business. It combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into one flexible, paid time -off policy. Employees in the foll owing employment classification(s) are eligible to earn and use PTO as described in this policy: - Regular full-time employees Once employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to accrue PTO according to the schedule below. Accrued PTO is available for use immediately after accrual. PTO can be"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,54,"used in minimum increments of one-half hour. The employee’s accrued balance will be capped at the maximum PTO balance amount listed in the PTO schedule. PTO accrued in excess of this maximum balance amount will be lost. Note: The amount of PTO accrued increases with the length of employment, as shown in the following schedule: Months of Eligible Service Completed PTO Hours Accrued Per Week Annual Rate of PTO Accrual (Hours) Maximum PTO Balance (Hours) 0 0 0 0 3 1.54 80 80 36 2.00 104 104 120 2.31 120 120 180 2.62 136 136 240 3.38 176 176 300 4.15 216 216 The length of eligible service is calculated based on a ""benefit year."" This is the 12-month period that begins when the employee starts to earn PTO. An employee's benefit year may be extended for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. Military leave has no effect on this calculation (see individual leave of absence policies for more information.) REQUESTS FOR PTO WAGES AND APPROVAL:"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,55,"REQUESTS FOR PTO WAGES AND APPROVAL: To schedule planned PTO of less than 5 consecutive working days, employees must submit a PTO request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 2 weeks of advance notice. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 24 To schedule planned PTO of 5 or more consecutive working days, employees must submit a PTO request form to their Supervisor with a minimum of 4 weeks of advance notice. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing requirements. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted as requested. Employees who have an unexpected need to be absent from work must notify their Supervisor before the start of the workday. If additional days of absence are then required, the employee must notify their Supervisor every additional day before the start of the workday with a phone call. An employee should not assume that PTO will be automatically granted, even in the case of"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,56,"emergency. PTO PAY RATES: PTO is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence. It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. PTO cannot be used in combination with base time to earn more than 40 hours per week. PTO must be entered into the employee’s timecard for the affected week. PTO not recorded on a timecard will not be awarded/paid. PTO is a “use -it-or-lose-it” benefit. Unused PTO will not be paid out to an employee for any reason. If an employee resigns and returns to employment at JH&A on later date, their eligibility for paid time off benefits will revert to that of a new employee. Personal time off without pay, family leave and Military Leave will have an effect on the calculation of accumulated PTO. Accumulation of PTO stops when an employee is absent during personal time off. 128. Health Insurance"

Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to participate in the health insurance plan: - Regular full-time employees JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 25 Eligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions of the agreement between JH&A and the insurance carrier. A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the health insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Refer to the Benefits Continuation (COBRA) policy for more information. Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An SPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,58,"employees. Contact the Administrative Office for more information abo ut health insurance benefits. 129. Timekeeping Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and state laws require JH&A to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Hourly nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They must also record the beginning and ending time of any departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must always be approved before it is performed. Time sheets are available in the office. If a specific day's time sheet is not available, employees should inform the office personnel immediately. It is the employee's responsibility to tum in their timecard on a timely basis. Failure to do so could result in a delay of pay."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,59,"result in a delay of pay. A time sheet must be turned in even when the employee is on vacation, out sick, or taking personal time off. The time sheet should be marked with an explanation of the absence. It is the employee's responsibility to sign their time sheet to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. Office personnel will review the time record for accuracy before payroll processing. If an employee has not correctly documented his or her time, cor rections will be made in the total hours worked, according to the stop and start times recorded. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 26 130. Paydays All employees are paid weekly. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed through the end of the previous payroll period. Our payroll period runs from Wednesday to Tuesday."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,60,"Tuesday. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a holiday, employees will receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday, unless the office personnel are unable to complete payroll due to unforeseen cir cumstances. In such case, employees will receive pay on the first day of work after the regularly scheduled payday. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee may receive his or her earned wages before departing for vacation if a written request is submitted to the office at least one week prior to departing for vacation. 131. Employment Terminations Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common circumstances under which employment is terminated: - Resignation - voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,61,"- Discharge - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization. - Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization for non - disciplinary reasons. Since employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent, both the employee and JH&A have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time. Employees will receive their final pay in accordance with applicable state law. Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid. Some benefits may be continued at the employee's expense if the employee so chooses. Th e employee will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations of such continuance.

All notice of potential work should be provided by management to the employee(s) by the afternoon prior in order to allow for the employee to have adequate preparation. 133. Administrative Pay Corrections JH&A takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of Management so that corrections can be made as quickly as possible. 134. Pay Deductions and Setoffs The law requires that JH&A make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. JH&A also must deduct Social"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,63,"Security taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security ""wage base.""

Eligible employees may voluntarily authorize deductions from their pay checks to cover the costs of participation in these programs. Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by JH&A, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to JH&A or others. Certain pay deductions, such as wage garnishments, credit union and insurance plans, art directed by law and cannot be altered by JH&A. Even though an employee may work a limited number of hours in a given payroll week, specific deductions must be made. Em ployees cannot choose to cancel certain deductions for a specific payroll period. If an employee does not have enough earned wages to support such a required payroll deduction, the deduction may be taken in the following weeks until the obligation is paid."

Safety To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and visitors, JH&A has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for JH&A. Management is responsible for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. An M.S.D.S. application (Material Safety Data Sheets) for materials and chemicals used in our workplace is also provided on smart devices in each vehicle. Employees may view the Safety Program Manual or the digital M.S.D.S. sheets at any time, and are resp onsible for maintaining access via single sign on through the provided application."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,65,"access via single sign on through the provided application. JH&A provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor -employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications. Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their supervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the President. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,66,"Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, employees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor. Such reports are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance an d workers' compensation benefits procedures. 136. Work Schedules JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 29 The normal work schedule for all employees is 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Supervisors will advise employees of the times their schedules will normally begin and end. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,67,"in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. 137. Use of Phone System & Cell Phones Personal use of a company telephone for long-distance and toll calls is not permitted. Employees should practice discretion when making local personal calls and may be required to reimburse JH&A for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone. Use of cell phones for personal calls during regular working hours is not permitted. Employees should practice discretion and inform their family and friends of the company's policy regarding this issue. Personal use of cell phones could lead to suspension and termination. Employees who have been assigned a cell phone will use it only for official company business. To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always employ customer service best practices. 138. Smoking In keeping with JH&A's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking in the"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,68,"workplace is discouraged. Nonsmoking areas are clearly designated where smoking is expressly prohibited, and employees are asked to respect these designations. I n situations where the preferences of smokers and nonsmokers are in direct conflict, the preferences of nonsmokers will prevail. A customer may prohibit smoking on his property. In these situations, the customer’s preference will prevail; smoking will not be allowed, except inside the company's vehicle. Smoking in the attic, under or inside the home of a customer is strictly prohibi ted, as is discarding cigarette butts, cigarette packages, or lighters. This policy applies equally to all employees, customers, and visitors. 139.

Emergency Closings"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,82,"143. Emergency Closings At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or hurricanes, can disrupt company operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of the work facility at JH&A. When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled work will be unpaid. However, with supervisory approval, employees may use available paid leave time, such as unused vacation benefits. If an emergency closing is not authorized, and JH&A remains open, employees who fail to report for work will not be paid for the time off. Employees in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are officially closed. In these circumstances, employees who work will receive regular pay. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 37 144. Business Travel Expenses JH&A will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,83,"assignments away from the normal work location. All business travel must be approved in advance by the Controller. Employees whose travel plans have been approved are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other expenses directly related to accomplishing business travel objectives will be reimbursed by JH&A. Employees are expected to limit expenses to reasonable amounts. Employees who are involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report the incident to their immediate supervisor. Vehicles owned, leased, or rented by JH&A may not be used for personal use without prior approval. Cash advances to cover reasonable anticipated expenses may be made to employees, after travel has been approved. Employees should submit a written request to their supervisor when travel advances are needed. When travel is completed, employees should submit completed travel expense repot1s within 30 days."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,84,"days. Reports should be accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses. Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related to travel arrangements, travel advances, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses, or any other business travel issues. Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including falsifying expense reports to reflect costs not incurred by the employee, can be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 145. Visitors in the Workplace To provide for the safety and security of employees and the facilities at JH&A, only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety standards, protects against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects confidential information, safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 38"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,85,"JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 38 All visitors should enter Jacob Sheet Metal Works or Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning at the main entrance. Authorized visitors will receive directions or be escorted to their destination. Employees are responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors. If an unauthorized individual is observed on company premises, employees should immediately notify their supervisor or, if necessary, direct the individual to the main entrance. 146. Computer and E-mail Usage Computers, computer files, the e -mail system, and software furnished to employees are JH&A property intended for business use. Employees should not use a password, access a file, or retrieve any stored communication without authorization. To ensure complia nce with this policy, computer and e-mail usage may be monitored. JH&A strives to maintain a workplace free of harassment and sensitive to the diversity of its"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,86,"employees. Therefore, JH&A prohibits the use of computers and the e -mail system in ways that are disruptive, offensive to others, or harmful to morale. For example, the display or transmission of sexually explicit images, messages, and cartoons is not allowed. Other such misuse includes, but is not limited to, ethnic slurs, racial comments, potentially offensive, or anything that may be construed as harassment or showing disrespect for others. E-mail may not be used to solicit others for commercial ventures, religious or political causes, outside organizations, or other non-business matters. Employees should notify their supervisor, the President or any member of management upon learning of violations of this policy. Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary· action, up to and including termination of employment. 147. Workplace Monitoring Workplace monitoring may be conducted by JH&A to ensure quality control, employee safety, security, and customer satisfaction."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,87,"security, and customer satisfaction. Computers furnished to employees are the property of JH&A. As such, computer usage and files may be monitored or accessed. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 39 JH&A may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. Video monitoring is used to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage or prevent acts of harassment and workplace violence. Because JH&A is sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of employees, every effort will be made to guarantee that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner. 148. Workplace Violence Prevention JH&A is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. Given the increasing violence in society in general, JH&A has adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or act ual) violence that may occur during"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,88,"business hours or on its premises. All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, ""horseplay,"" or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of JH&A without proper authorization. Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,89,"employees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work station, do not try to intercede or see what is happening. JH&A will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, JH&A may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation. Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,90,"violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 40 JH&A encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the attention of their supervisors or Management before the situation escalates into potential violence. JH&A is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees for raising such concerns. 149. Medical Leave JH&A provides medical leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who are temporarily unable to work due to a serious health condition or disability. For purposes of this policy, serious health conditions or disabilities include inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; continuing treatment by a health care provider; and temporary disabilities associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,91,"with pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request medical leave as described in this policy. - Regular full-time employees Eligible employees may request medical leave only after having completed 365 calendar days of service. Exceptions to the service requirement will be considered to accommodate disabilities. Eligible employees should make requests for medical leave to their supervisors at least 30 days in advance of foreseeable events and as soon as possible for unforeseeable events. A health care provider's statement must be submitted verifying the need for medical leave and its beginning and expected ending dates. Any changes in this information should be promptly reported to JH&A. Employees returning from medical leave must submit a health care provider's verification of their fitness to return to work. Eligible employees are normally granted leave for the period of the disability, up to a maximum of"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,92,"6 weeks within any 12-month period. Any combination of medical leave and family leave may not exceed this maximum limit. If the initial period of approved ab sence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a request for an extension. Employees will be required to first use any accrued paid leave time before taking unpaid medical leave. Employees who sustain work-related injuries are eligible for a medical leave of absence for the period of disability in accordance with all applicable laws covering occupational disabilities. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits will be provided by JH&A until the end of the month in which the medical leave begins. At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 41 lo continue. When the employee returns from medical leave, benefits will again be provided by"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,93,"JH&A according to the applicable plans. The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during the leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as Dental, AFLAC, and disability plans must continue to be paid by our company in order for the plans to stay in effect. Employees taking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A while off work. Every effort will be made to keep these supplemental plans in force. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the leave and will resume upon return to active employment. So that an employee's return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on medical leave is requested to provide JH&A with at least two weeks’ advance notice of the date the employee intends to return to work. When a medical leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same position, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified. ."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,94,"If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed upon return date, JH&A will assume that the employee has resigned. 150. Family Leave JH&A provides family leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off from work duties to fulfill family obligations relating directly to childbirth, adoption, or placement of a foster child; or to care for a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition. A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or continuing treatment by a health care provider.

Personal & Bereavement Leave JH&A will consider leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off from work duties to fulfill personal obligations. Employees in the following employment classification(s) are eligible to request personal leave as described in this policy: - Regular full-time employees Eligible employees may request personal leave only after having completed 90 calendar days of service. As soon as eligible employees become aware of the need for a personal leave of absence, they should request a leave from Management."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,97,"absence, they should request a leave from Management. Personal leave may be granted for a period of not to exceed 5 calendar days per one-year period. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single extension of no more than 3 calendar days. With the supervisor's approval, an employee must take any available vacation paid time off first as part of the approved period. Requests for personal leave will be evaluated based on a number of factors, including anticipated work load requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence. Employees should not assume they will be granted their request for personal time off. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits will be provided by Il-I&A until the end of the month in which the approved personal leave begins. At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,98,"coverage to continue. When the employee returns from personal leave, benefits will again be provided by JH&A according to the-applicable plans. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 43 The employee should be aware that credit union or Simple IRA deductions will not occur during the leave of absence. But employee supplemental plans such as AFLAC, dental, and disability plans must continue to be paid by the Company in order for the plan to stay in effect. Employees taking a leave of absence will be required to reimburse JH&A in such cases. Every effort will be made to keep these supplemental plans in force. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the leave and will resume upon return to active employment. When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the same position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,99,"However, JH&A cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period, JH&A will assume the employee has resigned. Each employee is eligible for bereavement leave of up to 3 business days for direct family (parents, siblings, grandparents, children). Bereavement leave does not apply to non-direct family members, and PTO usage would be required for anyone outside of these parameters. 152. Employee Conduct and Work Rules To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, JH&A expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization. It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment:"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,100,"up to and including termination of employment: - Unsafe or negligent operation of company-owned vehicles. - Excessive traffic violations. - Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property - Falsification of timekeeping records - Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs - Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 44 - Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace - Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace - Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of e1nployer -owned or customer - owned property - Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct - Violation of safety or health rules - Smoking in prohibited areas - Sexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment - Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace"

Drug and Alcohol Use It is JH&A's desire to provide a drug -free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner. While on JH&A premises and while conducting business-related activities off JH&A premises, no employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,102,"The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 45 Violations this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Such violations may also have legal consequences. To inform employees about important provisions of this policy, JH&A has established a drug-free awareness program. The program provides information on the dangers and effects of substance abuse in the workplace, resources available to employees, and conseq uences for violations of this policy. Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,103,"to use the resources of the Employee Assistance Program. They may also wish to discuss these matters with their supervisor or the President to receive assistance or ref errals to appropriate resources in the community. Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program through JH&A's health insurance benefit coverage. Leave may be granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all JH&A policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the leave will not cause JH&A any undue hardship. Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should raise their concerns with their supervisor or the President without fear of reprisal. 154. Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,104,"154. Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment JH&A is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will no t be tolerated. As an example, sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of employee misconduct that is demeaning to another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly prohibited. Any employee who wants to report an incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment should promptly report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the employee believes it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately contact the President or any other member of management. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 46"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,105,"JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 46 Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment should promptly advise the President or any member of management who will handle the matter in a timely and confidential manner. Anyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 155. Attendance and Punctuality To maintain a safe and productive work environment, JH&A expects employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. Absenteeism and tardiness places a burden on other employees and on JH&A. In the rare instance when an employee ca nnot avoid being late to work or is unable to work as scheduled, he or she must notify their supervisor as soon as possible. It is imperative to notify the office staff, as well as the manager, in order to minimize business disruption."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,106,"business disruption. Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Either may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 156. Personal Appearance Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the business image JH&A presents to customers and visitors. During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work inappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in pr oper attire. Under such circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work. PROPER WORK CLOTHING INCLUDES: - Uniform clothing including shirts, polo shirts, T -shirts, pants, blue jeans and shorts, issued by Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning and branded accordingly. - Jackets and coveralls provided by JH&A. - Baseball caps provided by JH&A."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,107,"- Baseball caps provided by JH&A. - Work shoes or boots, provided by the employee.

Cut-offs, torn or tattered blue jeans are not allowed. Consult your supervisor or the Controller if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate attire. ASSIGNMENT OF UNIFORMS: Upon completion of the Probation Period (or before, if deemed by supervisor), Regular Employees will be assigned uniforms. Office Personnel will receive the appropriate shirts. All other employees will be supplied uniforms through the uniform service. Safe footwear is the responsibility of each employee. 1. Maintenance on all uniforms will be performed by the employee. If necessary, arrangements for repairs can be made through JH&A; contact management. 2. The replacement of uniforms will be made by JH&A as management deems necessary."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,108,"The employee is expected to take due care and is responsible for lost articles. Damages to uniforms will be reviewed on a case-to-case basis. 3. If an employee leaves his/her employment with JH&A, or is terminated, all items must be returned. The employee will be held financially accountable for any missing items. Jacob Heating & Air Conditioning reserves the right to change the uniform plan at any time, to add or change the requirements, and to select services outside of the company, as management deems necessary. 157. Return of Property Employees are responsible for items issued to them by JH&A or in their possession or control, such as the following: - company training materials - client lists - credit cards - company-owned equipment & tools - keys - manuals JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 48 - pagers - protective equipment - uniforms - price books & any written company materials"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,109,"- uniforms - price books & any written company materials All JH&A property must be returned by employees on or before their last day of work. Where permitted by applicable laws, JH&A may withhold from the employee's check or final paycheck the cost of any items that are not returned when required. JH&A may also take all action deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property. 158. Resignation Resignation is a voluntary act initiated by the employee to terminate employment with JH&A. Although advance notice is not required, JH&A requests at least 2 weeks written resignation notice from all employees. Prior to an employee's departure, an exit interview may be scheduled to discuss the reasons for resignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits. 159. Security Inspections JH&A wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms, explosives, or other improper materials. To this end, JH&A prohibits the possession, transfer,"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,110,"sale, or use of such materials on its premises. JH&A requires the cooperation of all employees in administering this policy. Company vehicles, desks, drawers, bins, and other storage devices may be provided for the convenience of employees but remain the sole property of JH&A. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or represen tative of JH&A at any time, either with or without prior notice. JH&A likewise wishes to discourage theft or unauthorized possession of the property of employees, JH&A, visitors, and customers. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, JH&A or its representative may inspect not only company vehicles, desks, and drawers but also persons entering and/or leaving the premises and any packages or other belongings. Any employee who JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 49 wishes to avoid inspection of any articles or materials should not bring such items onto JH&A's premises. 160. Solicitation"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,111,"premises. 160. Solicitation In an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by JH&A may not solicit or distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose. JH&A recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the workplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities during working time. (Working time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other periods in which employees are not on duty.) In addition, the posting of written solicitations on company bulletin boards is restricted. These bulletin boards display important information, and employees should consult them frequently for: - Employee announcements - Internal memoranda - Organization announcements - Workers' compensation insurance information - State disability insurance/unemployment insurance information."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,112,"If employees have a message of interest to the workplace, they may submit it to the Controller for approval. All approved messages will be posted by the Controller. 161. Drug Testing JH&A is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all employees. Using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job may pose serious safety and health risks. To help ensure a safe and healthful working environment, job applicants and employees may be asked to provide body substance samples (such as urine and/or blood) to determine the illicit or illegal use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, in a case where a Worker’s Comp claim is submitted, drug or alcoh ol screening may be required. Refusal to submit to drug testing may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides confidential counseling and referral services"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,113,"to employees for assistance with such problems as drug and/or alcohol abuse or addiction. It is JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 50 the employee's responsibility to seek assistance from the EAP prior to reaching a point where his or her judgment, performance, or behavior has led to imminent disciplinary action. Participation in the EAP after the disciplinary process has begun may not p reclude disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Copies of the drug testing policy will be provided to all employees. Employees will be asked to sign an acknowledgement form indicating that they have received a copy of the drug testing policy. Questions concerning this policy or its administration should be directed to the Controller. 162. Progressive Discipline The purpose of this policy is to stale JH&A's position on administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfacto1y conduct in the workplace. The best disciplinary measure is the one"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,114,"that does not have to be enforced and comes from good leadersh ip and fair supervision at all employment levels. JH&A's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory service in the future. Although employment with JH&A is based on mutual consent and both the employee and JH&A have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, JH&A may use progressive discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed."
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,115,"Progressive discipline means that, with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally be followed: a first offense may call for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning; another offense may lead to a suspensi on; and, still another offense may then lead to termination of employment. JH&A recognizes that there are certain types of employee problems that are serious enough to justify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual progressive discipline steps. While it is impossible to list every type of behavior that may be deemed a serious offense, the Employee Conduct and Work Rules policy includes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension or termination of employment. However, the problems listed are not all JACOB Heating & Air Conditioning Employee Handbook 51 necessarily serious offenses, but may be examples of unsatisfactory conduct that will trigger"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,116,"progressive discipline. By using progressive discipline, we hope that most employee problems can be corrected at an early stage, benefiting both the employee and JH&A. 163. Life-Threatening Illnesses in the Workplace Employees with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. JH&A supports these endeavors as long as employees are able to meet acceptable performance standards and don’t pose a health risk to other employees. As in the case of other disabilities, JH&A will make reasonable accommodations in accordance with all legal requirements, to allow qualified employees with life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs. Medical information on individual employees is treated confidentially. JH&A will take reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other"
Jacob.pdf,Jacob,117,"employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment."

Your department head will show you the location of your department bulletin board and the place where work schedules are posted. Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the work schedule and to report ready to work, on time. Changes to the schedule may be necessary from time to time. Although an employee is not required to come in on their day off, your cooperation is appreciated. Working as a team means that you will cover for a sick employee, knowing that perhaps the situation will be reversed in the future and that employee will cover for you. If personal circumstances require it, you may request a schedule change. It is your responsibility to arrange a fill-in for the shift(s) you will miss. The replacement must be from the same department and requires at least 24-hour advance notice to your department head"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,42,".

Overtime Schedules are determined by the GM or department heads on a weekly basis and employees should clock in and out according to that schedule.

Overtime will be paid at the rate of time and a half for hours exceeding 40 between Sunday at 12:01 a.m. and Saturday at 12:00 midnight. Overtime hours will be paid for only once.

Employees must notify their department head of an intended absence as soon as is known, but in any event at least four hours before their scheduled starting time. This procedure must be followed for each day of absence. Failure to notify management of an expected absence may be considered a no-call, no-show situation and will result in a warning notice and counseling on attendance for the employee. If an employee doesn't show up for three shifts in a row, without notification to management of any kind, it will be determined that they have quit their job. In addition, failure to report to work for three days (consecutive or otherwise) during any three consecutive months, without authorization, may result in discharge without prior warning."

Employees are required to punch out for their half-hour break. Employee Travel and Reimbursement Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with approved travel on behalf of the company. Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses and exercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,47,". If a circumstance arises that is not specifically covered in the travel policies, the most conservative course of action should be adopted. Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Upon completion of the trip, and within 30 days, the traveler must submit a Travel Reimbursement Form and supporting documentation to obtain reimbursement of expenses.

Be aware of any tendencies in these regards and remember that safety is the priority. We also advise every employee to take note of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks.

It is your responsibility to read the notebook and become familiar with proper safety procedures.

Security Security is vital to the property. It is everyone's responsibility to take precautions in order to prevent theft and to ensure the safety of our guests and fellow employees. There are many ways to make this property a safer place: • Report suspicious people to the front desk immediately. If you feel at all uncomfortable, do not hesitate to contact the front desk and report the situation. Do not approach the person if you are uncomfortable"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,67,". Do not approach the person if you are uncomfortable. If you do choose to approach someone who looks like they don't belong, you may want to say something like, ""Hello, can I help you find something?'' If they respond that they don't need help, you might ask them (as if you were just carrying on a light conversation), ""Are you a guest here?'' If you smile and ask in a non-threatening way, you will not be as likely to offend a legitimate guest. However, if the person continues to act strangely, call it in. It is always better to err on the side of caution. • Always wear your name tag, making identification easier for our guests. • Do not prop doors open, especially back entrances, stairwells, and exits. • Never give out employees' home addresses or phone numbers. Direct any calls requesting information about an employee to the Director of Human Resources or the General Manager. • Never give out guest information, such as names, room numbers, etc"

An employee who fails to perform satisfactorily during this time may be terminated without notice. In some situations, the employee may receive a training wage during their introductory period. Performance Reviews Periodically, written performance reviews will be given by your department head. A performance review will normally be given at least once a year and will be placed in your personnel file. Performance reviews do not always result in a pay increase."

Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,83,"Discipline Every employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by existing rules and policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/her duties to the best of his/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her job description or as otherwise established. When policies and procedures are not being followed, it is the responsibility of your department head or the general manager to correct the situation. This will take the form of coaching/counseling; or more formal verbal and/or written warnings. The Hotel reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling and/or training; the employee's work record; and the impact the conduct and performance issues have on our organization"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,84,". Initially, when an employee displays unacceptable behavior or his/her performance is not meeting the job requirements, the employee will be made aware of the situation and be given an opportunity to correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time. In some cases, this initial contact may include a verbal warning. A verbal warning will occur if previous coaching has not corrected the problem or if the initial issue is sufficiently serious. The warning will be noted in the employee's personnel records. A written warning is given when your department head or the general manager believes that an offense is sufficiently serious or when a verbal warning has proven insufficient. The written warning may also include a notation indicating that the next similar transgression will result in termination. You should recognize the grave nature of the written warning"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,85,". You should recognize the grave nature of the written warning. If you feel the warning is inaccurate or unwarranted, you may respond, in writing, and your response will be attached to the written warning and placed in your personnel file. An employee may be terminated if he/she has three written warnings, for any reason, in their file. For problems deemed to be serious enough, or for failure to respond appropriately to prior counseling and warnings, suspension and/or termination may occur. If suspended, the employee will be expected to leave the premises immediately and remain off work, without pay, for the duration of their suspension. If an employee is terminated, they will be expected to leave the premises immediately. A final paycheck will be issued the same day (or the next business day if termination happens on a weekend). Prior to receiving their final check, the employee must tum in hotel keys, uniforms, name badges, and any other hotel property in their possession"

Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,94,"GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES Employee Conduct Employees are expected to treat our guests, customers, and one another with respect and understanding. Any rudeness (e.g., profanity, yelling, use of vulgar or obscene language, suggestive or sarcastic gestures) will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Do not talk about company issues in public areas and by no means discuss any grievances with guests. Dating/Marriage Policy Dating or marriage to a coworker in today's business, legal and social environment has an impact beyond the otherwise simple relationship between two people. Among the various factors complicating matters, the following three ""risks"" are readily apparent. Risk to the business, reflected in three main areas: 1. Financial defalcation 2. Inappropriate influence over decision making Judgment 23"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,95,"3. Compromising operational policies/procedures 4. Risk to employee morale, reflected in actual or perceived favoritism. 5. Risk of sexual harassment suits. As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the workplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to protect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the intent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject, thereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management. This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital): 1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person: a. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 2"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,96,". 2. Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the connection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential conflict of interest by compromising any of the following: a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more ""senior"" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to communicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject that responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral reassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for the purpose of working out details of a reassignment. Every attempt will be made, subject to prudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior"" positions"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,97,". There is always a risk, however, that one or the other person will have to leave the property. In that event, and if available, a job will be offered at another Alta Hotel Group hotel. Guest Privacy Employees may never divulge the names of our guests to anyone. Solicitation is not allowed on premise by employees, guests or visitors. Guest room numbers are never to be given out. An employee is in a position to observe the personal actions of many people. It is mandatory that you never discuss your observations either within or outside the property. However, should you notice anything detrimental to the property or its guests, notify your department head, the General Manager immediately. Keep in mind that all guest services (pool, fitness center, lobby, van, etc.) are for guest use only, unless otherwise allowed by the GM"

Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,99,"Under no circumstances is an employee to be in a guest room with a guest in a social situation unless specifically allowed by the General Manager. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Leaving Property during Work Hours It is recognized that, at times, an employee must leave the property during working hours to conduct personal business.

Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property. 2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning. 3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns.

If available, the employee may meet his/her visitor in the lobby or other public area. Visitors will not be permitted in work areas or guest rooms. Nonemployees may be allowed to visit employee areas only with prior approval of management or as part of a company-sponsored program. These visits should not disrupt workflow. An employee must accompany the nonemployee at all times"
Alta Peruvian.pdf,Alta Peruvian,101,". An employee must accompany the nonemployee at all times. Former employees are not permitted onto company property except for official company business.

Employee Handbook Page 4 of 42 I.YOUR HANDBOOK An Introduction This handbook is provided to each employee as a guide to the Company’s policies and procedures. It is not intended to create, and should not be construed as creating, a contract between the Company and any one or all of its employees. All employees are employed on an at-will basis. At-will employment means that either the Company or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without prior notice, for any reason not otherwise prohibited by law. Any representation to the contrary is not binding on the Company unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the Company. Please read this handbook carefully. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the Company for your benefit. One of our primary objectives for"

We believe you will find an abundance of resources in this handbook that will help you achieve your personal and professional goals. Our employee handbook cannot possibly anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise, and it should not be considered as the only or final source of information. It does replace all prior handbooks and related publications previously distributed. As questions arise, we ask that you consult with your manager or a human resources representative for further information about a policy, guideline, or any other information regarding your employment that may or may not be contained in this publication. As we continue to grow, and as our business environment continues to change, there may be a need to change the policies, guidelines, and benefits described in this handbook. As such, we reserve the right to"

II. ABOUT LUND FOOD HOLDINGS, INC. Every Company has its own unique culture, which shapes for each of its employees how it feels to be part of that Company’s working family. At Lund Food Holdings, Inc., our culture is a composite of our vision for the Company, our mission statement, and our shared values. A brief introduction of these business philosophies follows and includes insights about their importance in the LFHI workplace and how they are incorporated into our everyday business environments. OUR VISION Our vision for the Company identifies what it is we are striving to achieve and what we ultimately want the Company to be. As valued members of our Company’s workforce, each of us has the opportunity"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,21,"and a responsibility to direct our personal work activities in support of this vision. To be the predominant upscale provider of food and services in every market of choice. Lund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook Page 5 of 42 OUR MISSION Our Mission Statement was created by a team of employees shortly after Lunds and Byerlys united. They set out to answer the question “what is it that we do?” You will notice the icon that’s used to convey our Company’s mission looks like a person and an exclamation point is incorporated into the design. The icon signifies the importance of each person in our Company – employees make sensational service happen and employees create what we call the “WOW!” factor. Everyone has a role in this. As you read our mission statement, we ask that you think about what it is that you will do to make our mission come alive. Together One Company, two brands (store formats), and the connection of all entities: stores, production facilities"

We thrive on the power and passion of our employees by enthusiastically encouraging and preparing them to be successful. We judge ourselves by our beliefs and intentions, while others judge us by our behaviors and actions."
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,23,"The values, which guide our business practices, were identified by the Company’s owner, Tres Lund, and its executive team members. These values represent a set of beliefs and principles that govern the manner in which we work together and the ways in which we conduct our business. Respect, honesty and integrity, empowerment, innovation, safety, development and communication are Company values that we bring to life by supporting them and practicing them. Teamwork means collaboration in and with all levels is the key to our success. “Together Everyone Achieves More.” Lund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook Page 6 of 42 Respect means honoring all the diversity in our work environment and includes coworkers, customers, vendors, and our communities. It means consideration of others’ feelings, concerns and ideas. “People with humility don’t think less of themselves, they just think about themselves less.” “Sometimes when the numbers look right the decision is still wrong.”"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,24,"Innovation means continually striving to improve our processes, our products, and our quality, and helping our coworkers do their job better. “Managing only for profit is like trying to play tennis with your eye on the scoreboard and not on the ball.” OUR HISTORY Both Lunds and Byerlys have a rich history, beginning as Minnesota companies founded by local families. Lunds grew out of a vision that Russell Lund, Sr. had while working at Hove’s, a local supermarket back in 1922. He decided to venture out on his own in 1939 and began the business with the first Lunds store on Lake Street in Minneapolis. Don Byerly, the founder of Byerlys, grew up in a grocery family and opened his first store in Golden Valley in 1968. Both businesses continued to grow and prosper and eventually united as a single Company in 1997. The new Company, which includes supermarkets, manufacturing facilities and real estate holdings, is"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,25,"owned by the Lund family and is led by Russell T. Lund III (Tres), grandson of founder Russell Lund, Sr. Lund Food Holdings, Inc. is a dynamic collection of businesses that are poised for growth and continued prosperity for the 21st century and beyond. MEDIA PHILOSOPHY It is not uncommon for our Company to be contacted by the media when stories about food products or other public interest events are unfolding. When communicating with the media, it is essential that we speak in one clear voice, meaning that all responses need to be consistent and coordinated from a Company-wide point of view. To assure this consistency, all media inquiries must be referred to your location manager who will pass them on to an officer of the Company. For further information regarding the media, refer to the media policy or contact the corporate support office. III. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER"

Accordingly, our Company is committed to being an equal opportunity employer and providing a work environment free from all forms of discrimination for applicants and employees, and reaffirms its adherence to a policy of equal employment opportunity with respect to all persons regardless of race, color, gender, age, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, military status, gender identity, or any other basis protected by law. Lund Food Holdings, Inc.

Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,27,"and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment. This policy applies to all classifications of full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and on-call part-time employment. If you believe that you have been subject to unlawful discrimination, or if you witness an activity or process that you believe represents unlawful discrimination, you are responsible to report it to your department manager or general manager immediately, or to human resources. You can raise concerns and/or make reports regarding discrimination, harassment, and/or equal employment opportunity without fear of reprisal or retaliation. And, you can be assured that your complaint will be investigated promptly, in an objective and confidential manner. Anyone found to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including separation from employment as determined at management’s discretion. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,28,"REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES Our Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state law prohibiting discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. It is our policy not to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such individual’s disability or perceived disability so long as the employee/applicant can perform the essential functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, we will provide reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by applicable federal and state law, who has made us aware of his or her disability, so that the individual may perform the essential functions of his or her position. The Company will do so provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship for the Company. Your medical information is treated confidentially and maintained separately from your personnel file."
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,29,"The Company will take all reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. Management and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of all employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment as determined at management’s discretion. Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of their job should request an accommodation through their management. This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Again, the Company is committed to taking all actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE Our Company is committed to employing only United States citizens and non-residents who are"

RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE As part of our strong stand and value set with respect to our EEO, discrimination and harassment policies, all of us have an obligation and duty to be proactive, intervening and addressing any acts that may be potentially offensive or inappropriate particularly from a race and/or religious basis. This"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,31,"includes intervening when you hear jokes or comments that could be offensive to certain groups or classes of individuals. It also means being alert to recognizing inappropriate signs or symbols that might be displayed or written on cartons, pallets, walls or in other more obscure areas, taking action by reporting them to your manager so steps can be taken to investigate their origin and to remove them. It also includes recognizing processes, systems, or procedures that might be exclusionary or discriminatory and reporting such to your manager to take action to correct the situation. The key message is: Be proactive and address issues by reporting them to your manager as you see them occur. We all are responsible for providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and intolerant acts, while maintaining the highest levels of respect, teamwork and innovation. RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION"
Lunds_and_Byerlys.pdf,Lunds and Byerlys,32,"RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION For those employees who can provide proof of strongly held religious beliefs, the Company will reasonably accommodate religious-based requests with respect to work schedule, breaks, position assignment, or other work-related activities provided such requests do not impose an undue hardship on the work and/or operational needs of the business.

EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL All employees are employees-at-will except as otherwise provided through a union contract or an employment agreement signed by an officer of the Company. This means that the employment relationship is non-contractual, for no fixed period of time, and is terminable at any time by either you as the employee or the Company as your employer at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice.

Our employee referral program provides you with the opportunity to earn a bonus (less applicable taxes) for every employee that you refer that becomes employed by the Company. Check with your location manager for specific information regarding the referral program. EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND ROOMMATES Family members, significant others, and roommates are a good source of referrals and future employees.

For example, resting your foot on a grocery cart while cashiering, keeping your hands in a neutral position while performing repetitive tasks, and using a long-handled utensil when scooping and stirring products can increase your comfort. Here are some tips to help protect you from repetitive injury:  Stretch before beginning work activities  Rotate tasks whenever possible  Change position frequently — taking 10-second mini-breaks will help do this  Avoid forceful movement  Use both hands whenever possible  Avoid excessive reaching  Use a ladder or stepstool to reduce reach  Change grips often  Increase periods of repetitive motion to allow for physical conditioning  Raise or lower work, if possible, to make it more comfortable Did You Know?  If we take care in the beginning, the end will take care of itself.

Lund Food Holdings, Inc. Employee Handbook Page 40 of 42 Stretching and Mini-Breaks – Stretching increases flexibility and helps to promote circulation and range of motion while decreasing muscle stiffness and fatigue. When you do stretches, you ultimately decrease the risk of injury. There are several simple stretches that can be done at work. Usually static stretching — which involves extending a muscle to its full range and holding it at that position for 15-30 seconds — is the easiest to do in a work setting. The following stretches may be familiar as “warm-ups” to those of you who are active in sports or strengthening programs:  Head/Neck Roll — Slowly bend chin to chest. Look over right shoulder. Look up toward ceiling. Look over left shoulder. Repeat 2-4 times."

Repeat 3-5 times.  Elbow Press for Middle Back — Bring your elbows out to side at chest height. Pull them slowly backward to get maximum stretch. Hold, then release. Do 3-5 times.  Back Extension — Stand and bend backward into extension with hands placed on lower back for support. Hold and release. Repeat 3-5 times.  Leg Stretches — While seated, raise right leg up with knee bent, and then lower leg. Do the same with your left leg. Repeat 3-5 times.  Wrist Circles — Slowly rotate hands up, down and around in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.  Ankle Circles — One at a time, rotate ankles in circles. Repeat 3-5 times.

Use these safe lifting techniques:  Stretch  Lift safely  Get a firm footing; keep feet shoulder-width apart. Wear non-slip shoes like Shoes For Crews® — ask your manager about them.  Bend your knees, squat down keeping back as straight as possible; lift with your legs.  Grip load and keep close to your body; avoid twisting.  Know your limits — don’t attempt to lift more than you are capable of lifting; ask others for help; use cart or other device to help you or make extra trips. Regular exercise is also key to a healthy back. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise program, and ask him/her to show you special back-strengthening exercises.

If this information is requested, it must be provided within 14 calendar days.

This meeting will be an opportunity to discuss the requested change, its impact, and any practical considerations involved in implementing the request. There may be some requests that we are immediately happy to agree to, and in these cases a formal meeting may not be necessary. If you fail to attend the meeting, and a rearranged meeting without good reason, we will consider the application as having been withdrawn. Following the meeting, we will then give serious consideration to your request and reply formally in writing. If your request is accepted, it will constitute a permanent change to your terms and conditions of employment and you will receive a letter to sign, confirming this. In some circumstances we may suggest a trial period for the new working conditions. There is no obligation on us to accept requests for flexible working, however, if we decide not to accept any request, we will invite you to a further meeting to explain why."

You will be invited to an appeal hearing to put your case and again you may be accompanied by a work colleague.

This information provides important information about your pension and details how you can an “opt out” of the pension, if you so wish. 2.12 Sickness Policy 2.12.1 For Contract Manager’s and Head Office Staff If you are absent from work due to sickness or injury the Company will pay full pay for the first 3 days of absence (up to a maximum of 3 days per calendar year) and Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) only for the remainder, provided you have complied with the relevant statutory and Company rules relating to sickness absence and notification."

There are specific qualifying regulations for the payment of SSP, where payment will be made as a result of sickness of more than 4 or more consecutive days. Under the government SSP scheme, the first 3 qualifying days of sickness are called “waiting days” and therefore you will not be paid for the first 3 days of sickness. SSP will therefore be paid from day 4 of absence. SSP will be paid for up to 28 weeks of “linked absence”. “Linked absence” is where periods of absence occur with less than 8 weeks between them. Where absences are “linked” you will not need"

We therefore have Employees of the Month and a Support Star of the Season (for Head Office and Operations staff), where employees are rewarded with a bonus and receive a personal letter of thanks from the CEO. In addition, the Company has an annual Clean Space Award for Outstanding Service Delivery where the best three cleaners receive a bonus and an award for exemplary service. 2.14 Career Development The Company encourages career development for its staff and where possible endeavours to promote internal staff to vacancies, if they meet specific skill levels (core competencies) required for"

It should be noted progression to the more senior roles is dependent upon a vacancy being available. We believe in providing opportunities for those staff that wish to develop and build their career and a number of Cleaners have progressed within the Company to become Supervisors and to more senior roles."

This section lays out the policies and procedures we have established in order to uphold our values, retain our customer’s trust and help you to perform your duties. Further details of our policies and procedures can also be found in specific work manuals or policies, which are available via your line manager. 3.1 Leave 3.1.1 Jury Service/Witness Summons If you are required to attend for jury service, are summoned as a witness, or are obliged by law to attend court, the company must give you time off to carry out your public duty. Whilst you are carrying out jury service or acting as a witness following a summons you will not be paid by the company or the court, however you can claim loss of earnings from the court. The company will complete a ""Certificate of Loss of Earnings"" to facilitate your claim. Time off for jury service should be discussed with your Line Manager in the first instance."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,65,"be discussed with your Line Manager in the first instance. In the event that you are advised that a particular court case may be prolonged (e.g. last more than one week), you should request dispensation from being a juror for this case. In the event that dispensation is not granted then you should inform your Line Manager and give details of the expected duration of the case. 3.1.2 Time Off for Public Duties You are entitled to reasonable unpaid leave of absence to perform the following public duties: Justice of the Peace and membership of a recognised public or statutory body stipulated in the Employment Rights Act 1996. 3.1.3 Medical or Dental Appointments If you are required to attend a non-emergency medical appointment, or visit a dentist or optician, you should make these appointments outside work hours. If this cannot be arranged, then you should inform your Line Manager as soon as possible. Appointments should be arranged when cover"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,66,"is available, or towards the beginning or end of the working day. We may also change the work rota to allow you to attend the appointment. Such appointments will be unpaid. 3.2 Attendance and Timekeeping The Company expects you to be ready to start work on time. If in exceptional circumstances you are unable to attend work in designated start time, you must telephone your Line Manager immediately. If staff are late for work this means that colleagues are put under additional pressure to cover duties, will give a very poor impression to our customers and we could ultimately lose business. Therefore, lateness and absence will be recorded and unacceptable levels of timekeeping and attendance, or failure to inform the Line Manager of absence will constitute misconduct, which may result in disciplinary action. Attendance will be monitored. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 29 You are not allowed to leave your place of work except during authorised breaks or with the"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,67,"permission of your line manager. Leaving your place of work without authorisation may lead to disciplinary action. 3.3 Sickness and Absence 3.3.1 Notification of Absence If you are absent from work, we will always try to provide support in times of genuine need. Absence however does put your colleagues under pressure, and it affects the quality of the service we are able to provide. Our procedures are therefore designed to provide you with support whilst minimising the disruption absence can cause. As soon as you know you cannot come into work and at least two hours before your shift starts you must call your Line Manager, personally by telephone, giving the reason for your absence and how long you think you may be absent for. If your line manager is not available, you should telephone your line manager’s manager. The line manager will then inform central HR of the absence and will follow up by informing HR"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,68,"when the employee has returned to work, or a Statement of Fitness for Work (Fit Note) has been received. You should keep your Line Manager regularly informed of your absence and you will be required to telephone your Line Manager personally on a daily basis for the first week of absence and then at a frequency agreed with your line manager thereafter. Leaving voicemail or electronic messages, sending texts or asking someone else to phone on your behalf are not acceptable, unless there are exceptional circumstances. It is essential that you comply with the above procedures, so that we can make arrangements to cover your absence, to minimise any disruption to our business and to maintain a reasonable workload for your colleagues. You are expected to make every effort to return to work quickly and during any absence you should not work elsewhere or carry out activities inconsistent with your condition and which may delay"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,69,"your return to work. By this we mean activities such as sports, inappropriate social activities, home improvements or doing any other paid work. If a Statement of Fitness for Work (known as a “Fit Note”) issued by the employee’s doctor recommends any adjustments to the employee’s duties, hours of work or working conditions to facilitate the employee’s return to work, the employee is required to cooperate with the Company to implement such changes. It is the Company’s policy to support employees who are genuinely sick and unable to come to work and where possible reasonable adjustments will be considered to facilitate the return to work. Where an employee is absent for more than four weeks this will be considered long term absence and will be managed accordingly. For example, we will request your consent to obtain a medical report from your GP or for you to be examined by an occupational health specialist or specialist consultant.

Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 30 Ultimately, we may have no option but to terminate employment on the grounds of capability if there is no reasonable prognosis of a return to work and the continued absence cannot be sustained by the business. In such circumstances we will explore all reasonable adjustments to help the employee return to work, with medical advice, and termination of employment will be a last resort. If there is evidence that any sickness is not genuine, disciplinary action will be taken up to and including dismissal for gross misconduct. 3.3.2 Self Certification You must complete the Company’s Sickness Absence Form (see below) and forward this to your Line Manager for every period of sickness absence, including any individual days (or half days) of sickness. Failure to do so may result in you not receiving any sick pay for this absence. 3.3.3 Statement of Fitness for Work (Fit Note)"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,71,"3.3.3 Statement of Fitness for Work (Fit Note) If you are unable to attend work for more than seven consecutive days (including weekends and bank holidays), you will be required to obtain a Statement of Fitness for Work (“Fit Note”) which must be signed by a qualified GP (Doctor), giving details of the nature of your illness and the estimated length of your absence from work. The Fit Note should be forwarded to your line manager. You must provide continuous Fit Notes for the full period of absence when it exceeds 7 consecutive days (including weekends and bank holidays). Failure to provide continuous Fit Notes may be deemed as unauthorised absence which may result in disciplinary action. 3.3.4 Return to Work Interview On your return to work, following absence for sickness or injury, you must attend an interview with your Line Manager if requested to do so. The purpose of which will be to discuss the reason for your"

The meeting can also establish whether the Line Manager can provide any support to help facilitate your attendance at work. 3.3.5 Medical Reports and Independent Medical Examination Where it is considered necessary, the Company reserves the right to ask you to consent to us applying for a medical report from your GP or for you to undergo an independent medical examination by an occupational health specialist or specialist consultant, at the expense of the Company. In the event that a medical report or examination is required you will be asked to give your consent for your Doctor, specialist or independent practitioner to be contacted. Any such request for medical information will be subject to the employee’s rights under the Access to Medical Records Act 1988. Any refusal to consent means that we will have to potentially make decisions on your future"

We strongly believe that this is not in the best interest of employees. 3.3.6 Serious Infectious/Contagious Illness If you are suffering from a serious infectious or contagious illness (e.g. chickenpox or measles), you must not report to work without obtaining approval from your line manager. If in doubt, please notify us and consult your Doctor. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 31 3.3.7 Minor Ailments Minor ailments such as colds and headaches can be the most manageable of conditions. Self-care with advice from a pharmacist are the quickest and most effective way to relieve symptoms to allow you to continue to work. However, if you are unsure about your condition you should visit your Doctor. Alternatively, you can call the NHS 111 helpline. Just dial 111 for this service which is open 24 hours. 3.3.8 Extreme Adverse Weather and Public Transport Difficulties"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,74,"In the event of extreme adverse weather conditions, e.g. heavy snow and flooding, or if your journey to work on public transport is affected by industrial action, engineering works etc, you are expected to make every reasonable effort (including the use of alternative means of transport) to arrive at work at your scheduled start time. If you decide that weather conditions or public transport difficulties are sufficiently severe to prevent you from travelling to work and arriving safely at work, you may ask your Line Manager to: a) Take the day(s) as annual leave. b) Take the day(s) as authorised unpaid leave of absence. c) Take the day off and make the time up. In any case, you must telephone your Line Manager before your scheduled start time and inform us of the situation.

In the event of a staff member losing a name badge or uniform then a replacement fee may be charged. 3.5 Office Presentation You must ensure that your work location is kept clean, tidy and presentable at all times and it is your responsibility to ensure standards are maintained. At Head Office we operate a “clear desk” policy and all items should be put away at the end of each day and not left on the desk, so that the cleaners can clean the workstation properly. 3.6 Conduct 3.6.1 Conduct at Work The Company has the right to expect its employees to adhere to acceptable standards of conduct"

Any employee caught under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or having any such items on Company premises, will be subject to the Company’s disciplinary procedure, which may include dismissal for gross misconduct. The Company reserves the right to ask an employee to submit to an independent medical examination (the cost of which will be borne by the Company) if we believe that there is a concern regarding alcohol or drug related problems. No employee shall, in connection with any work-related activity: • Attend work having consumed drugs or alcohol likely to render the employee unfit and/or unsafe for work."

When acting on behalf of the Company you are responsible for maintaining the Company’s reputation and for conducting business honestly and professionally. We also expect our business partners (including suppliers) and customers to operate in an ethical way.

Note: the above rules do not apply to staff that require such items as part of their normal duties. 3.13 Security The kind of work we do brings with it the need for the tightest possible security.

Allowing access to unauthorised persons on to customer sites (including family or friends) is a serious breach of security and health and safety, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. You are not allowed to access customer and Company storage facilities including desk drawers, cupboards, filing cabinets, etc unless this is required as part of your duties.

For example, a woman being treated less favourably than a male comparator. • Indirect discrimination is where a policy, decision, rule or act, although applied consistently to all, disadvantages a particular protected characteristic. For example, holding a compulsory training course in a venue with no disabled access. • Perceptive discrimination is where an individual is treated less favourably based on a perceived protected characteristic that may not be correct. The act of discrimination is still unlawful. • Associative discrimination is where an individual is treated less favourably than another because of their association with someone in a protected group, for example, because they care for a disabled relative. It is also the responsibility of all staff in their daily actions, decisions and behaviour to endeavour to promote these concepts, to comply with all relevant legislation and to ensure that they do not"

In adopting these principles, The Clean Space: 1) Will not tolerate acts that breach this policy and all such breaches or alleged breaches will be taken seriously, be fully investigated and may result in disciplinary action. 2) Fully recognises its legal obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and relevant codes of practice. 3) Will encourage employees to pursue any matter through the grievance procedure where they believe they have been exposed to inequitable treatment within the scope of this policy. 4) Will ensure that all managers understand and maintain their responsibilities and those of their team under this policy."

Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 49 3.22.1 Dignity at Work The Company is committed to creating a working environment free of harassment and bullying and where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. As an employee you are required to assist the Company to meet its commitment to provide equal opportunities in employment and to avoid unlawful discrimination. It should be noted that employees can be held personally liable as well as, or instead of, the Company, for any acts of unlawful discrimination or harassment. Acts of discrimination, harassment, bullying or victimisation against employees or customers are disciplinary offences and will be dealt with under the Company’s disciplinary procedure."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,125,"The Company believes that the working environment should at all times be supportive of the dignity and respect of individuals. If a complaint of direct, indirect or third-party harassment is brought to the attention of management, it will be investigated promptly, and appropriate action will be taken. Harassment is defined in the Equality Act 2010 as unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual. Indirect harassment is conduct that although not directed at an individual, has created a hostile environment which has had an adverse effect on them. Sexual harassment is defined as “unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, or other conduct based on sex, affecting the dignity of women and men at work”. This can include unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,126,"or non-verbal conduct. People can be subject to harassment on a wide variety of actual or perceived grounds including: • Race, ethnic origin, nationality or skin colour. • Sex, sexual orientation or gender reassignment. • Religious, philosophical or political beliefs. • Willingness to challenge harassment, leading to victimisation. • Disability, sensory impairments or learning difficulties or actions arising from these conditions (e.g. spelling mistakes caused by dyslexia). • Status as ex-offenders. • Age. • Real or suspected infection with a blood borne virus (e.g. AIDS/HIV). • Membership of a trade union or activities associated with membership. Forms of bullying and harassment may include: • Physical contact ranging from touching to serious assault. • Verbal and written harassment through jokes, offensive language, gossip and slander, sectarian songs, letters, cards and so on. This could be either in the workplace, or via email and social media sites."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,127,"and social media sites. • Visual display of posters, graffiti, obscene gestures, flags and emblems. • Isolation or non-cooperation at work, exclusion from social activities. • Coercion ranging from pressure for sexual favours to pressure to participate in political/religious groups. • Intrusion by pestering, spying, following someone. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 50 What should I do if I am subject to harassment? If you feel you are being directly or indirectly harassed, you are strongly encouraged to seek early advice/support from your line manager. If you feel your line manager is harassing you, then you should contact his/her immediate line manager or a director of the company. You should also keep a written record detailing the incidents of harassment and any requests made to the harasser to stop. This written record should be made as soon as possible after the events giving rise to concern and should include dates, times, places and the circumstances of what happened."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,128,"happened. Ultimately, if you are unable to resolve the issue informally, you should submit a written complaint to your line manager, or a more senior manager if the complaint is about your line manager, under the Grievance Procedure. 3.22.2 Religious Observance The Company will endeavour, on request, to alter an employee’s working pattern so that breaks can be granted at times to coincide with the employees needs for religious observance, insofar as this is possible and practicable, taking into account the needs of the business. Where an employee requests time off at a particularly busy time or at a time when the employees’ absence would otherwise cause difficulties for the business, or where the amount of time off requested is unreasonable or excessive, then the Company reserves the right to refuse to grant some or all of any time off requested. 3.23 Raising Concerns at Work (Whistleblowing)"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,129,"3.23 Raising Concerns at Work (Whistleblowing) It is important to the business that any fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing by employees or officers of the Company are reported and properly dealt with. The Company therefore encourages all individuals to raise any concerns that they may have about the conduct of others in the business, or the way in which the business is run. This Policy sets out the way in which individuals may raise any concerns that they have and how those concerns will be dealt with. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 provides protection for workers who raise legitimate concerns about specified matters. These are called 'qualifying disclosures'. A qualifying disclosure is one made in good faith by an employee who has a reasonable belief that the following has occurred: a criminal offence; a miscarriage of justice; an act creating risk to health and safety; an act causing damage to the environment; a breach of any other legal obligation; concealment of any of the above."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,130,"above. It is not necessary for the employee to have proof that such an act is being, has been, or is likely to be, committed - a reasonable belief is sufficient. It is the Company’s responsibility to ensure that an investigation takes place. An employee who makes such a protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed, or subjected to victimisation, because he or she has made the disclosure. If an employee is not sure whether to raise a concern, he or she should discuss the issue with their line manager. If the employee is concerned that his or her line manager is involved in the wrongdoing, has failed to make a proper investigation or to report the outcome of the investigations to the Board, he or she should inform a Director of the Company. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 51 3.23.1 Principles Everyone should be aware of the importance of preventing and eliminating wrongdoing at work. Employees should be watchful for illegal or unethical conduct and report anything of that nature"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,131,"that they become aware of: • Any matter raised under this procedure will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and confidentially, and the outcome of the investigation reported back to the employee who raised the issue. • No employee will be victimised for raising a matter under this procedure. • Victimisation of an employee for raising a qualified disclosure will be a disciplinary offence. • If misconduct is discovered as a result of any investigation under this procedure the Company's disciplinary procedure will be used, in addition to any appropriate external measures. • Maliciously making a false allegation is a disciplinary offence. • An instruction to cover up wrongdoing is itself a disciplinary offence. If told not to raise or pursue any concern, even by a person in authority such as a manager, employees should not agree to remain silent. They should report the matter to a Director. 3.24 Safeguarding Policy"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,132,"3.24 Safeguarding Policy The Clean Space recognises that our staff may have contact with children or vulnerable adults at particular customer establishments (e.g. schools, nurseries, etc) and therefore could observe the outward signs of child abuse. Therefore, the aim and objectives of this policy is for staff to understand their responsibilities in being alert to the signs of abuse and to clarify the reporting process to be followed to report such incidents to the customer. If you are worried that a child is being abused you should report this immediately to the designated person for child protection or their deputy at the school, nursery or similar establishment.

Incapability is where an employee cannot achieve a satisfactory level of performance even though"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,136,"they are giving their best efforts e.g. through poor health or not having the required skills or aptitude for their role. If an employee fails to reach the required standard of performance as a result of either doing or not doing specific things, which could include not following procedures or specific instructions, carelessness, negligence or a lack of effort, this will be treated as misconduct and will instigate the disciplinary procedure. Open and honest discussions about improving performance will take place, which may include the provision of on-going support in order to meet the required standards. Support will be tailored to the individuals needs and can include additional training, mentoring and coaching. After giving feedback about underperformance, the Line Manager will agree objectives and the actions required to improve performance, set a review period and monitor and give feedback on"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,137,"your progress. The objectives and progress against them will be recorded in writing and revisited at the review meetings. You will be expected to take responsibility for improving your performance to meet the required standard and to ask your Line Manager for help and support, if required. Normally we would expect underperformance to be addressed at this informal stage. However, if underperformance continues, performance does not improve over a reasonable amount of time, or if the problem is serious, then the matter will escalate to the formal stage of the performance management/disciplinary procedure. Prior to moving to the formal stage, a “letter of concern” may be issued setting out a final improvement plan and notifying the consequences of not reaching the required standard. 3.26.2 Formal Stage The Formal Stage of the performance management procedure forms part of the Company’s disciplinary procedure, details of which are contained in this Handbook and should be read in"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,138,"conjunction with the formal performance management procedure. At the formal stage the employee will receive a letter giving them at least 48 hours’ notice of a disciplinary hearing and offering the right to be accompanied at the hearing. Any warnings issued as a result of the hearing will normally remain on the employees file for a period of 12 months. 3.26.3 SMART Objectives Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 54 To assist staff, achieve the required standards, the Company uses a set of objectives known as SMART Objectives as shown below. By using SMART Objectives staff and Line Managers can put together specific written plans, so that staff know what objectives they are required to achieve, in a formal and planned way. 3.27 Disciplinary Procedure The Clean Space wishes to promote good employee relations and to ensure that at all times staff are treated in a fair and reasonable manner. These procedures are to ensure that all disciplinary matters"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,139,"are dealt with consistently throughout the Company and have been designed to assist and encourage improvements in employees conduct, attendance and performance whilst providing an impartial method of dealing with cases of alleged unacceptable behaviour. The procedures are compliant with the ACAS Code of Practice 2009. 3.27.1 The Principles • The procedure is designed to establish the facts quickly and to deal consistently with disciplinary/performance issues. No disciplinary action will be taken until the matter has been fully investigated. • Employees do not have the right to be accompanied at investigatory meetings, or at any meetings where informal counselling is given. • At every stage employees will be advised of the nature of the complaint. Where formal action is being considered, a letter will be sent to the employee detailing the alleged performance/conduct issue which will be discussed at the disciplinary hearing."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,140,"• If formal action is considered, then the employee will be given the opportunity to state his/her case and be represented/accompanied by a fellow employee of their choice, or by a certified trade union official. • There is no duty on any employee to accept a request to accompany a fellow employee and it would not normally be reasonable for an employee to insist on being accompanied by a representative/companion whose presence may prejudice the case. • Employees will not be dismissed for a first breach of discipline except in the case of gross misconduct, when the penalty will normally be dismissal without notice and without pay in lieu of notice. • Employees have a right to appeal against any formal disciplinary action taken. • The procedure may be implemented at any stage if the alleged misconduct or underperformance warrants such action. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 55 3.27.2 The Procedure In order to ensure that you are treated fairly if your conduct or performance does not meet the"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,141,"standards required, the Company will adopt the following procedure: Informal Procedure If an employee fails to meet the standards required by the Company, their Line Manager will give them informal counselling or coaching. The line manager will document in writing, what improvements are necessary, the timescale for the improvement and any additional advice or support that is to be provided to the employee (e.g. training, coaching, etc). The employee has no right to be accompanied where informal counselling or coaching is given. A “letter of concern” may be issued prior to commencing formal action, setting out a final improvement plan and notifying the employee of the consequences of failing to meet the required standards during the improvement plan. First Written Warning If the employee’s conduct or performance fails to improve during the final informal improvement plan, they will be asked to attend a disciplinary hearing at which they may be accompanied."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,142,"Normally, if the allegations of misconduct or underperformance are upheld, normally the outcome of the hearing is a First Written Warning. The warning will be kept on the employees’ record for 12 months and disregarded for disciplinary purposes after that period. The employee will be informed that failure to improve their performance or conduct, may result in further disciplinary action being taken. The warning will be confirmed in writing with the right of appeal. Final Written Warning If the employee has a current warning about conduct or performance, then further misconduct or unsatisfactory performance may warrant a Final Written Warning. This may also be the case where ‘first offence’ misconduct is sufficiently serious but would not justify dismissal. Again, the employee may be accompanied at the disciplinary hearing. The warning will be kept on the employees’ record for 12 months and disregarded for disciplinary purposes after that period. The employee will be"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,143,"informed that failure to improve their performance or conduct, may result in dismissal. The warning will be confirmed in writing with the right of appeal. Dismissal If despite previous warnings, the employee’s conduct or performance does not improve, the employee will attend a disciplinary hearing at which they may be accompanied, the outcome of which may be Dismissal with notice. The dismissal and its reasons will be confirmed in writing with the right of appeal. As an alternative to dismissal, the Company reserves the right to demote an employee as a disciplinary sanction and to reduce the employees pay. Written notice of the demotion detailing the changes will be given to the employee. Misconduct The Company expects its employees to adhere to acceptable standards of conduct and to deal with customers and colleagues in a cooperative and respectful way. Although not exhaustive, the following are examples of misconduct which could result in disciplinary action being taken:"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,144,"• Persistent lateness or poor time keeping. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 56 • Absence from work, including going absent during work, without valid reason, notification or authorisation. • Failure to follow the Company’s absence reporting procedures, including failure to inform the Line Manager of absence and/or failure to provide Self-Certificates/GP Fit Notes in accordance with the Company’s sick leave procedures. • Breach of Health and Safety law, rules, policy or procedures. • Negligence or inadequate standards of work. • Failure to follow reasonable instructions. • Unreasonable standards of dress or personal hygiene. • Abuse of Facilities. • Failure to observe or work to Company policies, procedures and regulations. • Discrimination, Bullying, Harassment or Victimisation. • Insubordination by word, act or demeanour. The Company considers all the above examples as similar or “linked” acts of misconduct and they"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,145,"will therefore be dealt with via the same disciplinary route (i.e. if an employee receives a first written warning for any of the above and then commits another act of misconduct then a final written warning may be issued). Gross Misconduct If, after investigation, it is deemed that an employee has committed a very serious offence of the following nature (the list is not exhaustive), the normal consequence will be summary dismissal (i.e. dismissal will be immediate and without recourse to the normal warning steps and without notice): • Theft, including unauthorised possession of Company property. • Breaches of confidentiality, prejudicial to the interest of the Company. • Being unfit for duty because of the misuse/consumption of drugs or alcohol. • Breach of confidentiality/security procedures. • Physical assault or verbal abuse inside or outside of the workplace. • Serious bullying or harassment. • Serious act of insubordination; e.g. which creates a danger or hazard, or which brings the"

The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,147,"• Unauthorised access to computer records and/or sensitive Company information. • Bringing the Company into serious disrepute which includes the inappropriate use of social media, serious criminal charge, criminal conviction. • A serious breach of confidence or dereliction of duty. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 57 3.27.3 Suspension Where there is an allegation of gross misconduct or gross negligence, the Company reserves the right to suspend the employee from duty, as a precautionary measure. Suspension will be instigated where it is considered a risk to either the investigation, the Company or colleagues to allow the employee to remain at work during an investigation. Suspension will not be implemented as a matter of course, but only where the risk is considered too great. During the period of suspension, the employee will receive full pay and benefits. Suspension is not disciplinary action, will be for as short a time as possible and does not infer guilt. 3.27.4 Durations of Warning"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,148,"3.27.4 Durations of Warning The Company reserves the right to increase the time that formal warnings will remain on file, where it deems it appropriate. 3.27.5 The Right of Appeal Where an employee feels that disciplinary action taken against them is wrong or unjust, they have the right to appeal the decision. The appeal should be sent in writing to the person named in the disciplinary outcome letter stating the full grounds for the appeal, within five working days of receipt of the letter. The Appeal Hearing Where, possible, a manager of at least equal seniority to the disciplinary chairperson or a Director, who was not involved in the original disciplinary decision will hear the appeal. At the appeal hearing the employee will have the right to be accompanied by a work colleague or certified trade union representative. It may be necessary to carry out further investigation before deciding on the appeal, for example where new evidence is presented. The findings, decision and"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,149,"outcome of the appeal hearing, will be confirmed to the employee in writing. It should be noted that the appeal chairperson’s decision is final and there is no further right of appeal. 3.28 Grievance Procedure The grievance procedure is in accordance with the ACAS Code of Practice 2009 and provides each employee with the opportunity to raise a complaint against the Company or a fellow employee and have it formally investigated and responded to. Note: Where an employee raises a grievance during the formal disciplinary process the disciplinary process may be suspended in order to deal with the grievance. Where the grievance and disciplinary cases are related it may be appropriate to deal with both issues concurrently. 3.28.1 Informal Discussions If you are unhappy about the treatment that you have received or about any aspect of your work, you should first discuss this with your Line Manager, who will attempt to resolve the situation on an"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,150,"informal basis. The Line Manager will discuss your concerns in confidence, make discreet investigations, and attempt to resolve the matter speedily and fairly. Most grievances are likely to be resolved satisfactorily at this stage. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 58 3.28.2 Formal Procedure Stage 1 - Statement of Grievance If an employee is unable to resolve an issue informally, they should raise it in writing under the formal grievance procedure. The grievance should be addressed to their line manager or if the grievance is about the line manager to their line manager’s manager.. If an employee wishes a verbal grievance to be treated under the formal procedure, they should make this clear to their line manager, who will document the issue as a formal record of the grievance having been raised. Note: Further attempts may be made to resolve the matter informally, depending on the nature of the complaint. However, if you are not satisfied with the outcome, you may insist on the matter"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,151,"proceeding to a full grievance hearing. Stage 2 - Grievance Hearing The employee will be invited to a grievance hearing, with the right to be accompanied by a workplace colleague or a certified trade union representative. The Company may carry out some preliminary investigation prior to the hearing, however the main purpose of the hearing is for the employee to fully explain their grievance. The manager hearing the grievance will ask questions for clarity. The employee may call witnesses to the hearing. The hearing may be adjourned at any time for further investigation to take place. If you fail to attend the hearing without explanation, or if it appears that you have not made sufficient attempts to attend, the company will respond to your grievance in writing without a hearing. Following the hearing the Company will provide a written response to the grievance offering the right of appeal. Stage 3 - Appeal Every employee has the right to appeal against the outcome of a grievance."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,152,"Any appeal should be put in writing within 5 working days, to the manager designated in the grievance response letter and should state the full grounds for the appeal. An appeal hearing will normally be arranged within 10 working days of the appeal letter. The appeal hearing will normally be chaired by a senior manager who was not involved in the grievance. The outcome of the appeal hearing will be confirmed in writing. There is no further right of appeal and the decision at this stage is final. Note: The provisions detailed within the Company’s grievance procedure comply with the ACAS Code of Practice 2009, however they do not from part of employee’s contract of employment and are not contractually binding. 3.28.3 Mediation Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 59 In the event of a dispute, disagreement or complaint against another employee, the parties may be offered and agree to attempt to settle the matter by mediation. Mediation must be entered into"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,153,"both voluntarily and with a demonstrable desire to resolve the situation amicably. Neither party will, by entering into such a process, waive their respective statutory or contractual employment rights. Mediation involves the appointment of a third-party mediator, who will initially discuss the issues raised individually with the parties, with the aim to follow this up with a joint meeting to agree an action plan. 3.29 Harassment/Bullying If you are treated in a manner that you believe constitutes harassment or bullying, you have the right to make a complaint against the individual(s) concerned. Harassment is defined in the Equality Act 2010 as unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual. There is no legal definition of bullying, but it is defined by the Company as offensive, intimidating,"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,154,"malicious or insulting behaviour, and/or an abuse or misuse of power that has the effect of undermining, humiliating or injuring the recipient. Bullying can also include work based and social exclusion. Both definitions can include things such as inappropriate humour, unwanted physical contact, coercion, repeated criticism and pressure to achieve unreasonable expectations of performance. If you raise a complaint in good faith under this policy, you will under no circumstances be subjected to any unfavourable treatment or victimisation as a result of making the complaint. However, if it is established that you have made a deliberately false or malicious complaint against another individual(s) about harassment or bullying, disciplinary action may be taken against you, which could include dismissal. Any employee who witnesses an incident that he/she believes to be the harassment or bullying of another member of staff, must report the incident in confidence either to his/her Line Manager or"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,155,"where this is not appropriate to a more senior manager or Director. The Company will take all such reports seriously and will treat the information in strict confidence as far as it is possible to do so. However, you may be asked to make a witness statement. The allegation will be thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action taken. 3.29.1 How to Make a Complaint Before raising a formal complaint, you are encouraged in the first instance to talk directly and informally to the individual(s) whom you believe is harassing you and explain clearly what aspect of the individual(s) behaviour is unacceptable, or is causing offence, and request that it stop. It may be that the individual(s) whose conduct is causing offence is genuinely unaware that his/her behaviour is unwelcome or objectionable and therefore a direct approach can resolve the matter without the need for formal action. Where you would like support to make such an approach, you should contact"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,156,"your Line Manager or if the allegation is about your line manager, a more senior manager or Director. If, however, you feel unable to take this course of action, or if you have already approached the individual(s) to no avail, or if the harassment is of a very serious nature, you may elect to raise a Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 60 formal complaint using the Company’s Grievance procedure. Formal complaints may be raised with either your Line Manager or, if preferred, a more senior manager or Director. In bringing a complaint of harassment/bullying, you should be prepared to state: • The name of the person(s) whose behaviour you believe amounts to harassment or bullying. • The type of behaviour that is causing offence, or that you have witnessed, together with specific examples if possible. • Dates and times when incidents of harassment or bullying occurred, and where they occurred. • The names of any other person(s) who witnessed any incidents, or who themselves may"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,157,"have been the victims of harassment or bullying by the same person(s). • Any action that you have already taken to try to deal with the harassment. The Company reserves the right, at its discretion, to suspend any employee who is under investigation for harassment or bullying for a temporary period whilst investigations are being carried out. Suspension will only be implemented where there is a genuine belief that the individual causes a risk to the investigation, the company or colleagues if they are allowed to remain at work. Any suspension will be for as short a time as possible and will be on full pay. As part of the investigation, an employee accused of harassment or bullying will be informed of the exact nature of the complaint against him/her and afforded a full opportunity to challenge the allegations and put forward an explanation for his/her behaviour in a confidential interview., No employee will be presumed guilty following an allegation of harassment or bullying against him/her."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,158,"The Company regards all forms of harassment and bullying as serious misconduct, and any employee who is found to have harassed or bullied a colleague will be liable to disciplinary action up to and including summary dismissal.

These records will be maintained in confidence and in line with the provisions of General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

All accidents or injuries must be reported to Human Resources who will record this in the Company’s Accident Book. 6.2.3 Reducing Risks In order to reduce the risk of an accident or injury here are a few points to remember: 1) Never use defective equipment and report these immediately to your Line Manager. 2) Do not block fire exits routes/doors. 3) Ensure walk ways are clear and clean up any spillages. 4) Use appropriate signage when cleaning floors, etc. 5) Do not attempt to reach items beyond your grasp use a stepping stool. Only trained staff may use ladders. 6) Ensure you use the correct posture when lifting items by keeping back straight and bending knees. 7) Follow COSHH regulations for handing cleaning substances and use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when required. 8) Ensure that all cleaning materials are stored and disposed of properly."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,172,"9) Ensure that you wash your hands regularly, wash your hands after handling waste or when cleaning toilets and protect cuts and grazes properly. 10) Do not mix chemicals under any circumstances. 11) Do not leave the vacuuming cleaner or similar cleaning equipment unattended as they can cause a trip hazard. 12) Trailing electrical flex can pose a trip hazard so ensure these are routed where they cause the least obstruction and ensure that warning signs are in place. 13) Do not attempt to lift heavy objects. Seek help or use appropriate lifting equipment. 14) Make sure you have read and understood the Company’s Health and Safety Policy. Please note that the above list is not exhaustive, and you should refer to specific health and safety procedures for your work location or role. Note: Protective clothing and equipment (PPE), e.g. footwear, rubber gloves and items of protective equipment may be issued to you for protection because of the nature of your job. Failure to use the"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,173,"issued safety clothing and equipment will be regarded as a contravention of the Health and Safety rules and may lead to disciplinary action. It is your responsibility to look after these items and to report damaged or faulty clothing and equipment and to state when replacement is required. 6.2.4 Security Premises Ensure that all doors and windows are locked and the building secure and alarmed if this is your responsibility. It is vital to ensure that all keys, alarm fobs and passes or any access or security devices are kept safe. Suspicious Packages In case of a security threat (e.g. bomb scare, robbery, etc) staff must look after their personal security as a priority and take appropriate action to ensure their safety. If you discover any Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 67 suspicious packages in or near the premises do not touch them. When at a place of safety, staff must contact the Police (999) and the Line Manager as soon as possible regarding the incident."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,174,"CCTV and Audio Recording The Company has the right to use CCTV and audio recording surveillance systems for the protection, benefit and safety of staff and for the detection and the prevention of crime. The Company also reserves the right to use CCTV and audio recording systems for the monitoring of work practices, quality assurance, performance and absence management, training and development and for the identification of acts of misconduct. If staff are found not to be in compliance with Company procedures, are found to be responsible for any act of misconduct, or if staff fail to meet the required standards, then CCTV and audio recording may be used for training and development purposes, for performance management, or be used as admissible evidence as part of the Company’s disciplinary procedure. 6.2.5 Emergency Situations In Emergency Situations staff should follow the emergency procedures that are contained in this"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,175,"Handbook and in Work Procedures/Manuals. As a general rule, if you find yourself in an emergency situation, your common sense, your instincts and your training, will help you to decide what to do. However, the basic advice is to: • Make sure you do not put yourself or others at risk. • Make sure 999 has been called if people are injured or if there is a threat to life. • Follow the advice of the emergency services. • Try to remain calm and think before acting and try to reassure others. • Check for injuries – remember to help yourself before attempting to help others. • Go to a place of safety and stay there until it is safe, or until you have been advised otherwise. • Contact your Line Manager. 6.2.6 Smoking Smoking in the workplace is illegal and the Company also has a duty of care to ensure, as far as practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all its employees. Therefore, smoking is strictly forbidden at all Company and Customer premises, including at building entrances."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,176,"Staff are not entitled to take smoking breaks and may only smoke during designated breaks well away from company and customer premises and the entrances. As the Company recognises that smoking is detrimental to the health and wellbeing of its staff, it encourages all staff to stop smoking. There is an online resource offered by the NHS for advice on giving up smoking, which can be found at http://www.nhs.uk/smokefree. 6.2.7 Staff Welbeing Although the Company does not wish to intrude on employee’s lifestyles, it recognises that employees can take practical steps to improve their health. The NHS has highlighted the problems of Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 68 obesity, heart disease and poor diet and have produced the following recommendations to improve people’s health: • Take regular exercise – keep active and watch your weight. • Eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day, cut down on fatty foods and snacks and drink more water."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,177,"snacks and drink more water. • Try and reduce the amount of salt in your diet, as this causes high blood pressure. • Limit the consumption of alcohol. • Get your eyes tested, visit your dentist and get your blood pressure and cholesterol level checked by your GP, if overdue. 6.2.8 Stress Management/Mental Wellbeing The Company will proactively manage and support the mental wellbeing of our staff to enable them to achieve their full potential and deliver the best outcome for the business. Any of us may feel stressed at some time or another, whether for work or personal reasons or a combination of both. The degree to which we feel stressed and the point that this becomes a negative experience will vary from person to person and from situation to situation. Stress and mental health issues are nothing to be embarrassed about and the Company advises that anyone feeling stressed at work, is under excessive pressure or is suffering a mental health issue"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,178,"should speak to their Line Manager in confidence, in the first instance. If you feel unable to consult your Line Manager, you should talk to another manager or Director. The Company can offer a number of ways to help support staff including counselling and advice, or if necessary, refer staff to a relevant voluntary and/or professional service. 6.2.9 Driving on Company Business Certain jobs within the Company require the jobholder to drive using their own vehicle, hire vehicle, or a vehicle provided by the Company. In these circumstances it is the employee’s responsibility to hold a current and valid driving licence. If an employee who is required to drive to carry out their duties, is no longer allowed to drive, for any reason, the Company will consult with the employee on possible redeployment to another role that does not require the employee to drive. However, if there are no redeployment opportunities, the Company may have no alternative but to terminate employment."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,179,"It is also a condition of employment that any driving offence or endorsement on the driving licence must be reported to the Line Manager, within one week of its occurrence. For employees that use their own vehicle for Company business (whether on a one-off, voluntary, temporary or permanent basis), it is the employee’s responsibility to ensure that the vehicle is safe and roadworthy, comprehensive insurance cover for business us is arranged and the vehicle has a valid MOT certificate. The Company is not liable for any costs incurred in the event of any accident, breakdown, motoring fines, loss of earnings, or any other costs that are incurred by the employee (except mileage claims), whilst driving on Company business. Employee Handbook v.4.8 P a g e | 69 At all times when driving on Company business employees must: • Be responsible for their own and passenger’s safety by ensuring that seatbelts are worn on all journeys."
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,180,"all journeys. • Ensure that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition and is safe to use. • To be extra careful when driving in adverse travel conditions. • Take appropriate breaks when travelling long distances. • To keep within designated speed limits. • No employee should drive if their ability is impaired (including driving when under the influence of alcohol or drugs). It is the responsibility of the employee to inform their Line Manager if they are suffering from any illness or medical condition, which might impair their ability to drive safely. • Not use a hand-held mobile telephone whilst driving or where the car is stationary with the engine switched on. 6.2.10 VDU’s and Computer Keyboards The following provides guidance on good working practices when working with computers: • If you are operating a VDU continuously take regular breaks. • If you have problems working with screens or keyboards, such as eye irritation or muscle"
The_Clean_Space.pdf,The Clean Space,181,"strain, or if you experience any numbness or stiffening in wrists, arms, fingers, neck or shoulders then speak to your Line Manager. If you are still concerned, then you should consult your doctor or your optician. To avoid such problems, you should ensure: • That you are sitting comfortably at your workstation, adjust your chair if necessary. • Do not rest your wrists on the edge of the keyboard or desk. • Do not bend your hands up at the wrist when using the keyboard. • Ensure the screen is below eye level and that bright lights are not reflected on it. • You have an eye test at least every two years, as recommended by the NHS.

No provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical Practice’s President, or designee. At-Will Employment Statement Employment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an employee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it intended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will"
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,8,"employment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written contract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual. Neither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual right, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for any specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by Crouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are disciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to terminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps. 2 | P a g e No supervisor or other representative of Crouse Medical Practice except the Owner and/or President has the authority to enter into any contract of employment for any specified period of"

While it is our goal to provide employees with notice of such changes, prior notice is not required before a change is implemented. Throughout an employee’s employment with Crouse Medical Practice, it is his or her responsibility to remain up to date on company policies, procedures, benefits and work conditions—both published and unpublished.

Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and those we serve – regardless of background or position – so that each person can be successful in his or her work. Diversity is...all of the ways we are different as individual people – the characteristics of who we are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences. Our culture and values support diversity and inclusion by:  Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team  Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s and our community  Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and perspectives Employment Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or"
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,12,"more employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform the essential job functions of the position. Crouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of individuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. When a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided without creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given"
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,13,"the same consideration for employment as any other applicant. Crouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and employees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the requested accommodations result in the following:  A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or  An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice. Individuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company ADA policy. 5 | P a g e The Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including the resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues. Contact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation. Employee Classification Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as"
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,14,"determined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:  Exempt - Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including managerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees. Exempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or part-time status.  Non-Exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards. Overtime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these employees. Non-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full- time or part-time status. Employment Resignation and Termination Termination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons"
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,15,"for termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your anticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, non- exempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and exempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice (unless otherwise specified within an employment contract). Upon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with an accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year. In the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work force, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off (PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be specifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please refer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014."
Crouse.pdf,Crouse,16,"refer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014. If you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will assume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline Policy #600-002. 6 | P a g e Employment Status FULL-TIME - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such full-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service have been met. PART-TIME - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be part- time and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who work on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other employee benefits. PER DIEM – Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of"
