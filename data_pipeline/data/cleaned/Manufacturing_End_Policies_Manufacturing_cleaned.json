THIS MEANS YOUR**\n**EMPLOYMENT MAY BE TERMINATED WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE AT ANY TIME BY**\n**EITHER YOU OR E.N.D JEWELRY. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS HANDBOOK OR**\n**STATEMENTS BY ANY PERSON WILL ALTER THIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.

E.N.D JEWELRY RESERVES THE**\n**RIGHT AND HAS THE SOLE DISCRETION TO CHANGE, ALTER, SUPPLEMENT OR AMEND ANY**\n**OF THESE RULES, REGULATIONS OR POLICIES IN THIS HANDBOOK AT ANY TIME**\n**WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE.**\n\n---\n\n**ATTENDANCE, PUNCTUALITY AND TIME RECORDS**\nAll employees are expected to be at work at the time scheduled for their attendance and be at their work stations at\nthe scheduled time for work to begin. When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to\ntelephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may\nbe absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin\nwhen they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee’s time\nsheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance\napproval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to\ndiscipline.\n\nUpon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the\nreason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor’s certificate, to substantiate the\nabsence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or\nwritten reprimand, or termination of employment.\n\nAbsence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early\ndepartures as well as absence for an entire day.\n\nAn employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to\nhave voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY.\n\nEmployees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records.\nEmployees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log\nout for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business\npurposes as part of their job duties. Tampering with another employee’s time records, including logging another\nemployee in or out, is prohibited and may result in immediate termination.\n\n**BULLETIN BOARDS**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY uses bulletin boards to communicate important business information such as safety\nrules, statutory and legal notices, company policies, and management memos. Each employee has the responsibility\nto read the information that is posted. Employees may not post material on bulletin boards without the approval of\nthe Manager.\n\n**CONFIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRET**\n\nIt shall be the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to develop procedures for the control, protection and\ndisclosure of all confidential and business information and trade secrets (collectively referred to as confidential\ninformation). All current and former employees of E.N.D JEWELRY are prohibited from disclosing or using\nconfidential information for any purpose including competing with E.N.D JEWELRY, both during their\nemployment, and after their employment relationship at E.N.D JEWELRY has ceased.\n\nConfidential information includes, but is not limited to, all financial books, records, instruments and\ndocuments; purchase orders; purchase information and inventory; client lists; software programs and codes; reports;\npending proposals; marketing strategies and research; technological data; and any other instruments, records or\ndocuments relating to or pertaining to E.N.D JEWELRY, which was received, reviewed, developed or became\nknown to the employee during their employment at E.N.D JEWELRY.\n\n---\n\nThe failure to comply with this policy by an employee may result in immediate termination and legal action\nto prevent the disclosure or use of the confidential information. Access to confidential information is restricted\nand any employee attempting to access such information for which he or she is not authorized, may be subject to\ndisciplinary action up to and including immediate termination.\n\n**DISTRIBUTION OF HANDBILLS, SOLICITATIONS, AND COLLECTIONS**\n\nUnauthorized distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections on the premises by nonemployees is prohibited at all times. Employees are required to report conditions that appear to violate this policy as\nsoon as possible violations are observed.\n\nThe distribution of handbills, solicitations, and collections by employees to other employees are subject to\nthe prior approval of the General Manager. Approved distributions, solicitations, and collections may occur only on\nan employee's own time, may involve only those employees who are also on their own time, and may occur only in\nspecified areas.\n\nThe solicitation and collection of money for special occasions (such as wedding or new baby)\nexperienced by employees are appropriate and will generally be approved by the General Manager.\n\n**DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE**\n\nTo help ensure a safe, healthy and productive drug free work environment for the employees of E.N.D\nJEWELRY, to protect its property and assets, and to assure efficient operations, E.N.D JEWELRY has adopted a\nPolicy on drugs and alcohol.\n\nIt is E.N.D JEWELRY'S policy to maintain and provide a drug and alcohol-free working environment that\nis both safe for our employees and customers and conducive to efficient and productive work standards. This policy\nrestricts certain items and substances from being brought on to or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property,\nincluding its parking areas and its vehicles and prohibits E.N.D JEWELRY employees and all others from reporting\nto work, working or being present on E.N.D JEWELRY property, *whether or not on duty* , from being under the\ninfluence of drugs or other substances. Employees should consult and are required to comply with the Drug and\nAlcohol Free Workplace and Testing Policy.\n\n**EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION**\n\nAt the time you are hired, you are classified as full-time, part-time or temporary. You are also told whether you\nqualify for overtime pay (non-exempt). Unless otherwise specified, the benefits described in this handbook apply only to\nfull-time employees. However, all rules, regulations and policies described in this handbook apply to all employees. Parttime employees are employees who generally work less than a forty (40) hour week. Temporary employees are employees\nwho are hired for a specific project or purpose scheduled to last less than six (6) months. If you are a part-time or temporary\nemployee, you are not eligible for benefits described in this handbook except to the extent required by state and federal laws.\n\n**EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE COMPANY**\n\n---\n\nnotification shall include a brief description of the work performed and the approximate number of hours per week devoted\nto it. Nothing in this requirement shall be construed to prohibit such employment, unless it interferes with the\nemployee’s performance of his or her job duties and responsibilities, including scheduling demands, with E.N.D\nJEWELRY, or if the nature of the outside employment is deemed to have a negative impact on E.N.D JEWELRY or\ncreates a conflict of interest.\n\nIf E.N.D JEWELRY determines that an employee’s outside employment interferes with performance or the\nability to meet the requirements of E.N.D JEWELRY, as may be modified from time to time, or the outside\nemployment is deemed to have a negative impact or creates a conflict of interest, the employee may be asked to\nterminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain employed at E.N.D JEWELRY.\n\n**EQUAL EMPLOYMENT**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Equal employment opportunity is not only good\nbusiness, it’s the law and applies to all areas of employment, including recruitment, selection, hiring,\ntraining, transfer, promotion, termination, compensation, and benefits.\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY will recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels the most qualified applicants\nwithout regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or veteran status, disability or any other condition\nprotected by state or federal law. Furthermore, E.N.D JEWELRY will make reasonable accommodations for\nqualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship.\n\n**ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS**\n\nEmployees are expected to use good judgment, adhere to high ethical standards and avoid situations that\ncreate an actual or perceived conflict between their personal interests and those of E.N.D JEWELRY\nrequires that the transactions employees participate in are ethical and within the law, both in letter and in spirit.\nEmployees are expected to not engaged in, directly or indirectly on or off the job, any conduct which is disruptive,\ncompetitive, or damaging to E.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that different organizations have different codes of ethics.\nHowever, just because a certain action may be acceptable by others outside of E.N.D JEWELRY as “standard\npractice,” that is by no means sufficient reason to assume that such practice is acceptable at E.N.D JEWELRY.\nThere is no way to develop a comprehensive, detailed set of rules to cover every business situation, therefore this\npolicy is intended to outline some basic guidelines to be followed. Whenever employees are in doubt, they should\nconsult with their manager.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL PAY AND RIGHT OF OFFSET**\n\nIf you resign or are terminated, your final pay, whether by check or direct deposit will be available to you\non the next regularly scheduled payday (unless other arrangements have been made). All Company property must\nbe returned to your Supervisor or the General Manager at the time your final check is released to you. To the extent\nallowed by law, (i) any amounts owing, including for tool purchases, to the Company or the monetary value of\nany unreturned Company property, including Company tools and uniforms will be deducted from the\nemployee's final paycheck; and (ii) any employee who has engaged in misconduct (i.e. intentional or deliberate\nconduct that causes injury, damage or loss to the Company) will have offset from any final check and/or payment of\naccrued but unused vacation, the monetary amount of any injury, damage or loss as determined by the Company.\nTo the extent the final paycheck is not enough to satisfy the amounts owed to the Company by you, you agree to\nimmediately pay such amount or forfeit all tools equal in value to the amount owed to the Company.\n\n**FIRE, DISASTER AND OTHER EMERGENCIES**\n\nThe importance of fire and other calamities' prevention cannot be too strongly emphasized. Your\nSupervisor or the General Manager will inform you of your duties in the event of a fire or other emergency. You\nshould immediately report any fire hazard to your Supervisor or the General Manager. In case of emergencies,\nyour Supervisor or the General Manager will give correct procedures to be followed as to safe evacuation, or areas\nappropriate for safety of Employees, members and guests.\n\n**HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY is committed to maintaining a work environment that is free from intimidation and\nharassment, that fosters mutual employee respect and promotes harmonious productive working relationships.\nEvery employee of E.N.D JEWELRY is responsible for assuring that the work place is free from all forms of\nharassment and discrimination. E.N.D JEWELRY prohibits and will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of\nany employee due to age, race, sex, religion, color, national origin, disability, or on any other basis that would be in\nviolation of any applicable federal, state, or local law.\n\n***Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of verbal, visual or physical conduct that belittles, demeans\nor shows hostility or aversion toward an individual for reasons including, but not limited to his/her gender, race,\nreligion, color, national origin, age, sexual preference or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates,\nand that:  has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment;\n has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or\n otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.\n***Sexual Harassment*** , as defined for this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual comments, advances, request for\n\nsexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\n submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\nemployment;\n submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions\naffecting such individual; or\n such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work\nenvironment.\n\nProhibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or\ncontact to physical contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is offensive or harassing to others.\nExamples of conduct which could be considered sexual harassment include:\n\n---\n\n sexually suggestive jokes or gestures directed toward another or sexually oriented or degrading\ncomments about another;\n preferential treatment of an employee or a promise of preferential treatment to an employee in exchange\nfor dates or sexual conduct, or the denial or threat of denial of employment benefits or advancements for\nrefusal to consent to sexual advances;\n the open display of sexually oriented pictures, posters, or other material offensive to others; and\n retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct.\n\nAll employees are encouraged to express displeasure at any conduct which might be sexually harassing, to\ntell the individual engaging in the conduct that it is unwelcome, and to report the conduct as described in this policy.\n\nOccasionally, talking with a supervisor or another employee about the harassment is not sufficient for\nreporting a complaint of harassment. If you feel you are being harassed, you should immediately inform the person\nharassing you that his or her behavior is unwelcome and must stop. You should always promptly report the matter\nto the General Manager. Although, delayed reporting of a complaint could hinder the Company’s ability to\neffectively investigate the complaint, it will not in and of itself preclude the Company from investigating the matter\nand taking appropriate action.\n\nIf the person you feel is harassing you is General Manager, you should contact the Chief Executive\nOfficer of E.N.D JEWELRY, immediately.\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY has no requirement for the form or content of a harassment complaint. Although the\ncomplaint may be verbal, a written statement may be required as part of the investigation to be conducted by E.N.D\nJEWELRY. Allegations of harassment and discrimination are taken very seriously. You have a duty to fully\ncomply with the investigation. You should provide as much information as possible regarding the\noffending incident or conduct, including what happened or is continuing to happen, the person or persons\ncausing the harassment, and the time(s) and place(s) that the incident(s) or conduct occurred. If available,\nthe names of witnesses should be provided, but you should not hesitate to report harassment merely because\nwitnesses are not available or cannot be identified.\n\nAll complaints will be investigated promptly. The complaint will be investigated in as confidential of a\nmanner as possible, but confidentiality cannot be promised. If an investigation confirms that harassment in violation\nof this policy has occurred, E.N.D JEWELRY will take appropriate corrective action as determined by it in its sole\ndiscretion. The corrective action may include discipline up to and including termination. The extent and type of\ncorrective action taken may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of the particular\nemployee and the nature of the offense. There will be no retaliation by E.N.D JEWELRY against any employee\nwho makes a good-faith report, even if, after investigation, it appears that there has been no violation. However,\nfalse reports are another form of harassment and should not be made.\n\nIf either party directly involved in a harassment or discrimination investigation is dissatisfied with\nthe outcome or resolution, that individual has the right to appeal the decision by submitting his or her written\ncomments in a timely manner to the General Manager of E.N.D JEWELRY\n\n**HOLIDAYS**\n\nIt Is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to designate and observe certain days each year as holidays. As listed below will\n\n---\n\nNew Year’s Day\nMemorial Day\nIndependence Day (July 4th)\nLabor Day\nThanksgiving Day\nDay after Thanksgiving Day\nChristmas Eve\nChristmas Day\nNew Year’s Eve\nOne floating holiday as determined by the Company\n\nTemporary employees, part-time employees, and employees on leaves of absence or on lay-off are not eligible to\nreceive holiday pay. Full-time employees, for both day and night shifts, are eligible to receive their regular hourly rate of\npay for eight (8) hours (no overtime wages will be paid) for each observed holiday.\n\nTo receive holiday pay, an eligible employee must be at work, or on an authorized absence, on the work days\nimmediately preceding and immediately following the day on which the holiday is observed. If an employee is absent on\none or both of these days because of an illness or injury, the Company reserves the right to verify the reason for the absence\nbefore approving holiday pay.\n\nA holiday that occurs on a Saturday or Sunday may be observed on either the preceding Friday or\nfollowing Monday as determined by E.N.D JEWELRY.\n\nIf a holiday occurs during an employee’s vacation period, the employee will be given an additional day of paid\nvacation, which may be taken at the beginning or end of the employee’s vacation period, subject to the prior approval of the\nemployee’s supervisor.\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY recognizes that some employees may wish to observe, as periods of worship or\ncommemoration, certain days which are not included in E.N.D JEWELRY'S holiday schedule. Employees who\nwould like to take a day off for such reasons may be permitted to do so if the employee’s absence from work will\nnot result is an undue hardship in the operation of E.N.D JEWELRY'S business and if prior approval has been\nobtained from the employee’s supervisor. Employees may use their paid vacation on such occasions, or they may\ntake such time off as an unpaid, excused absence.\n\n---\n\n**INJURY OR ILLNESS ON THE JOB**\n\nAny employee reporting an on-the-job injury or illness will receive immediate and appropriate medical treatment.\nAll applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations pertaining to occupational injuries or illnesses will be followed and\ncomplied with at all times.\n\nIt is the responsibility of all employees to report immediately to their supervisor all on-the-job injuries or illnesses\nregardless of how insignificant or minor the injury or illness may appear at the time.\n\nWhen employees sustain an injury or illness that requires outside medical treatment, the employees may\nalso be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law\npermits these tests. When employees are involved in a accident that results in significant property damage, the\nemployees may be subject to completing a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system,\nprovided state law permits these tests. Any employee who refuses screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol\nwill be subject to immediate termination.\n\n**MAINTENANCE OF WORK AREAS**\n\nIt is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY that work areas are to be kept clean and orderly\n\nAll employees are responsible for maintaining there work areas in a clean and orderly fashion at all times. To\nfulfill this responsibility, each employee should, at a minimum, do the following:\n\n Prior to the end of the work day, clean and organize all tools and equipment and properly secure any\nitems, papers, or information of value; and\n Place coats, boots, umbrellas, and other items of clothing in designated areas so that work stations are not\nunnecessarily cluttered.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for making sure that their employees maintain their work areas in accordance with the\nrequirements of this policy. Each supervisor should:\n\n Make sure that aisles, floors, and walls are free of debris and other unnecessary items and that all end-ofthe-shift tasks have been performed;\n Monitor the facilities and equipment and issue maintenance requests where appropriate;\n Arrange for the removal of any items from the work place that are not needed for the flow of business or\nthe comfort and enhancement of employees;\n Report to the Manager any existing or potential workplace hazards; and\n Ensure that all trash, waste, and scrap are properly disposed.\n\n---\n\nWhile the Company encourages friendly relationships between members of management and non-management\nemployees, it recognizes that involvement in a romantic relationship may compromise or create a perception that\ncompromises a member of management’s ability to perform his or her job. Any involvement of a romantic nature between a\nmanager or supervisor and anyone he or she supervises, either directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Violation of this policy\nmay lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination of the management individual involved in the relationship.\n\n**OPEN COMMUNICATION**\n\nAt E.N.D JEWELRY, communication is at the heart of good employee relations. Employees should share\ntheir concerns, seek information, provide input, and resolve work-related issues by discussing them with their\nsupervisors until they are fully resolved. It may not be possible to achieve the results an employee wants, but the\nsupervisor needs to attempt to explain in each case why a certain course of action is preferred. If an issue cannot be\nresolved at this level, the employee is welcome to discuss the issue with the Human Resources Manager, General\nManager, or Chief Executive Officer.\n\nRegardless of the situation, employees should be able to openly discuss any work-related problems and\nconcerns without fear of retaliation. Managers and supervisors are expected to listen to employee concerns,\nencourage their input, and seek resolution to the issues and concerns. Often this will require setting a meeting in the\nnear future. Managers and supervisors are to set these meetings as quickly as possible, and employees are expected\nto understand that issues and concerns may not always be addressed at the moment they arise. Discussing these\nissues and concerns with management will likely help to find an acceptable solution for nearly every situation.\n\nIf an employee has a concern about harassment or discrimination, E.N.D JEWELRY has set up special\nprocedures to\nreport and address those issues. The proper reporting procedures are set forth in the Harassment and Discrimination\npolicy.\n\n**OVERTIME**\n\nAll overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor and noted on the time reporting system.\nHolidays, personal leave and other personal absences will not be counted as working hours when computing\novertime pay. Overtime compensation will be one and one-half (1 ½) times the Employee's regular pay rate and will\nnot include any special form of compensation or bonuses.\n\n**PAY PERIODS**\n\nEmployees are paid on a Bi-weekly basis every other Friday. Day shift employees will receive their\npaycheck on Friday. Night shift employees will receive their paycheck on Thursday night after 8:00 pm. When such\npayday falls on a holiday or a non-business day, payday will be the preceding business day. If any error\noccurs on your paycheck, notify the General Manager. The error will be corrected as soon as possible. In the\nevent the employee’s paycheck is to be received by someone other than the employee, E.N.D JEWELRY\nmust have signed written instructions from the employee and E.N.D JEWELRY will require the person picking up\nthe paycheck to provide a picture identification card.\n\n**NON-FRATERNIZATION**\n\n---\n\nEmployees working in office areas should dress conservatively and professionally. Skirts and dresses should not\nbe any shorter than three (3) inches above the knee. Blue jeans and tee shirts are acceptable office dress unless otherwise\ndetermined by the General Manager, however dress standards still require a neat, clean appearance.

All clothing must be clean, neat, and fit properly.\n\nFor all employees, professional appearance also means that E.N.D JEWELRY expects you to maintain\ngood hygiene and grooming while working. Facial hair is permitted as long as it is neat and well trimmed. Earrings\nare acceptable; however, excessive numbers of earrings and other body piercing JEWELRY may not be worn during\nwork hours. All tattoos offensive in nature, as determined in the sole discretion of the General Manager, must be\ncovered at all times during work hours.\n\nClothing must not constitute a safety hazard. All employees should practice common sense rules of\nneatness, good taste, and comfort. Provocative clothing is prohibited. E.N.D JEWELRY reserves the right to\ndetermine appropriate dress at all times and in all circumstances and may send employees home to change clothes\nshould it be determined their dress is not appropriate. Employees will not be compensated for this time away from\nwork.\n\n**PERSONAL CONDUCT**\n\nE.N.D JEWELRY expects all employees to observe certain standards of behavior while at work.\nEmployees are to tret all other employees with respect and honor to one another and to, customers or visitors.\n\n Reporting to work on time when scheduled to begin and being at the proper work station, ready to\nwork at the assigned starting time;\n Notifying your supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin\nwhen you will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time;\n Complying with all safety rules and performing duties and operating equipment with care to\nprotect the safety of the employee, co-workers, and the public;\n Wearing clothing appropriate for the work being performed;\n Carrying out assigned duties in accordance with established quality standards and following\nreasonable instructions or requests from supervisors and/or management;\n Not posting any literature, handbills, petitions, posters, or other materials on the premises\nwithout the prior approval of the Manager;\n Refraining from soliciting funds or selling any item, commodity, or service without the prior\napproval of the Manager;\n Maintaining a clean and safe work area;\n Treating all customers, visitors, and fellow employees in a courteous and respectful manner;\n Using Company property or that of another employee in an appropriate manner;\n\nThe professional image of E.N.D JEWELRY is maintained, in part, by the image that our employees\npresent to customers, vendors, and other visitors.\n\n**PERSONAL APPEARANCE**\n\n---\n\n Obtaining authorization to remove Company property or another employee’s property from its location;\n Refraining from misuse, theft, or destruction of Company time and/or property or another employee’s\nproperty;\n Remaining in your work area, on the job, and awake during working hours;\n Refraining from the use of foul or offensive language or conduct that is offensive or undesirable;\n Not engaging in horseplay, pranks or practical jokes;\n Not gambling on Company property or during work hours;\n Not using personal cell phones during work hours, except to make calls when necessary for personal\nnecessity or emergencies;\n Properly wearing all safety equipment, ear protection, safety shoes and eye protection and following all\nCompany safety rules and policies.\n\nFailure to observe the above standards may result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.\n\n**PERSONAL INFORMATION CHANGES**\n\nYou are to notify Human Resources immediately if any changes occur in your:\n\n Legal name;\n Address;\n Telephone number;\n Emergency contact information;\n Number of dependents for tax purposes;\n Dependents covered by medical insurance;\n Beneficiary for life insurance and other employee benefit plans.\n\n**PERSONAL VISITORS**\n\nLike personal phone calls, limit personal visitors to necessity.
