When employees anticipate that they will be late or absent, they are required to\ntelephone their immediate supervisor to report the circumstances, advising how late they may be or how many days they may\nbe absent. Employees are to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the time your shift would normally begin\nwhen they will be absent from work or unable to report for work on time. The supervisor will note on the employee’s time\nsheet whether the lateness or absence is excused or unexcused and whether to pay or not pay. Failure to request advance\napproval or to timely report absence or lateness will result in the absence being recorded as unexcused and subject to\ndiscipline.\n\n Upon returning to work from an unexcused absence, an employee must report to his supervisor and disclose the\nreason for the absence. The supervisor may request a copy of support documents, i.e. doctor’s certificate, to substantiate the\nabsence. If the reason is not acceptable, the employee may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, verbal or\nwritten reprimand, or termination of employment.\n\n Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early\ndepartures as well as absence for an entire day.\n\n An employee who fails to call in for three successive days to report an absence shall be considered to\nhave voluntarily terminated employment from E.N.D JEWELRY.\n\n Employees who are to use the time data collection system are responsible for the accuracy of their time records.\nEmployees must log in when starting the workday and log out at the end of the workday. Employees are also to log\nout for their lunch break and anytime they leave the E.N.D JEWELRY property, unless leaving for business\npurposes as part of their job duties.

E.N.D JEWELRY prohibits and will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of\nany employee due to age, race, sex, religion, color, national origin, disability, or on any other basis that would be in\nviolation of any applicable federal, state, or local law.\n\nHarassment, as defined for this policy, consists of verbal, visual or physical conduct that belittles, demeans\nor shows hostility or aversion toward an individual for reasons including, but not limited to his/her gender, race,\nreligion, color, national origin, age, sexual preference or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates,\n\nand that: ¢ has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment;\n. has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or\n. otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.\n\nSexual Harassment, as defined for this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual comments, advances, request for\n\nsexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\n. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\nemployment;\n\n. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions\naffecting such individual; or\n\n. such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work\n\nenvironment.\n\nProhibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or\n\ncontact to physical contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is offensive or harassing to others.\nExamples of conduct which could be considered sexual harassment include:\n\n. persistent or repeated unwelcome flirting, pressure for dates, sexual comments, or touching;\n\n---\n\n## Page 9\n\n sexually suggestive jokes or gestures directed toward another or sexually oriented or degrading\n comments about another;\n  preferential treatment of an employee or a promise of preferential treatment to an employee in exchange\n for dates or sexual conduct, or the denial or threat of denial of employment benefits or advancements for\n refusal to consent to sexual advances;\n  the open display of sexually oriented pictures, posters, or other material offensive to others; and\n  retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct.\n All employees are encouraged to express displeasure at any conduct which might be sexually harassing, to\ntell the individual engaging in the conduct that it is unwelcome, and to report the conduct as described in this policy.\n\n Occasionally, talking with a supervisor or another employee about the harassment is not sufficient for\nreporting a complaint of harassment. If you feel you are being harassed, you should immediately inform the person\nharassing you that his or her behavior is unwelcome and must stop. You should always promptly report the matter\nto the General Manager. Although, delayed reporting of a complaint could hinder the Company’s ability to\neffectively investigate the complaint, it will not in and of itself preclude the Company from investigating the matter\nand taking appropriate action.\n\n If the person you feel is harassing you is General Manager, you should contact the Chief Executive\nOfficer of E.N.D JEWELRY, immediately.\n\n E.N.D JEWELRY has no requirement for the form or content of a harassment complaint. Although the\ncomplaint may be verbal, a written statement may be required as part of the investigation to be conducted by E.N.D\nJEWELRY. Allegations of harassment and discrimination are taken very seriously. You have a duty to fully\ncomply with the investigation. You should provide as much information as possible regarding the\noffending incident or conduct, including what happened or is continuing to happen, the person or persons\ncausing the harassment, and the time(s) and place(s) that the incident(s) or conduct occurred. If available,\nthe names of witnesses should be provided, but you should not hesitate to report harassment merely because\nwitnesses are not available or cannot be identified.\n\n All complaints will be investigated promptly. The complaint will be investigated in as confidential of a\nmanner as possible, but confidentiality cannot be promised. If an investigation confirms that harassment in violation\nof this policy has occurred, E.N.D JEWELRY will take appropriate corrective action as determined by it in its sole\ndiscretion. The corrective action may include discipline up to and including termination. The extent and type of\ncorrective action taken may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of the particular\nemployee and the nature of the offense. There will be no retaliation by E.N.D JEWELRY against any employee\nwho makes a good-faith report, even if, after investigation, it appears that there has been no violation. However,\nfalse reports are another form of harassment and should not be made.\n\n If either party directly involved in a harassment or discrimination investigation is dissatisfied with\nthe outcome or resolution, that individual has the right to appeal the decision by submitting his or her written\ncomments in a timely manner to the General Manager of E.N.D JEWELRY\n\n HOLIDAYS\n\n It Is the policy of E.N.D JEWELRY to designate and observe certain days each year as holidays.
