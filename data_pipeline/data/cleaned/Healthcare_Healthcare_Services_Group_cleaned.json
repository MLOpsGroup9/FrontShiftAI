The\nperformance standards listed below, and others which may be established from time to time obviously are not\nall-inclusive, but are intended only to indicate some of the types of actions that are unacceptable in the\nworkplace. These performance standards are merely examples of the types of misconduct for which employees\nmay be disciplined or dismissed. By providing these examples, the Company in no way restricts its legal\ndiscretion to discipline employees or terminate the employment relationship at will. Unacceptable conduct not\nspecifically listed may, nonetheless, result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. If an employee\nneeds clarification of a specific issue related to these standards, she/he should seek clarification from his/her\nimmediate supervisor, or the Healthcare Services Group, Inc.

By protecting the patients/residents from any harmful germs,\nemployees are also protecting themselves. There are five ways to transmit bacteria that can cause\ninfection:\n\n 1. Direct contact with infected person.\n\n 2. Indirect contact with objects contaminated by the infected person.\n\n 3. The inhalation of air-borne dust or droplets contaminating the infected agents.\n\n 4. Spread through insects.\n\n 5. Inoculation.\n\n Some Things to Remember:\n\n 1. Use an effective quaternary germicidal solution along with systematic cleaning of all\n resident rooms and bathrooms.\n\n 2. All surfaces must be exposed to the chemical agent. Anything short of actual contact\n will not do the job.\n\n 3. Always dilute properly: too little will be ineffective, too much will be wasteful.\n\n 4. Never use a chemical on any surface until you are sure that it is safe for that purpose.\n\n 5. Since chemicals are liquid and could be swallowed, all bottles must be labeled with\n contents, ingredients, and antidote.\n\n 6. No cleaning or working around food while it is being served.\n\n 7. Change water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentation\n which will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution.\n\n 8. Complete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breeding\n grounds.\n\n 9. Follow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry.\n\n 10. Linen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination.\n\n 11. Where required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect any\n communicable disease.\n\n 12. Use hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because the\n disinfecting agents are still at work on your skin.\n\n 13. Make sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs.\n\nINFECTION CONTROL\n\nBecause many of the patients/residents of a health care facility have weakened defenses and\nare more prone to getting sick, it is important that our employees use extra care to maintain as\nsanitary an environment as possible.

Anything short of actual contact\nwill not do the job.\n\nAlways dilute properly: too little will be ineffective, too much will be wasteful.\nNever use a chemical on any surface until you are sure that it is safe for that purpose.\n\nSince chemicals are liquid and could be swallowed, all bottles must be labeled with\ncontents, ingredients, and antidote.\n\nNo cleaning or working around food while it is being served.\n\nChange water often. Failure to do this will result in cloudiness and sedimentation\nwhich will lessen the effectiveness of the germicidal solution.\n\nComplete routine cleaning of closets and drawers to eliminate insect breeding\ngrounds.\n\nFollow all isolation procedures for linen and laundry.\nLinen and laundry procedures must be designed to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nWhere required, schedule and receive initial chest x-ray or Tine Tests to detect any\ncommunicable disease.\n\nUse hand lotion. It is a good practice to use hand lotion after cleaning because the\ndisinfecting agents are still at work on your skin.\n\nMake sure all equipment is kept clean or it could be a breeding ground for germs.\n\n---\n\n## Page 32\n\nSUBSTANCE ABUSE\n\n In order to fulfill our responsibility to provide reliable and safe service to our clients\nand a safe working environment for our employees, employees of Healthcare must be\nphysically and mentally capable to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.\nTherefore, no employee shall work or report to work while under the influence of alcohol,\nillegal drugs, or drugs which would affect their ability to perform the job in a safe and efficient\nmanner.\n\n No employee shall consume, display, or have in his/her possession any alcoholic\nbeverages or illegal drugs at any time during the work day, including in the workplace, in\nCompany vehicles, during lunch, breaks, and on-call hours. To do so could jeopardize the\nsafety of other employees, the public, Company equipment, and the Company's relationships\nwith its clients and the public, and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ndismissal.\n\n Should employees be required to take any kind of prescription or nonprescription medical\ntreatment which may potentially affect their job performance, they are required to report this to\ntheir supervisor, who will determine if it is necessary to temporarily place them on another\nassignment to ensure their safety and the safety of other employees and the public.\n\n To protect the best interests of employees and the public, Healthcare will take whatever\nmeasures are necessary to determine if alcohol or illegal drugs are located in, or are being used\nat, the workplace. These measures will not be taken unreasonably, but when the Company\nbelieves them to be justified and necessary. Measures that may be used will include, but not be\nlimited to, searches of people and of personal property located at the workplace, possibly by\nlaw enforcement authorities, as well as drug and/or alcohol tests to be conducted when there is\nreasonable suspicion of substance abuse. In addition, employees who suffer, or contribute to, a\nwork-related accident requiring medical treatment for any employee or facility\npatient/resident, will be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing if it is possible that an\nimpaired condition could have contributed to the accident.\n\n When urinalysis and/or blood tests are requested or necessary, samples will be taken\nunder the supervision of an appropriate health care professional. The searches and drug tests\nwill not be conducted if an individual refuses to submit to them. However, refusal to submit\nwill result in immediate removal from service and normally will result in termination.\n\n Employees experiencing problems with alcohol or other drugs are urged to voluntarily\nseek assistance to resolve such problems before they become serious enough to require\nmanagement referral or disciplinary action. A portion of the cost of treatment may be covered\nby your medical insurance program. Successful treatment will be viewed positively.
