We are pleased\nto have you join our award-winning Hospitality\nServices department. We know you have lots\nof choices for where to work in the Hospitality\nindustry, and we’re glad you chose Western. You’re\nnow part of a team who cares deeply about taking\ncare of our guests, and contribute to a supportive\ncampus community made up of faculty, staff,\nresearchers, alumni, and our 35,000 students.\n\nWe consist of five distinct teams - Campus\nEateries, Residence Dining, Great Hall Catering,\nConference Services, and Vending Services, and\nprovide contract management to the Ivey School\nof Business. While each area serves a specific\nclientele, we are all part of the same team and\nwork collectively towards shared outcomes.\n\nFeeding over 25,000 people on campus daily,\nHospitality Services staff are key to delivering\nCanada’s “Best Student Experience”. We all deliver\nexceptional customer service everyday in different\n\nways; learning our guest’s names, remembering\ntheir regular orders, striking up friendly\nconversations, asking how a student did on their\nmidterm - our Alumni often return to campus\nand seek out Hospitality employees who made a\ndifference in their experience at Western.\n\nI encourage you to spend some time looking\nthrough the Employee Handbook carefully and\nreturn the signed acknowledgement form to\nyour Supervisor within two weeks of receiving\nthis publication.\n\nAgain, I am extremely pleased to welcome you to\nHospitality Services and look forward to working\nwith you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Alleyne\n*Associate Vice-President*\n*Housing & Ancillary Services*\n\n## Welcome to the Team!\n\n| | |\n|--|--|\n\n---\n\n---\n\n##### Policy on\n##### Emergencies\n\n##### Services\n##### at Western\n\n##### Allergies,\n##### Sustainability\n##### & Workplace\n##### Wellness\n\n##### Communication\n\n##### Welcome\n\n##### Forms\n\n##### Workplace\n##### Policies\n\n##### Working\n##### Safely\n##### with Food\n\n##### Health\n##### and Safety\n\nFireFire ExtinguishersAccident & Incident ReportingAccident/Illness/Incident Reporting..EmergenciesStudent Emergency\nResponse Team (SERT)Workplace WellnessFood Allergies & IntolerancesSymptoms of an Allergic ReactionEmergency ResponseAccommodating Students\nwith AllergiesSustainabilityGet Connected, Stay InformedDirector’s WelcomeContentsCampus MapStaff DirectoryMission, Vision and ValuesReturn to Campus (Covid)Health ScreeningAttendance RequirementsCall-in ProceduresUnable to Report for WorkAbsence from WorkMedical NotesEmployee Meal PolicySnackingMeal PlansMulti-Factor Authentication\n(MFA)Hazard Analysis Critical Control\nPoint (HAACP)Personal HygieneHandwashingGlovesCleaning & SanitizingFood Holding TemperaturesCooling, Reheating & ThawingThermometersCross ContaminationLiftingKnife HandlingPreventing CutsPersonal Protective Equipment\n(PPE)Using ChemicalsOccupational Health & Safety ActJoint Health & Safety CommitteesLifeWorks (EAP)Responsiiblites of WorkersRights of WorkersResponsiiblites of the EmployerOnline Training# Contents\n\nStaff/Faculty Family\nPractice ClinicMental HealthEmployee Well-beingPhysiotherapy & MassagePayroll CoordinatorWestern ONECardParking ServicesUniversity Child CareWestern Foot PatrolUniform Order FormHandbook acknowledgment---\n\n![Western Housing \"Mi First-Year](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_6_2.png)\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_6_5](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_6_5.png)\n\n| Campus Map | | |\n|------------|--|--|\n| | | |\n| | | |\n\n---\n\nHospitality Services -

Passwords can often be\nstolen, guessed, or compromised - you might not\neven know someone is accessing your account.\nMulti‐factor authentication adds a second layer of\nsecurity, keeping your account secure even if your\npassword is compromised.\n\n## How Does It Work?\n\nMFA provides you with the best level of security,\nit’s fast and easy to use. When you log into an\nMFA protected site, service or application, such\nas Office 365, you will enter your User ID and\npassword as you normally do and you will use a\nsecondary factor as well. MFA adds a second layer\nof protection by combining something you know\n(your password) with something you have (your\nphone, or security token) to verify your identity.\nThis combination will prevent someone else from\ngaining access to your account, even if they have\ncompromised your password.\n\nOnce you have set up your Duo Security profile\nyou are ready to go. You will login as usual with\nyour User ID and password, and then use your\ndevice to verify that it’s you. This can be done\nvia SMS, voice call, one time passcode, the Duo\nMobile smartphone app, and so on.\n\n## No mobile phone?\n\nYou can also use a landline or tablet, or obtain a\nhardware token. Duo lets you link multiple devices\nto your account, so you can use your mobile\nphone and a landline, a landline and a hardware\ntoken, two different mobile devices, etc.\n\n# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\n---\n\n## HAACP\n\nHospitality Services uses a universally recognized\nFood Safety Program called HACCP (Hazard\nAnalysis Critical Control Point). This seven-step\nprogram tracks food products from the farm to\nthe fork, removing all hazards by identifying food\nhazards and critical control points.\n\nYour role is to ensure that all products are safely\nhandled from the moment we receive it at\nour loading docks to the point our customers\nconsume it.\n\nCareful monitoring, documentation and record\nkeeping are shared responsibilities to ensure we\nkeep our self and customers safe.\n\n## Personal Hygiene\n\nPoor personal hygiene can compromise the\nsafety of our food service establishment. Students\nand Staff can become ill. It is the responsibility\nof all staff members to follow a high standard of\npersonal hygiene which includes daily baths or\nshowers, wearing a clean uniform, retraining hair\nwith a hair net and proper handwashing.\n\n## Handwashing\n\nUnclean hands are the prime culprits in\ntransmitting contaminants to food and there is no\nbetter means of sanitizing hands than frequent\nand through handwashing.\n\n**WHEN DO I WAS MY HANDS?**\n\n- Before starting my shift\n- After using the restroom\n\n- After touching face or hair or clothing\n- After sneezing, coughing or blowing nose\n- After handing raw food\n- After eating and taking breaks\n- After smoking\n- After handling dirty dishes\n- After handling garbage\n\n- After handling chemicals\n## Gloves\n\nGloves may be worn at a customer’s request,\nto protect a cut or when handling ready to eat\nfood. Gloves are single use or task only. Gloves\ncan become contaminated just as easily as a\nworker’s hands. They are intended to be changed\nfrequently, never washed but discarded after use.\n\n## Cleaning & Sanitizing\n\n# Working Safely with Food\n\n| | |\n|--|--|\n| | |\n| | |\n\n| | |\n|--|--|\n| | |\n\n---\n\n## Food Holding Temperatures\n\n**Minimize the time food spends in the**\n**temperature danger zone 40°F (5°C) to 140°F**\n**(60°C)** . Potentially harmful bacteria find this zone\nhighly hospitable and begin to multiple quickly.\n\nWhen it is necessary to hold hot foods for any\nlength of time only equipment intended for\nsuch purposes should be used (e.g. steam table\nor hot cabinet).\n\n- Keep **HOT** things **HOT** **above** **140°F (60°C)**\n\n- When holding cold food out of refrigeration onlyequipment intended for such purposes should\nbe used. e.g. deli counter, ice bath\n\n- Keep **COLD** things **COLD** **below 40°F (4°C)**\n## Cooling\n\nAll cooked food must be chilled quickly to **40°F**\n( **4°C** ) within 6 hours to prevent a potential\nfood-borne illness. Large quantity batches\ncan be chilled using an ice bath, with an\nice wand or divided into\nshallow pans to increase the\nsurface area before storing\nin the refrigerator. Use a\nthermometer to determine\nthe internal temperature of\nthe product.\n\n## Reheating\n\nPrecooked foods to be\nreheated must be rewarmed\nrapidly to **165°F (74°C)** using\nequipment to do so. A hot\nbox or steam table is not\nappropriate for reheating.\n\n## Thawing\n\nProducts should be thawed under refrigeration\nor under cold running water in their original\nwrapping never at room temperature.\n\n## Thermometers\n\nMetal Stem or Instant Read Digital thermometers\nare available to check product internal\ntemperatures. These thermometers need to be\ncleaned between uses with alcohol swabs and\nshould be calibrated frequently.\n\nAll fridges and Freezers are equipped with\nthermometers and should be checked regularly.\n\n## Cross Contamination\n\nIt is important to take all precautions to avoid\nCross Contamination of products meaning the\nprocess by which bacteria, microorganisms\nor hazardous materials are unintentionally\ntransferred from one product to another with\nharmful effect through careless practices.\n\n**To avoid cross contamination practice**\n**the following:**\n\n- Wash hands between tasks\n\n- Sanitize thermometers after each use\n\n- When thawing raw foods in therefrigerator, place them on the\nlowest shelf\n\n- Use a clean designated scoop for ice, donot use hands or other container\n\n- All staff beverages should be in a cupwith lid and stored in designated area to\navoid spilling and contaminating food\nprep areas\n\n- Keep ready to eat items apart fromraw items\n\nCOOKING ZONE\n\nDANGER ZONE\n\nCOLD ZONE\n\n---\n\n## Safety\n\nAll employees share in the responsibility of\nmaintaining Hospitality services as a safe\nworking environment. If you see a potential\nhazard or notice something unsafe, notify a\nsupervisor immediately.\n\n## Lifting\n\n- Ask for help when lifting heavy or largeawkward containers\n\n- Keep your back straight and bend kneeswhile lifting\n\n- Hold items close while lifting; don’t reach foritems fat from your body\n\n## Knife Handling\n\n- Inspect the knife before use\n\n- Use a sharp knife\n\n- Do not use damaged knife\n\n- Use the correct type of knife for the job\n\n- Always use a cutting board with corner grips\n\n- Wear cut resistant gloves\n\n- Use a scrub brush to clean and sanitize knifehandle and blade\n\n- Do not place knives in sink\n\n- Take micro breaks to relieve muscles\n\n- Store knives in designated areas\n\n- Do not attempt to catch a falling knife\n\n- Carry knife down at your side when walkingthrough the kitchen\n\n- Do not use a knife for tasks other than cutting\n# Health & Safety\n\n---\n\n## Preventing Cuts\n\n- Only operate equipment after properinstruction\n\n- Pay attention to sharp blades\n\n- Sweep up broken glass and dispose in adesignated container\n\n- Remove lids entirely from cans and dispose ofin the recycle container not the garbage\n\n## Personal Protective\n## Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe Workplace Hazardous Materials Information\nSystem (WHMIS) ensures that all controlled\nproducts used, stored, handled or disposed of in\nour workplace are properly labelled and Safety\nData Sheets SDS are made available.\n\nBefore using any chemical always refer to the\nproducts Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for appropriate\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE).\n\nProtect yourself with safety glasses, rubber\ngloves and correct protective clothing such as\nplastic aprons when handling full concentration\nchemicals or as directed in the SDS Sheets.\n\nOven mitts and non-cut gloves are also mandatory\nPPE when handling hot items or using sharp knives.\n\n## Using Chemicals\n\n- Review and understand SDS (Safety DataSheets) on all chemicals you use\n\n- Always read the labels\n\n- Measure all chemicals per instructions\n\n- Never mix one type of chemical with another\n\n- Do not rely on the smell of chemicals as meansof identification\n\n## Occupational Health &\n## Safety Act\n\nThe purpose of Occupational Health and Safety\n(OH&S) legislation is to protect you, the worker,\nagainst hazards on the job. It outlines the general\nrights and responsibilities of the employer, the\nsupervisor and the worker. The law makes both\nyou and your employer jointly responsible for\nworkplace health and safety.\n\n---\n\n## Joint Health &\n## Safety Committees\n\nWestern University as an employer is responsible\nunder the Occupational Health and Safety Act,\nfor establishing and maintaining Joint Health\nand Safety Committees. These committees are\nadvisory bodies composed of representatives\nof workers and management. Their primary\nfunctions are the identification of workplace\nhealth and safety hazards and making\nrecommendations to management with respects\nto workplace health and safety. In order to carry\nout these duties, they perform regular inspections\nof the workplace.\n\n**The Joint Health and Safety Committee has**\n**several important rights and responsibilities:**\n\n- Recognize workplace hazards\n\n- Evaluate the hazards and risks that may causeincidents, injuries and illness\n\n- Participate in development andimplementation of programs to protect the\nemployees’ safety and health\n\n- Respond to employee complaints andsuggestions concerning safety and health\n\n- Monitor and follow-up hazard reports andrecommend action\n\n- Participate in safety and health inquiries andinvestigations, as appropriate\n\n- Consult with professional and technical experts\n\n- Participate in resolving workplace refusals andwork stoppages\n\n- Make recommendations to managementfor incident prevention and safety program\nactivities\n\n- Monitor effectiveness of safety programs andprocedures\n\n## LifeWorks -\n## Employee Assistance (HR)\n\nLifeWorks (formerly Morneau-Shepell) is Western’s\nprovider of a confidential Employee Assistance\nProgram (EAP). The program can help you to\noptimize your current well-being, or support you\nas you take the first step toward change. You can\naccess help to find solutions to the challenges you\nface at any age and stage of your life.\n\nEAP is available to all Western employees\nand their dependents. It was rebranded and\nrelaunched as LifeWorks in early 2021, so\nemployees were asked to register to access the\nnew online platform and app. The same great\ncare is always available by phone anytime.\n\n## Responsibilities of Workers\n\nWorkers also have several general duties under\nthe Act. A worker must take responsibility for\npersonal health and safety insofar as they are\nable. Under the Act, a worker must:\n\n- Work in compliance with the Act andregulations\n\n- Use or wear any equipment, protective devicesor clothing required by the Employer (ie.\nFootwear, protective glasses, head protection,\nmasks, etc.)\n\n- Report to the Employer or Supervisor anyknown missing or defective equipment or\nprotective device that may be dangerous\n\n- Report any known workplace hazard orviolations of the Act to the Employer of\nSupervisor\n\n![LifeWorks](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_19_23.png)\n\n---\n\n- Not remove or make ineffective any protectivedevice required by the Employer or by the\nregulations\n\n## Rights of the Workers\n\n- Right to select a worker representative\n\n- Right to refuse or stop unsafe work\n\n- Right to participate through JHSC (JointOccupational Health & Safety Committee)\n\n- Right to know\n## Responsibilities of\n## the Employer\n\nEmployers’ legal safety and health\nresponsibilities include:\n\n- Make sure that work areas, machinery andequipment are kept in a safe condition\n\n- Organize ways of working safely\n\n- Provide information, instruction, training andsupervision of employees so they can work\nsafely\n\n- Make sure that employees are aware ofpotential hazards\n\n- Report all accidents and injuries to the Ministryof Labour\n\n## Online Training\n\nAdditional online training expectations include\nWorker health & Safety, AODA (Accessibility\nfor Ontarians with Disabilities), Safe Campus\ncommunity (Bill 168) and WHIMIS. The\nexpectation is that all the online training\nis completed within one week of receiving\nyour Western Username & Password. Further\ninstructions will be provided.\n\n---\n\n## Fire\n\nIn case of fire accidents, fumes and theft,\nindividuals should **call University Police at**\n**ext. 83300 or 911 immediately.** When a fire is\ndiscovered, the building must be evacuated. If\nit is safe to do so, all doors to the fire area should\nbe closed and the nearest wall mounted fire\nalarm activated. When the fire alarm rings,\nthe building must be evacuated as quickly as\npossible but elevators must not be used. Doors\nand windows in the area should be closed.\nThe building must not be re-entered until\nauthorization to do so has been given by the Fire\nDepartment or Western Police.\n\nAll cooking appliances should be turned off and\nfood that could catch on fire should be removed\nfrom its’ heat source (French fries should be\nremoved from the deep fryer).\n\nIf the fire is under a kitchen hood, activate the\nfire extinguishing system using a manual “Range\nGuard” pull station. You must also pull the nearest\nfire alarm to sound the building alarm.\n\n## Fire Extinguishers\n\nThere may be up to three different types of fire\nextinguishers in your kitchen:\n\n- **Multipurpose Extinguisher (ABC):** This type ofextinguisher will extinguish all types of fires.\n\n- **BC Extinguisher:** This type of extinguisherworks extremely well on grease fires, and can\nbe used on any flammable liquid fires involving\nelectricity.\n\n- **Range Guard Fire Extinguishing System:**This fire extinguishing system is located in the\nexhaust ducts and hoods over certain cooking\nappliances. It will operate automatically if there\nis a fire on a cooing appliance, or manually\nif the pin in a Range Guard pull station is\nremoved. This system, when activated will\nshut off all fuel sources to the appliances under\nthe hood, discharge the extinguishing agent\non the appliances and an alarm will sound. A\nfire alarm must also be pulled to sound the\nbuilding alarm.\n\n# Policy on Emergencies\n\n![WHEN USING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER,](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_12.png)\n\n![TYPEOF | APPROVED FIRE CLASS OF](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_13.png)\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_14](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_14.png)\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_15](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_15.png)\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_16](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_21_16.png)\n\n---\n\n## Accident & Incident Reporting\n\nAll continuing, sessional and part-time\nemployees of the University are covered under\nthe Workers’ Compensation Act for injuries\nand illnesses resulting from their employment.\nCoverage includes payment for health care costs\nand loss of earnings due to time lost from work.\n\nIt is therefore, extremely important that all\nwork-related accidents, injuries, or occupational\ndiseases be reported promptly to your Supervisor\nor Unit Manager.

Their body reacts to\nthe food (an allergen) by having an allergic reaction\n- even a small amount of an allergen has the\npotential to cause a reaction. And, unfortunately\nthere is no cure for a food allergy; avoidance is the\nonly way to prevent a reaction.\n\nAt Western, we house and serve many students\n(staff and/or faculty) with food allergies and\nintolerances. While anaphylaxis (the most severe\ntype of reaction) can lead to death if untreated,\nfatalities can often be avoided.\n\n## Symptoms of an\n## Allergic Reaction\n\nAn allergic reaction\ncan result in any\nof the following\nsymptoms, which\nmay appear alone or\nin any combination,\nregardless of the\ntriggering allergens.\n\nThink **F.A.S.T.**\nand look for the\nfollowing signs:\n\n**Face:** Itchiness,\nredness, swelling of\nface and tongue\n\n**Airway:** Trouble breathing, swallowing or\nspeaking\n\n**Stomach** : Nausea, pain/cramps, vomiting,\ndiarrhea\n\n**Total Body:** Rash, itchiness, swelling, weakness,\npaleness, sense of doom, loss of consciousness.\n\n![S Mrantrcmn = ALLERGIC REACTIONS](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_23_18.png)\n\n# Workplace Wellness, Allergies &\n\n---\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_2](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_2.png)\n\n![) S 7Ree WU V@](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_3.png)\n\n![Swepise](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_4.png)\n\n![Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_5](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_5.png)\n\n![MILK](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_6.png)\n\n![Surpan®](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_7.png)\n\n![Austp?](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_8.png)\n\n![GtuTes](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_9.png)\n\n![FISH](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_10.png)\n\n![EGG](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_11.png)\n\n![PEANUT?](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Hospitality_Western_University_Hospitality_Services_image_24_12.png)\n\n```shell\n# Workplace Wellness, Allergies &\n# Sustainability\n## Emergency Response\n```\n\nThere are five key steps to take in the emergency\nmanagement of a reaction:\n\n1. **Administer epinephrine** (ie., EpiPen orAllerject) at the first signs of an allergic\nreaction. Epinephrine will not cause harm\nif given unnecessarily to an individual not\nexperiencing an allergic reaction. Staff should\nonly assist in administering epinephrine if/\nwhen the person having the reaction is unable\nto do so themselves.\n\n1. **Call 9-1-1 from a campus phone**\n\n2. **Individuals feeling faint or dizzy, should****lie down unless they are vomiting or**\n**experiencing severe respiratory distress**\n**(trouble breathing).**\n\n1. **If there is no improvement in symptoms after****five minutes, a second dose of epinephrine**\n**can be administered by SERT.**\n\n1. **Immediately report the incident** to your UnitManager and/or Supervisor.\n\nEducation and awareness are key to keeping our\nallergic community safe.

We encourage our students with\nfood allergies to self-identify so that we can work\ntogether to keep them safe. It is, therefore, very\nimportant that patrons with food allergies have\ntheir inquiries dealt with accurately, completely,\nand promptly.
