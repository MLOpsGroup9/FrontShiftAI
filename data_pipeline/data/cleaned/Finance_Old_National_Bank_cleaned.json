The Company considers several factors when evaluating the relative value of\nevery job. These include:\n\nEssential Duties and Responsibilities\n- Required Management Skills and Responsibilities\n- Dimensional Data\n- Required Knowledge, Skills, Abilities\n- Level of Client Interactions and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of an evaluation system is to evaluate each position within the Company accurately and fairly, based on job\nresponsibilities. The Job Evaluation system measures the actual content of jobs to predict competitive pay rates and to\nidentify the appropriate career level for the position.\n\nPay Ranges\nEach career level carries a specific pay range, which is defined by a minimum, a midpoint, and a maximum. The range\nminimum represents the minimum pay for a given position. If a team member is in a position and their skills and\nperformance meet the minimum requirements, their pay would be near the minimum of their job’s pay range.\n\nThe range midpoint represents the relative market value of a pay range. As skills and experience increase and the\nquality of performance is fully meeting expectations, pay increases will gradually move the team member’s pay closer\nto the midpoint of the job’s pay range. The midpoint of a pay range for each career level is higher than the midpoint of\nthe preceding career level. However, the ranges are broad enough to provide some overlap with lower or higher career\nlevels. In fact, a particular pay level may fall within the range of two or more career levels.\n\nThe maximum of a salary range represents the highest possible value of the job. Team members generally will not\nreceive increases beyond the maximum of their current job grade. Please contact HR Shared Services for further\ninformation.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nConflicts of interest can harm the Company when someone’s outside interest or relationship interferes, or appears to\ninterfere, with their ability to make decisions and act in the best interest of Old National. We recognize our team\nmembers have a broad range of personal and community interests and involvement and we strive to find the right\nbalance between supporting those pursuits and protecting the reputation, brand, and financial success of the\nCompany. In some cases, the mere potential for conflict or the appearance of a conflict can be a problem, therefore,\nteam members should avoid situations which affect their ability to be objective and impartial or their loyalties may\nbecome divided.

Old National is a\nWork/Life company, and that means that we are committed to, whenever possible, working with our team members to\nachieve a fit that ensures that both work duties and other responsibilities are fulfilled.\n\nAlternative Work Schedules are a part of this commitment. Although not every position may be conducive to alternative\nwork arrangements, managers will review each situation individually to meet team member needs while maintaining\nadequate staffing levels and providing superior customer service. Alternative work arrangements include, but are not\nlimited to, compressed work weeks, part-time hours, job sharing, reduced and/or flex hours. While these options are\nnot an entitlement, when managers and team members work together, they can turn a challenge into a true win-win\nsituation.\n\nIf you encounter a situation that leads you to believe that an Alternative Work Schedule would meet your needs, you\nshould carefully consider how it will impact your department and be prepared with possible solutions when you meet\nwith your manager to request the Alternative Work Schedule.\n\nMore information regarding Alternative Work Schedules, including the request form can be found in MyHR.\n\nEmployment Categories\nEmployment categories are established so that team members will understand their employment status and benefit\neligibility.\n\nEach team member is assigned to either a Non-Exempt or Exempt category according to Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA) requirements.

Examples include summer employment, college internships, vacation relief, etc.\nEmployment assignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated period does\nnot in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary team members retain their status until notified in\nwriting of a change.

To qualify for Parental Leave, a team member must be\neither Full-Time or Part-Time Level |, have one or more year of service at the time of the Parental Event, and use one\nweek of PTO for the first week of paid leave associated with the Parental Event.\n\nA paid leave for a birthing parent begins with Short-Term Disability (i.e. Medical), which typically lasts for six weeks\nfollowed by up to an additional six weeks of bonding time. When eligible for a parental leave as a birth parent, the ShortTerm Disability (Medical) and bonding time are treated as one continuous leave for pay purposes, and leave benefits are\npaid according to the Short-Term Disability chart in the table above. Non-birthing parents must also use one week of\nPTO as the first week of their leave and will receive up to an additional five paid weeks to also provide up to six weeks of\npaid bonding time in total with leave benefits paid according to the Caregiver Leave chart in the table above.\n\nBirthing team members that do not meet the eligibility requirements for parental leave, may be eligible for medical/shortterm disability leave at the time of birth until medically released by their healthcare provider.\n\nPaid parental leave may also qualify for FMLA and/or state law protection.\n\nCOMMISSION BASED TEAM MEMBERS\n\nLeave pay for team members paid on a commission basis will be based on a team member's basic monthly earnings.\nCommissions shall be averaged for the 24 months that are prior to the date the leave began. If employed less than 24\nmonths, the commissions shall be averaged for the total number of months employed. Any commission payments that\ncontinue after the leave begins cannot be considered as part of the basic monthly earnings. Commissions do not\ninclude arbitrary commissions not directly related to the team member’s production. Team members will be eligible to\nreceive any net commissions earned during the period of disability in excess of the basic monthly earnings.

The\nnature of our business requires us to continue to operate regardless of conditions that might otherwise close other\nbusinesses. Old National is committed to the safety and well-being of all team members and will take appropriate steps\nto make sure team members feel safe when continuing business operations during emergency conditions including\npermitting team members to perform work from home when possible.\n\nThe following guidelines explain various scenarios and how the company will pay you when an emergency scenario\noccurs.\n\nIf your business, branch, or department closes during your working hours:\n\nIn extreme cases, when inclement weather conditions or another emergency situation develops during the day,\n\nmanagement may decide to close all or part of its business operations.\n\n+ All team members who are instructed to leave early as a result of closed operations will be paid for their normally\nscheduled hours that day. Team members who are in a role that work can be performed remotely (home or\nanother ONB location) will be expected to do so. Those team members should work with their managers on\ndetermining a remote location to work.\n\n+ Team members may be asked to work on a day when their department is officially closed. In these circumstances,\nnon-exempt team members who work will receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times the team member's base\nrate of pay. Please contact HR Shared Services for assistance regarding the proper coding of the time.\n\n+ In departments with flexible scheduling options, non-exempt team members should attempt to make up missed\nhours as determined to be appropriate by management.
