These documents are available in full detail to all\nemployees on a shared drive. Employees will be asked to affirm that they understand where to\naccess such detailed policies and procedures.\n\nCrouse Medical Practice strives to provide an employee-friendly environment in which goaloriented individuals thrive. Our company commitment to serving patients and providing quality\npatient care is unwavering. These policies, procedures and working conditions provide a work\nenvironment in which both patient and employee interests are served.\n\nWe value our employees’ talents, skills and abilities and seek to foster an open, cooperative and\ndynamic environment in which we can all excel. Crouse Medical Practice provides an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to bring ideas and challenges to any level of\nmanagement.\n\nThis handbook contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be\ncomprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general\npolicies and procedures described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning\neligibility for a particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should\naddress your specific questions to the Human Resources Department.\n\nNo provision in this handbook can be waived without written permission from Crouse Medical\nPractice’s President, or designee.\n\n##### At-Will Employment Statement\n\nEmployment with Crouse Medical Practice is on an “at-will” basis, which means that either an\nemployee or Crouse Medical Practice may terminate the employment relationship at any time,\nfor any reason, with or without cause. This handbook is not a contract of employment nor is it\nintended to create contractual obligations for the company of any kind or alter the at-will\nemployment relationships between Crouse Medical Practice and our employees. Only a written\ncontract can change the at-will nature of the employment of any individual.\n\nNeither this handbook nor any other Crouse Medical Practice document confers any contractual\nright, either expressed or implied, to remain in Crouse Medical Practice's employ. Nor does it\nguarantee any fixed terms and conditions of your employment. Your employment is not set for\nany specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice by\nCrouse Medical Practice, or you may resign for any reason, at any time. While there are\ndisciplinary processes in place, in certain situations, the Company may make the decision to\nterminate you without first taking these disciplinary steps.\n\n---\n\nNo supervisor or other representative of Crouse Medical Practice except the Owner and/or\nPresident has the authority to enter into any contract of employment for any specified period of\ntime, or to make any agreement contrary to the above.\n\nThe policies and procedures outlined will be applied at the discretion of Crouse Medical Practice\nmanagement. As such, Crouse Medical Practice may deviate from the policies, procedures,\nbenefits and working conditions described in this handbook. The company may also withdraw or\nchange the policies, procedures, benefits and working conditions described in this handbook at\nany time, for any reason. While it is our goal to provide employees with notice of such changes,\nprior notice is not required before a change is implemented. Throughout an employee’s\nemployment with Crouse Medical Practice, it is his or her responsibility to remain up to date on\ncompany policies, procedures, benefits and work conditions-both published and unpublished.\n\nSome of the subjects described here are covered in detail in official benefit policy documents.\nYou should refer to those documents for specific information since this handbook only briefly\nsummarizes those benefits. Please note that the terms of the written insurance policies are\ncontrolling.\n\n##### Crouse Health System\n\n![Crouse Health System, Inc. Crouse](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice_image_8_8.png)\n\n---\n\n##### Mission, Vision, and Values\n\n**Mission Statement**\n\nTo provide the best in patient care and promote community health.\n\n**Vision**\n\nCrouse Health will provide an exceptional experience as the most trusted system for\nhealthcare.\n\n**Values**\n\n **C** ommunity - working together while appreciating our differences\n **R** espect - honor, dignity and trust\n **O** pen and honest communication\n **U** ndivided commitment to quality and the patient experience\n **S** ervice to our patients, physicians and employees\n **E** xcellence through innovation and collaboration\n\n##### Culture, Quality & Finance\n\nOur culture, quality and financial health are key to our continued\nsuccess - one area cannot be successful without the others. A\nstrong culture, a major competitive advantage for Crouse Medical\nPractice, leads to improved quality which leads to financial\nstability.\n\n##### Strategic Pillars\n\n![fo Finance](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice_image_9_13.png)\n\n![Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice_image_9_14](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice_image_9_14.png)\n\n![Pa System Integration](/Users/sriks/Documents/Projects/FrontShiftAI/data_pipeline/data/parsed/Healthcare_Crouse_Medical_Practice_image_9_15.png)\n\n---\n\n##### Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity creates Inclusion. Inclusion means we value, respect and support each other and\nthose we serve - regardless of background or position - so that each person can be\nsuccessful in his or her work.\n\nDiversity isall of the ways we are different as individual people - the characteristics of who\nwe are with both attributes acquired through our life experiences and our lifestyle preferences.\n\nOur culture and values support diversity and inclusion by:\n\n Embracing new ideas and solutions from all members of the team\n Recognizing differences, valuing each other: this includes our patients, co-worker’s\nand our community\n Being compassionate, expanding awareness of different opinions, viewpoints and\nperspectives\n\n##### Employment\n\n##### Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits employers with 15 or\nmore employees from discriminating against applicants and employees with disabilities. It also\nrequires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who\nare qualified for a job, with or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform\nthe essential job functions of the position.\n\nCrouse Medical Practice complies with all applicable laws concerning the employment of\nindividuals with disabilities and acts in accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The company does not discriminate\nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring,\nadvancement, discharge, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of\nemployment.\n\nWhen a job applicant with a disability requests accommodation that can be reasonably provided\nwithout creating an undue hardship or causing a workplace safety risk, he or she will be given\nthe same consideration for employment as any other applicant.\n\nCrouse Medical Practice will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals (candidates and\nemployees) with disabilities so that they can perform the essential functions of a job, unless the\nrequested accommodations result in the following:\n\n A direct threat to the safety or well-being of the individuals or others in the workplace\nand the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation; or\n An undue hardship to Crouse Medical Practice.\n\nIndividuals who are currently using illegal drugs are excluded from coverage under the company\nADA policy.\n\n---\n\nThe Human Resources department is responsible for ensuring the above practices, including\nthe resolution of reasonable accommodation, safety, direct threat and undue hardship issues.\nContact Human Resources with any questions or requests for accommodation.\n\n##### Employee Classification\n\nEmployees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt for pay administration purposes, as\ndetermined by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nThe definitions of the worker classification categories can be summarized as follows:\n\n *Exempt -* Employees who meet any of the FLSA’s exemption standards, including\nmanagerial, supervisory, professional, sales or administrative employees.\n\nExempt employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their full-time or\npart-time status.\n\n *Non-Exempt -* Employees whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption standards.\nOvertime work is prohibited without specific supervisor authorization for these\nemployees.\n\nNon-exempt employees are subject to applicable overtime provisions of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act and New York Labor Law, and are eligible for benefits based on their fulltime or part-time status.\n\n##### Employment Resignation and Termination\n\nTermination of employment is a part of activity within any organization, and many of the reasons\nfor termination are routine. If you wish to resign, we ask that you notify your manager of your\nanticipated departure date in the form of a written statement. To be eligible for rehire, nonexempt (hourly) employees are required to provide at least two (2) weeks advance notice, and\nexempt (salaried) employees are expected to provide at least four (4) weeks advance notice\n(unless otherwise specified within an employment contract).\n\nUpon resigning from Crouse Medical Practice, you should continue to provide the company with\nan accurate home address for tax purposes for at least one year.\n\nIn the case of termination due to resignation, retirement or a permanent reduction in the work\nforce, a calculation will be done to determine if the employee is eligible for a Paid Time Off\n(PTO) payout. Once you have given notice, the use of any further PTO time must be\nspecifically approved by your manager. For further information regarding use of PTO please\nrefer to CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014.\n\nIf you fail to report to work without informing management of the planned absence, we will\nassume that you have voluntarily resigned per CMP’s Absenteeism and Tardiness; Discipline\nPolicy #600-002.\n\n---\n\n##### Employment Status\n\n**FULL-TIME** - Employees who work at least 32 hours per week are considered full-time. Such\nfull-time employees are eligible for benefits after applicable requirements for length of service\nhave been met.\n\n**PART-TIME** - Employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered to be parttime and are eligible for some benefits. Employees who work 20 hours or less per week, or who\nwork on a temporary project basis, will receive all legally mandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s\nCompensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits), and are not eligible for other\nemployee benefits.\n\n**PER DIEM** - Employees who are employed to provide flexible staffing without a guarantee of\nhours. These employees are not eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except legally\nmandated benefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits).\n\n**CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE** - Employees who have a written contract with CMP that defines\nthe scope of their benefits with the organization.\n\n**TEMPORARY** - Employees engaged to work either part time or full time on Crouse Medical\nPractice’s payroll, but have been hired with the understanding that their employment will be\nterminated no later than the completion of their specific assignment. This category includes\ninterns and co-op students. Such employees may be either “exempt” or “non-exempt” but are\nnot eligible for Crouse Medical Practice benefits except benefits except legally mandated\nbenefits (i.e. Worker’s Compensation, NYS Disability and Social Security benefits).\n\n##### License and Certification\n\nIf your job classification requires licensure or certification, during the initial hiring process, you\nmust present the original copy of licensure/certification to Human Resources or an online\nprimary source verification must be completed prior to beginning employment with Crouse\nMedical Practice.\n\nYour continued employment in that classification depends on proper maintenance of the\nrequired licensure or certification. It is also your responsibility to notify the New York State\nEducation Department, Office of Professional Licensure, and/or other relevant\nlicensing/certification governing bodies, of things such as: name change and change of address\nnotification (when applicable). This will ensure you receive renewal notices in a timely manner.\n\nPrior to the expiration date, any licensed or certified employee of CMP is responsible for\nrenewing their license and/or certification in a timely manner. The renewed license\ndocumentation must be provided and/or verified online through a primary source website prior to\nthe expiration date. If an employee fails to comply with this procedure, they will be unscheduled\nfrom work until it is received and may be subject to disciplinary procedures, up to and possibly\nincluding termination.\n\n---\n\n##### Identification Badge\n\nWhen you begin working at Crouse Medical Practice, Human Resources will assist you in\ngetting your photo identification badge.

You cannot deface the ID badge in any way (this includes placing\nunauthorized stickers on the ID badge). All patients have the right to know the name and\nfunction of any person providing healthcare services to them.\n\nIf you lose your ID badge or it is stolen or damaged other than in the course of your job, you\nmust pay a fee to replace it. A replacement badge is available through the Human Resources\nDepartment.\n\nThe ID badge is property of the hospital and must be returned to the CMP Human Resources\ndepartment upon termination of employment.\n\n##### Employment Verification\n\nAll employment verification and reference requests must go through Human Resources.\nAuthorized Crouse Medical Practice representatives will only provide dates of employment and\njob title(s) held while working here.

Employees\n\n---\n\nengaging in any action of discrimination on the basis of any legally protected class or status\nrecognized by local, state or federal law will be subject to corrective disciplinary action up to and\nincluding termination.\n\nAn employee who alleges an employer has violated [New York Labor Law] Section 203-e may\nbring a civil action against the employer in any court of competent jurisdiction, which may award\ndamages, injunctive relief, reinstatement, and/or liquidated damages. Liquidated damages will\nequal 100 percent of the damages award unless the employer proves it had a good-faith basis\nto believe its actions complied with the law. In addition, separate civil penalties are available if\nan employer is found to have engaged in retaliation or retaliatory personnel action against an\nemployee for exercising rights under Section 203-e.\n\nPlease contact Human Resources with questions or concerns.\n\n##### Internal Transfer and/or Promotion\n\nThe company strives to retain employees through an environment that creates opportunity and\nencourages advancement.

Current\nemployees are welcome to apply, as are external candidates. All staffing decisions will be made\nwith the position goals in mind, with the desire to hire the most-qualified individual being\nparamount.\n\nAt times, positions may be filled internally without being posted. This could relate to a business\nneed or a planned career progression that includes an employee being assigned new\nresponsibilities.\n\nIn order to be considered for a transfer or promotion, you should contact Human Resources and\nexpress interest in pursuing the opportunity. Details regarding internal transfers can be found in\nCMP’s Internal Position Transfer Policy #600-019.

By completing Form I-9,\nthe employer is certifying that it has viewed documents proving that the potential employee is\nauthorized to live and work in the United States.\n\nAll employees are asked to provide original documents verifying their right to work in the United\nStates and to sign a verification form (Form I-9). If an individual cannot verify his or her right to\n\n---\n\nwork within three (3) days of hire, Crouse Medical Practice must terminate his or her\nemployment.\n\nPlease contact Human Resources with questions or concerns.\n\n##### Unemployment Insurance\n\nIncome protection in case of unemployment is provided depending upon your average weekly\nearnings as determined under New York State unemployment law qualifications.\n\n##### Workplace Conduct\n\n##### Code of Conduct\n\nCrouse Medical Practice has adopted a Code of Conduct to provide standards and guidance by\nwhich employees, providers, volunteers and other individuals affiliated with Crouse Medical\nPractice will conduct themselves (collectively referred to as “Employees”).\n\nThe Code of Conduct is a fundamental part of Crouse Medical Practice’s Corporate Compliance\nProgram, and works together with our Mission, Vision and Value statements and our Corporate\nCompliance Policies and Procedures.\n\nCMP’s success as a leading healthcare provider is dependent upon each employee of our\norganization - our commitment to personal and professional integrity, our responsibility to act in\ngood faith, and our obligation to do the right things for the right reasons.

Instead, the Code contains principles that are\nintended to guide Employees in making ethical decisions in carrying out duties for or on behalf\nof Crouse Medical Practice. All Employees share in the responsibility to uphold the principles of\ncaring, honesty and integrity that are fundamental to this Code of Conduct.\n\nPlease refer to the full Code of Conduct Policy #100-001, your supervisor or Corporate\nCompliance Officer with questions.

The amount of damages\nmay be reduced if the violator self discloses the violation. In addition to the penalties above, any\nviolation could result in, but not limited to, criminal proceedings.\n\nThe law was revised in 1986 to expand the definition of “knowingly” to include a person who:\n\n Has actual knowledge of falsity of information in the claim;\n\n Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information in the claim;\n\n Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information in a claim.\n\n**Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 USC §§ 3801-3812 (PFCRA)** . PFCRA provides for\nadministrative remedies against any person who knowingly makes a claim or statement that the\nperson knows or has reason to know is false, fictitious or fraudulent. The presence of a false\nclaim is not required: a false statement is enough to trigger remedies under PFCRA with civil\npenalties up to $5,000 for each such statement and/or claim. This is addition to an assessment\nof not more than twice the amount of the claim or portion of.\n\nFalse Claims suits can be brought against individuals and entities. The False Claims Act does\nnot require proof of a specific intent to defraud the Government. Entities and individuals can be\nprosecuted for a wide variety of conduct that leads to the submission of a false claim.\n\nNYS Laws pertaining to criminal penalties for false claims and statements include NYS Social\nServices Law 145 & 366-b, NY Penal Law 155, 175-177, and NY Insurance Law Section 403.\nFurther detail on these can be found in the CMP Compliance Plan.\n\nWhistleblower or “Qui Tam” Provisions\n\nIn order to encourage individuals to come forward and report misconduct involving false claims,\nthe False Claims Act contains a “Qui Tam” or whistleblower provision. The Government, or an\nindividual citizen acting on behalf of the Government, can bring actions under the False Claims Act.\nAn individual citizen, referred to as a whistleblower or “Relator,” who has actual knowledge of\nallegedly false claims may file a lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. Government. If the lawsuit is\nsuccessful, and provided certain legal requirements are met, the whistleblower may receive an\naward ranging from 15% - 30% of the amount recovered.\n\nEmployee Protections\n\nThe Federal and State False Claims Act and New York State Labor Laws §§ 740 and 741 prohibit\ndiscrimination by Crouse Medical Practice against any employee for reporting suspected\nnoncompliance in good faith.

All administrative rules and processes as well as\nchanges in plan benefits and premiums apply to those on continuation coverage.\n\nQualifying events for employees that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:\n\n---\n\n Voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than gross\nmisconduct\n Reduction in the number of hours of employment\n\nQualifying events for spouses that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:\n\n Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee’s employment for any\nreason other than gross misconduct\n Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee\n\nQualifying events for spouses that allow up to 36 months of benefit continuation:\n\n Covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare\n Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee\n Death of the covered employee\n\nQualifying events for dependent children that allow up to 18 months of benefit continuation:\n\n Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee's employment for any\nreason other than gross misconduct\n Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee\n\nQualifying events for dependent children that allow up to 36 months of benefit continuation:\n\n Loss of dependent child status under the plan rules\n Covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare\n Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee\n Death of the covered employee\n\nIn the event of divorce or legal separation, or the loss of dependent child status under the plan,\na covered employee or dependent must notify Human Resources within 60 days to maintain his\nor her COBRA rights. Within 14 days of that notification, Human Resources will provide\nenrollment materials to the employee or covered dependent.\n\nThe covered employee or dependent has 60 days from either the date that coverage would\nordinarily have ended under the plan due to a qualifying event or the date of notification,\nwhichever comes later, to elect continuation of coverage. Election of coverage is established by\ncompleting and returning enrollment materials to Human Resources.\n\nCOBRA premiums will be billed by the applicable insurance provider. The first premium will be\ndue within 45 days of the date of election. Subsequent premiums must be received within the\nterms set by the provider. Failure to make timely payments will result in termination of coverage\nwithout notice.\n\nContinuation coverage will end after 18 months if the qualifying event was a termination or\nreduction in hours, unless the qualified beneficiary is disabled at the time of the qualifying event,\n\n---\n\nin which case coverage may extend to 29 months. For all other qualifying events, continuation\ncoverage will end after 36 months.\n\nEarly termination of COBRA continuation coverage will occur if:\n\n Crouse Medical Practice discontinues its insurance plan;\n The qualified beneficiary fails to make a premium payment in a timely fashion; or\n The person who elected continuation of coverage becomes covered under another\ninsurance plan or Medicare.\n\n##### Domestic Partnership\n\nCrouse Medical Practice offers health insurance and other benefits to employees’ domestic\npartners and their children, whether those partners are of the same or opposite sex.\n\nIn order to qualify as a domestic partner under this policy, an employee will be asked to sign a\nstatement testifying that he or she lives in an exclusive and mutually committed relationship,\nsimilar to a recognized marriage.

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available to employees and their\nfamilies to provide confidential help with a wide variety of personal problems, issues and\nconcerns.\n\nUse of EAP services, however, does not excuse you from complying with company policies and\nprocedures, or from achieving job requirements or expectations during or after receiving EAP\nassistance. Participation in the EAP will not prevent the company from taking disciplinary action\nwhen warranted.\n\n##### Employer-Offered Insurance\n\nYour employment status determines the benefits that you are eligible to receive.

HSA contribution election changes will become effective no later than\nthe first payroll after the change request is filed.\n\nAs a result of termination, a reduction in work hours or in the event that an employee goes on\nmilitary leave or takes another extended leave of absence, an employee may be eligible to\ncontinue the organization’s group coverage by paying the monthly premium.\n\n---\n\nEmployees are urged to consult the insurance summary plan description for details of the plan\nbenefits.

In the event that an employee is able to return to work\nunder restrictions, the company will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the\nemployee’s work ability and job responsibilities.

For this reason, we provide a Paid Time Off (PTO)\nprogram to all full-time and part-time employees. PTO provides employees the freedom to\ndecide how to use their time off. PTO does not replace the Company holiday schedule.\n\nEmployees can use their PTO days in a number of different ways; for example:\n\n As vacation\n For personal business\n For periods of illness\n For religious observation\n For doctor or dental appointments\n For personal or family emergencies\n In the event of severe weather or adverse driving conditions\n\n##### Paid Time Off (PTO) Eligibility and Accrual\n\nAll full-time and part-time employees are eligible to earn PTO. While employees accrue PTO\nhours on a monthly basis (pro-rated for part time employees), CMP will distribute the total\namount of PTO time in two equally divided “buckets” to current employees in the beginning of\nthe first pay period of the year and after July 1 of each calendar year.\n\nTime allotted will be reflected in hours (i.e. - the number of PTO days x 8 hours per day):\n\n Non-exempt (hourly) Employees: PTO will be recorded in fraction of hours to equal the\nemployee’s total scheduled hours for that day. PTO time is available to use following the\ncompletion of the 90-day probationary period for new hires.\n Exempt (salaried) Employees: PTO will be recorded in 4 and 8 hour blocks. If an\nexempt employee works 1-4 hours in a given day, they must record 4 hours of PTO. If\nthey work greater than 4 hours they do not report any PTO time. If they work less than hour they must report 8 hours of PTO time. PTO time is available to use the first of the\nmonth following the date of hire for new hires.\n\nWhen an employee terminates their permanent employment, a calculation will be done to\ndetermine if the employee is eligible for a PTO payout. An employee terminated for cause or\nwith less than 12 months of service will not be eligible for any terminal PTO pay. Employees\n\n---\n\nmay roll up to forty (40) hours of PTO from one calendar year to the next unless otherwise\nspecified in an employment contract or offer letter.\n\nUnless specified otherwise in an employment agreement or offer letter, PTO time is earned as\noutlined in CMP’s PTO Administration Policy #600-014.\n\n##### Personal Leave\n\nCrouse Medical Practice complies with all federal and state leave laws. However, when these\nlaws do not apply or an employee does not meet the eligibility requirements, the company will\nconsider an employee’s request for a personal leave.\n\n##### Time Off to Vote\n\nCrouse Medical Practice encourages all employees to vote. It is the policy of Crouse Medical\nPractice to comply with all state election laws with respect to providing employees time off to\nvote.\n\nIf an employee has four consecutive hours, either between the opening of the polls in his or her\ncommunity and the beginning of the workday or between the end of the workday and the closing\nof the polls, it will be deemed that the employee has sufficient time outside his or her normal\nworking hours in which to vote.\n\nIf an employee has less than four consecutive hours in the time periods described above, he or\nshe may take up to two (2) hours of working time to vote. This time is eligible as paid voting\nleave, and such time shall be taken only at the beginning or end of the employee’s workday as\ndesignated by his or her supervisor.\n\nEmployees requiring working time off to vote will be required to notify their employers at least\ntwo to 10 working days before the day of the election.\n\nTime off to vote is paid and does not count against an employee’s accrued Paid Time Off\n(PTO). Questions should be directed to Human Resources.\n\n##### Information and Office Security\n\n##### Computer, Internet and E-mail Usage\n\nCrouse Medical Practice (CMP) recognizes that use of the Internet and e-mail has many\nbenefits and can make workplace communication more efficient and effective. CMP has\nadopted these email and computer use policies in a manner which helps to prevent Protected\nHealth Information (PHI) from unauthorized disclosure; maintains secure computer/network\ninfrastructure; ensures availability to its users; and complies with federal and state laws. This\npolicy outlines the company’s guidelines for acceptable use of the Internet and e-mail.\n\nThis policy must be followed in conjunction with other Crouse Medical Policy (CMP) policies\ngoverning appropriate workplace Code of Conduct. CMP complies with all applicable federal,\n\n---\n\nstate and local laws as they concern the employer/employee relationship, and nothing contained\nherein should be construed to violate any of the rights or responsibilities contained in such laws.\nUnacceptable use of the Internet and e-mail can place CMP and others at risk. Therefore,\nemployees are expected to use the Internet and e-mail systems appropriately.\n\nFor further details and information regarding computer usage, see policy Computer, Internet and\nE-mail Usage Policy #1100-001.\n\n##### Emergency Evacuation Plan\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recognizes that there may be situations where we will need to\nevacuate our facility. The safety of our employees, patients and visitors is of the utmost\nimportance.\n\nPlease refer to your site specific Emergency Evacuation Plan for further details.\n\n##### General Practices\n\n##### Attendance\n\nIt is the expectation of CMP that an employee will be at their workstation ready to work at the\nstart of their scheduled shift, as well as upon their return from a scheduled lunch and/or break.\nAdditionally, CMP understands that there are times that an employee may need an unscheduled\nabsence as an emergency. In these instances it is the expectation that the employee will\ncontact their supervisor prior to the beginning of their scheduled work hours.\n\nFurther details are available in the full Absenteeism and Tardiness Policy #600-002.\n\n##### Background Check\n\nCrouse Medical Practice carefully selects quality employees. Background checks help to ensure\nthat new employees have the skills and licensure for the job and have performed well in the\npast.\n\nChecking professional and personal references is an important part of the background check\nprocess. This provides the company with information on the potential employee’s work ethic,\nskills and performance.\n\nInformation obtained from the background check process, including information from\nprofessional and personal references will be used by the company only as part of the\nemployment process and will be kept confidential by Human Resources.\n\nCrouse Medical Practice conducts background checks on all job candidates after a contingent\noffer of employment has been extended.

Please consider the following in\nregard to this:\n\nYou are responsible for addressing concerns with a manager, from complaints to suggestions\nand observations.

All of these parties are willing to listen to the issue and assist in a resolution.\n\n##### O rientation Period\n\nFor all employees hired by Crouse Medical Practice, you must attend general orientation at\nCrouse Medical Practice Administration located at 739 Irving Avenue.

During this time, the employee will undergo training and orientation as\n\n---\n\ndirected by the employee’s supervisor. The employee’s supervisor will also monitor the\nemployee’s performance during this time.\n\nDuring the first 90 days of employment, the employee is encouraged and expected to ask\nquestions concerning his or her job responsibilities, and to determine if he or she is satisfied\nwith the position. If the employee’s job performance is found to be unsatisfactory by his or her\nsupervisor at any time during the first 90 days of employment, the orientation period may be\nextended or employment may be terminated.\n\nAll new employees will receive a confidential performance evaluation from their supervisor at\nthe end of the orientation period.\n\n##### Recording Working Time\n\nEach shift, non-exempt (hourly) employees are required to record their work time by accessing\nthe Time & Attendance system via the computer.

The payroll office or Human Resources will\nassist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any\nquestions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit.\n\n---\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for\nemployees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will\nbe electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated\nby each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or\ncredit unions that support direct deposit.\n\nIt is each employee’s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal\ninformation and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has\nbeen an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not\nentitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid\namounts from future paychecks.\n\nPaychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be\nreleased to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the\nemployee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on\nthe date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or\nshe returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day.\n\nIf an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to\npayroll information through the Company’s payroll service provider.\n\n##### Performance Evaluation\n\nCrouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,\nabout your job performance.

In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally\ndiscuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may\nbe conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position.\n\nYour performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas\nneeding improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance\nproblems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal\ndiscussions or formal disciplinary action.
