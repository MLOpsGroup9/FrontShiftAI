The employee’s supervisor will also monitor the\nemployee’s performance during this time.\n\nDuring the first 90 days of employment, the employee is encouraged and expected to ask\nquestions concerning his or her job responsibilities, and to determine if he or she is satisfied\nwith the position. If the employee's job performance is found to be unsatisfactory by his or her\nsupervisor at any time during the first 90 days of employment, the orientation period may be\nextended or employment may be terminated.\n\nAll new employees will receive a confidential performance evaluation from their supervisor at\nthe end of the orientation period.\n\nRecording Working Time\n\nEach shift, non-exempt (hourly) employees are required to record their work time by accessing\nthe Time & Attendance system via the computer. It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure\nthat your time is correctly recorded (i.e. by punching in and out of your shifts, every day).\nDetailed instructions will be given to you by your supervisor.\n\nFailure to properly record your work time may be subject to disciplinary procedures, up to and\npossibly including termination.\n\nOvertime Pay\n\nCrouse Medical Practice must compensate all hourly, non-exempt employees one-and-a-half\ntimes their hourly wage rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours each week. PTO and\nCompany Holidays do not count towards the calculation of overtime.\n\nThe company’s workweek begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\n\nAt times, employees will be asked to work overtime to complete necessary work tasks. The\nemployee's supervisor will notify the employee as early as possible regarding scheduling needs.\n\nEmployees who want to work more than 40 hours during a workweek must receive authorization\nfrom their supervisor before working overtime.\n\nPay Periods and Check Distribution/Direct Deposit Voucher\n\nThe standard pay period at Crouse Medical Practice consists of two (2), 7-day, 40 hour weeks\nand starts on a Sunday and ends on the second following Saturday. Employees will be paid on\na bi-weekly basis on Friday. If paydays fall on non-workdays or holidays, employees will be paid\non the last workday prior to the regularly scheduled payday.\n\nIt is the policy of Crouse Medical Practice to offer employee's the option to receive payments via\nelectronic direct deposit and/or live payroll check. The payroll office or Human Resources will\nassist employees with completing the necessary documentation as well as answering any\nquestions, concerns or changes relative to direct deposit.\n\n32|Page\n\n---\n\n## Page 39\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for\nemployees, including greater security and faster access to funds. Direct deposit payments will\nbe electronically deposited directly into one or more checking or savings accounts designated\nby each employee. Accounts must be established with financial institutions, such as banks or\ncredit unions that support direct deposit.\n\nIt is each employee’s responsibility to review his or her payroll stub for accuracy of personal\ninformation and payment information. Employees must immediately notify Payroll if there has\nbeen an underpayment or overpayment of wages, or an error in deductions. Employees are not\nentitled to keep wage overpayments and Crouse Medical Practice may recoup overpaid\namounts from future paychecks.\n\nPaychecks will be given to managers/supervisors to distribute to employees and will only be\nreleased to the individual whose name appears on the check or to an individual whom the\nemployee has designated and approved through written consent. If an employee is absent on\nthe date of paycheck distribution, his or her check will be held in Human Resources until he or\nshe returns or will be mailed the Monday following pay day.\n\nIf an employee chooses direct deposit of his or her paycheck, he or she will have access to\npayroll information through the Company’s payroll service provider.\n\nPerformance Evaluation\n\nCrouse Medical Practice is committed to providing you with feedback, both formal and informal,\nabout your job performance. Managers and supervisors are responsible for providing ongoing\nperformance feedback to each employee. In addition, your manager or supervisor may formally\ndiscuss and document your performance on an annual basis. An initial performance review may\nbe conducted within 90 days after an employee is hired or transfers to a new position.\n\nYour performance appraisal discussion will review your strengths and identify any areas\nneeding improvement, and goals and objectives that need to be achieved. Specific performance\nproblems may be addressed outside the performance appraisal cycle through either informal\ndiscussions or formal disciplinary action. Formal performance feedback becomes a permanent\npart of your personnel file. Please contact Human Resources if you have any questions.\n\nPersonnel Records\n\nCrouse Medical Practice strives to keep accurate and up-to-date personnel records.\n\nEmployee personnel files may include the following:\n\n  Employee demographic information\n  Job application\n  Position description\n  Resume/CV\n  Training records/Educational Degrees/Certifications\n\n 33 | P a g e\n\nCrouse Medical Practice recommends direct deposit as it provides many benefits for\nemployees, including greater security and faster access to funds.
