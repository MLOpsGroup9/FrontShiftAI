This includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, voice mail, Internet activity, text\nmessages, pictures, images, objects, writings, words, gestures, or physical contact.\n\nIn general, discrimination and harassment can be deﬁned as conduct that disparages or shows\nhostility or aversion toward a protected status. It can take many forms, including: epithets or slurs;\nthreats; derogatory names, comments, objects or visual depictions; jokes or teasing; and other\nverbal, nonverbal, written, visual or physical conduct that is based on a protected status.\nSexual harassment in particular can include a range of subtle or blatant behaviors and may involve\nindividuals of the same or diﬀerent gender.

For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of their gender, gender identity or\nexpression, or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment, regardless of whether the\ntreatment is motivated by sexual desire.\n\nAdditional examples of sexual harassment include:\n\n- Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as:\n o Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another\n employee’s body or poking another employee’s body;\n o Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults.\n\n- Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:\n o Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target’s\n job performance evaluation, a promotion or other job beneﬁts or detriments;\n o Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities.\n\n- Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or comments about a person’s sexuality or\n sexual experience, which create a hostile work environment.\n\n- Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered inappropriate simply\n because they may not conform to other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a\n particular sex should act or look.\n\n The key symbolizes ownership and trust.

Rather, it is the nature of the conduct,\nhow that conduct is perceived, and the impact that conduct has on others that matters.\n\nA victim of discrimination, harassment or other similar conduct does not have to be the intended\nrecipient of the behavior. It can be anyone who ﬁnds the behavior oﬀensive and feels aﬀected by\nsuch behavior. If you believe you have been subject to conduct prohibited by this policy or become\naware of such conduct, you should report the situation immediately to your supervisor, Human\nResources, or any member of management with whom you feel comfortable. This applies whether\nthe party involved is an employee, someone in management, a customer, a vendor, or any member\nof the public with whom you come in contact as part of your employment. Anyone witnessing or\nreceiving a report about possible harassment must report the situation to Human Resources\nimmediately.\n\nHome Bank will investigate all reports promptly and fairly and in accordance with any legal\nrequirements. While the Bank will maintain conﬁdentiality to the extent possible, complete\nconﬁdentiality cannot be guaranteed, as the duty to investigate and take appropriate action may\nrequire the disclosure of information to individuals with a need to know.\n\nIf Home Bank determines that discrimination, harassment, or other prohibited conduct has occurred,\nappropriate action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. This may include\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees should also know that if they engage\nin unlawful harassment, they can be held personally liable for the misconduct.\n\nRetaliation or adverse action will not be taken against an employee who, in good faith, reports or\nparticipates in an investigation under this policy. Retaliation occurs when an employee experiences a\nnegative consequence because they, in good faith, ﬁled a complaint or participated in an\ninvestigation. Retaliation is illegal and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination, even if no evidence of harassment discrimination, or related conduct is found.\n\n+ Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual’s sex, sexual orientation,\ngender identity or the status of being transgender, such as:\no Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person’s workstation, tools or equipment, or\notherwise interfering with the individual’s ability to perform the job;\no Sabotaging an individual’s work;\no Bullying, yelling, name-calling.\n\nHarassment, whether sexual or based on another protected status, is not limited to the physical\nworkplace itself.

The Bank reserves the right to modify\nthis or any other policy as necessary, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law. State or\nlocal leave laws may also apply.\n\nMilitary-Related Federal FMLA Leave\nFMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related\nmedical and nonmedical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The ﬁrst is\nMilitary Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is\ndetailed below.\n\nMilitary Caregiver Leave\nUnpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family\nmembers who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty.\nThe family member must be a “covered service member,” which means: (1) a current customer or\nveteran of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Reserves, (2) who is undergoing medical treatment,\nrecuperation, or therapy; or, in the case of a veteran, who was a current customer of the Armed\nForces, National Guard or Reserves within ﬁve years prior to the treatment for which an eligible\nemployee requests leave; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, (3) for a serious injury or illness that may render a current customer medically unﬁt to\nperform the duties of the customer’s oﬃce, grade, rank, or rating. Military Caregiver Leave is not\navailable to care for service members on the permanent disability retired list.\n\nTo be eligible for Military Caregiver Leave, the employee must be a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or\nnext of kin of the covered service member. Next of kin means the nearest blood relative of the\nservice member, other than the service member’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following\norder of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by\ncourt decree or statutory provisions; brothers and sisters; grandparents; aunts and uncles; and ﬁrst\ncousins; unless the service member has speciﬁcally designated in writing another blood relative as\nhis or her nearest blood relative for purposes of Military Caregiver Leave. The employee must also\nmeet all other eligibility standards as set forth within this FMLA policy.\n\nAn eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave to care for a covered\nservice member in a single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the ﬁrst day\nleave is taken to care for a covered service member and ends 12 months thereafter, regardless of\nthe method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an employee\ndoes not exhaust his or her 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this single 12-month\nperiod, the remainder is forfeited.\n\nMilitary Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each service member. Consequently, an\neligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every covered service\nmember, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same covered service member. A\ntotal of no more than 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave, however, may be taken within any\n“single 12-month period.”\n\nFurther, FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, nor does it\nsupersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or\nmedical leave rights.\n\nLimited Nature of This Policy\n\nThis policy should not be construed to confer any express or implied contractual relationship or\nrights to any employee not expressly provided for by FMLA.

Next of kin means the nearest blood relative of the\nservice member, other than the service member’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following\norder of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by\ncourt decree or statutory provisions; brothers and sisters; grandparents; aunts and uncles; and first\ncousins; unless the service member has specifically designated in writing another blood relative as\nhis or her nearest blood relative for purposes of Military Caregiver Leave. The employee must also\nmeet all other eligibility standards as set forth within this FMLA policy.\n\nAn eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave to care for a covered\nservice member in a single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the first day\nleave is taken to care for a covered service member and ends 12 months thereafter, regardless of\nthe method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an employee\ndoes not exhaust his or her 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this single 12-month\nperiod, the remainder is forfeited.\n\nMilitary Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each service member. Consequently, an\neligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every covered service\nmember, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same covered service member. A\ntotal of no more than 26 workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave, however, may be taken within any\n“single 12-month period.”\n\n---\n\n## Page 30\n\nWithin the single 12-month period described above, an eligible employee may take a combined total\nof 26 weeks of FMLA leave including up to 12 weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason\n(i.e., birth or adoption of a child, serious health condition of the employee or close family member, or\na qualifying exigency). For example, during the single 12-month period, an eligible employee may\ntake up to 16 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered service member when combined with up to\n10 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child.\n\nAn employee seeking Military Caregiver Leave may be required to provide appropriate certiﬁcation\nfrom the employee and/or covered service member and completed by an authorized health care\nprovider within 15 days.\n\nMilitary Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in this FMLA policy (requirements\nregarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice, use of accrued paid leave, etc.). Military Caregiver\nLeave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations,\nand nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations.\n\nQualifying Exigency Leave\nEligible employees may take unpaid Qualifying Exigency Leave to tend to certain exigencies arising\nout of the duty under a call or order to active duty of a covered military customer (i.e., the\nemployee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent). Up to 12 weeks of Qualifying Exigency Leave is\navailable in any 12-month period, as measured by the same method that governs measurement of\nother forms of FMLA leave within this FMLA policy (with the exception of Military Caregiver Leave,\nwhich is subject to a maximum of 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period). Although\nQualifying Exigency Leave may be combined with leave for other FMLA-qualifying reasons, under no\ncircumstances may the combined total exceed 12 weeks in any 12-month period (with the exception\nof Military Caregiver Leave as set forth above). The employee must meet all other eligibility\nstandards as set forth within this FMLA policy.\n\nPersons who can be ordered to active duty include active and retired customers of the Regular\nArmed Forces, certain customers of the retired Reserve, and various other Reserve customers\nincluding the Ready Reserve, the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve, the National\nGuard, state military, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, Air\nForce Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. A call to active duty refers to a federal call to active duty,\nand state calls to active duty are not covered unless under order of the CEO of the United States\npursuant to certain laws.\n\n The smell of popcorn when you walk into a branch, the care of the staﬀ,\n and the little extra things you do make a positive impression.

In these cases, to the extent the income replacement beneﬁts\npermit, the employee may use earned but unused time oﬀ beneﬁts to supplement these other\npayments, as long as the employee’s total wages for the week do not exceed 100% of the\nemployee’s regular base rate of pay.\n\nLeaves fall into one of three categories:\n\n- Medical leave is for any illness or injury of the employee, including pregnancy and childbirth.\n\n- Family leave includes caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or caring for an immediate\nfamily member with a serious illness or injury. For purposes of this policy, immediate family members\nare deﬁned as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner, child, or parent.\n\n- Personal leave is for all other requests not included under medical or family leave or other Bank,\nfederal, or state leave law and is granted under limited circumstances at the sole discretion of Home\nBank’s management, based on various factors, including the general performance record of the\nemployee and the operating needs of the Bank.\n\nIf the leave is for a medical or family related reason, the leave will be considered in accordance with\nany legal requirements in addition to this policy. To the extent permitted by law, the need for more\nthan one type of leave may be combined, and leaves will run concurrently with any other leaves.\n\nEmployees must provide their supervisor and Human Resources notice of the need for leave as far\nin advance as is practicable. Requests must include documented proof of the need for leave, the\ndate leave is to begin and the expected date of return. Leave requests for the employee’s or an\nimmediate family member’s illness or injury must accompany a physician’s documentation and\nstatement supporting the need for leave. Depending on the nature of the leaves, additional\ndocumentation may be required.\n\nWhen leave is due to the employee’s own illness or injury, Home Bank reserves the right to have the\nemployee examined by a physician of the Bank’s choosing and at the Bank’s expense to support the\nneed for leave. Employees may also be required to provide periodic physician documentation during\ntheir leave to support the need for continued leave in addition to a physician’s certiﬁcation\npermitting them to return to work at the completion of the leave period. Employees may also be\nrequired to maintain contact with their supervisor during a leave at designated intervals about their\nstatus and tentative return to work plans.\n\nWhile on leave, Home Bank will pay for its portion of the employee’s insurance premiums for the\nlength of time of approved leave. The employee is required to make payment arrangements with the\nBank for their portion. Continuation of beneﬁts beyond this period is at the employee’s expense\nthrough COBRA.

Violent or threating behavior may take many forms, including\nphysical acts, oral or written statements, email messages, phone calls, or gestures and expressions.\nExamples include, but are not limited to, intimidation, bullying, threats, physical attacks, property\ndamage, or other direct or indirect conduct that threatens personal safety or property or could be\ninterpreted as an intent to cause harm to person(s) or property. Even casual remarks, joking,\nhorseplay, and unintentional conduct may violate this policy and will be taken seriously.\n\nIf you receive or overhear any threatening communications from an employee, customer or any\nother individual, or you have reason to believe a threat may exist, immediately report it to an\navailable member of management or HR. Contact 911 for threats of immediate harm. Do not\nattempt to intervene with a potentially violent individual.\n\nHome Bank as the property owner reserves the right to prohibit employees from carrying any\nweapons on the premises. The CEO and/or Security Officer may grant the authorization to carry a\nweapon in cases where job descriptions or circumstances warrant. Additionally, in accordance with\nour Internal Investigations and Searches procedures, Home Bank reserves the right to conduct\nsearches for weapons on bank property at any time. Any violations may result in disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination.\n\nWorkers’ Compensation\n\nWe provide workers’ compensation insurance for all employees in accordance with applicable law.\nSince workers’ compensation wage benefits generally do not cover full salary, accrued paid time off\nmay be used to make up the difference between your benefits and your regular base rate of pay.\nOnce all paid time off is used up, you will receive only workers’ compensation benefits. Workers’\ncompensation benefits will run concurrently with FMLA leave, if applicable.\n\n---\n\n## Page 43\n\nReporting Work Related Injury/Illness\nIn the event of a work-related injury or illness, you must notify your supervisor and/or HR\nimmediately.

In the event of\nemergencies that aﬀect normal business operations, the Emergency Response Management Team\n(ERMT) will make a determination whether the oﬃce will be open or closed, and will notify\nemployees by phone, text, email, website, or other possible means.\nBusiness Continuity\nHome Bank recognizes the need to protect employees during an emergency and to have detailed\nrecovery plans to provide for the continuity of operations of the Bank in an emergency or disaster\nsituation.
