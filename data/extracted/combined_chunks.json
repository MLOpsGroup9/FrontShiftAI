It is the intent of management to afford you a safe and productive place in which to work. Toward this end, all employees are expected to be familiar with and to follow basic rules of safety. Accidents are usually caused by carelessness or neglect on the part of individuals.  Fatigue and a rush to complete any given task also contribute to accidents.   Be aware of any tendencies in these regards and remember that safety is the priority.  We also advise every employee to take note of potential dangers surrounding them and not to take needless risks. Within the scope of your training, experience and employment responsibilities, we expect you to seek out and correct any unsafe condition or practice. You are to report to your supervisor immediately any situation which appears unsafe to you and that you cannot correct yourself",

As a business, it is incumbent upon us to address this issue of dating and marriage in the workplace in the form of a company-wide policy. It is not our intent per se to interfere with personal relationships and freedoms. It is our intent to protect the financial integrity, operational efficiencies and morale of our hotels. It is also the intent of this policy to state, up front, the restrictions to which each employee will be subject, thereby reducing confusion on the part of all staff, or favoritism on the part of management.  This policy relates to the following relationships (dating or marital): 1. Where one person is in a supervising role, vis a vis the other person: a. A department head or any other member of that department. b. General Manager and any other hotel employee. c. Departmental supervisor and an hourly staff in the same department. 2",

Any relationship where two department heads or supervisors, which by virtue of the connection between their departments or their function in the hotel, creates a potential conflict of interest by compromising any of the following: a. Properly adhering to and enforcing hotel policies and procedures. b. Judgment and ability to make proper decisions. c. Financial defalcation. d. Alteration of hotel documentation. It will be the responsibility of the more \"senior\" person (department head, supervisor, G.M.) to communicate to the General Manager when a relationship develops. Failure to do so will subject that responsible person to discipline, up to and including dismissal, and/or a unilateral reassignment of either party. Once communicated, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to meet with both parties for the purpose of working out details of a reassignment.  Every attempt will be made, subject to prudent business practice, to reassign one of the persons, in most cases the ''junior\" positions",

The department head is responsible for maintaining proper staffing at all times, so if it is necessary to leave the property at any time during work hours, the employee must do the following: 1. Obtain permission from his/her department head or GM before leaving the property. 2. Punch-out when leaving and punch-in when returning. 3. Check in with his/her department head or GM as soon as he/she returns.

Anyone wishing to visit an employee on the job must contact the front desk, who may contact the employee or department head.

In those days, metal was shipped down \nthe St. John's River and received at the Lake Beresford settlement. \nAfter World War II Robert's father, Paul Jacob joined Rudolph in the family business. Paul’s \nbrother, Ervin Jacob, also worked with the company until 1977.
