1. if we train the doc on multiple documents, will it hallucinate? cause each doc might have diffrent info
    a. if so, solution: fine tune one 1 docs' of each type  we have to test
2. are we combining all the tetx extracted into one or keeping them seperate for metadata, and if so, how is it helpful
3. why name the docs with the domains? how is it helpful? yes for meta data, but why, just the name suffices?
