## 2. Using the Chat Interface

The Chat interface is powered by a Unified Agent that intelligently routes your requests to the right specialist.

### Ask Questions (RAG Agent)
You can ask general questions about company policies, benefits, or the employee handbook.
*   **Examples:**
    *   "What is the company's remote work policy?"
    *   "Do we get tuition reimbursement?"
    *   "How many holidays do we have?"
*   **How it works:** The system searches the employee handbook and provides an answer with citations.

### Request Time Off (PTO Agent)
You can request leave directly through the chat.
*   **Examples:**
    *   "I need to take PTO next Monday."
    *   "Request vacation from Dec 24th to Dec 26th."
    *   "Check my PTO balance."
*   **How it works:** The agent will confirm dates and submit a request for manager approval.

### Create HR Tickets (HR Agent)
For complex issues requiring human intervention, ask to speak with HR.
*   **Examples:**
    *   "I have an issue with my paycheck."
    *   "Schedule a meeting with HR about my benefits."
    *   "I need to report a workplace incident."
*   **How it works:** The agent will collect details and create a formal ticket in the system.
